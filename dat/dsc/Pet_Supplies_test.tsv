My dog loves these treats and I like that they are natural ingredients . I ca n't always find them in the stores , so glad to be able to get them from amazon .	1
I have to golden retrievers who sit near the counter always waiting for treats . These are mixed in with other soft treats and they just about inhale these . I do n't know how healthy they really are , just know the dogs really like them and they are fussy about their treats . I got them on subscribe and save as they do n't last long with two big dogs .	1
My rescue dog is totally picky to the extent that dog treats are totally out of her interests ... but when I ordered this product I was amazed how much she has found to like . Usually , she would walk around with any treat in her mouth , but not eat it ! This went for any treats I 've tried . So , when I read the ingredients inside these treats , I just knew I had found something her fussy taste buds would tolerate. , n I was right . I now order this product often , n it 's nice to see her eat the biscuits n not just carry them around all day . Having the individual bags helps keeps biscuits fresher as they are soft n moist , so it 's a good idea .	1
I have a yorkie terrier who loves this treat . He is a very picky eater , he does n't like a lot of treats . It does look yummy , even to me . Based on the information this treats are fairly healthy . Amazon had a good deal when i bought it . This is my dog 's favorite treat .	1
this is my second time ordering these.I purchased some of them before . I was so happy with them I bought them again , you ca n't go wrong , cheaper than the store , buy it !	1
My trainer had the trail mix at one of our classes , and gave me some to try ... My dog LOVED it ! ! The treats are pretty small , but can be easily broken in half for smaller treats to train with ( especially since he 'll get a whole bag during 1 class ) . They are easy to keep in my pocket without making a mess , so when I 'm walking my dogs , I always have rewards ready ! !	1
A nice variety of small treats . Our girls love them . I have purchased these several times and am very pleased	1
I found these in a grocer when I was out of town and forgot the & # 34 ; small & # 34 ; treats I use in my dog 's treat dispensing toys . These are the absolutly perfect for all the dispensing toys we have ... some other treats are just a bit too big and get stuck . I also like to put a variety in his toys ... I 'm sure I care more about this than he does : - ) but it 's nice to only need 1 bag to get a variety .	1
My dogs and I are huge fans of this stuff ! My senior loves it because the pieces are soft enough for him to chew , and the others just love the taste . My favorite thing is that this mix contains healthy ingredients AND comes in small pieces that make perfect training rewards . The mix has regular crunchy milk bones , a chewy version , dehydrated sweet potato , and bits of jerky . Nothing to feel guilty about giving your furball ! ! !	1
My Lab loves these , and they 're a nice size for little training rewards . She gets a few for going into her crate , or for being obedient on walks , and always scarfs them right down . The variety is nice - the other training treats seem to bore her after a while , but these hold her interest . I keep them in a pouch for walks so they 're always handy , and my neighbor 's picky dog ate a few , too .	1
Our two small dogs really like these treats . Our stores stopped carrying these so I had to find them elsewhere . And Amazon was my savior once again !	1
Our dog loves this trail mix and tries to manipulate us whenever we go near the kitchen treat jar . I appreciate the ingredients being all natural . I would highly recommend this product .	1
Jane is a 40 pound medium size dog . She loves this . I put a little on top of her food , think of it as whipped topping on pie . Or in a food dispenser toy . Good for training to . This is not just for small dogs.Milk-bone is a good name . Most of the dog treat recalls are for small boutique , and regional brands . Fancy is n't necessary , dogs do n't care . This is good because they like it and it 's small size .	1
the trail mix is one of tipster 's favorite treats , and it is fantastic to be able to have trail mix delivered via amazon subscription !	1
My little Shih Tzu , Tonka loves these treat and my Ragdoll cat , Teddy loves the beef & potato pieces too . Just the perfect size for a treat for them .	1
My dogs love these , I use them to lure them back inside or to reward them for good behavior , just a couple bits is all it takes .	1
My dogs love this treat but Amazon stopped carring the large container so now I must purchase the small bags ( 4 at a time ) and I replenish the large container . I use it as a treat and also to train my dogs .	1
I have bought this in my local stores but found it here in a 3 pack and for less so ... .. SCORE ! ! ! My boys love all the bits but they adore the square bits that I thought were doggie approved chocolate until I read the package and realized that they are actually beef . They love the sweet potato too but it takes a backseat to the beef . This 3 pack is very handy since I have 4 dogs . I use these heavily right now as I am using them as a house-training tool . They are small enough that I do n't have to worry about the excess calories , but big enough that they get a big taste to motivate them to do their business outside . I have small dogs and these are the perfect size but if you have big dogs you might want to stick to something a bit bigger , like a traditional Milk Bone , otherwise you will go broke affording these . But if you have small dogs these will most likely become a go-to treat ! My boys love to see the red bag come out of hiding ! If they could ask for it by name , THEY WOULD !	1
I can not longer find this in my supermarket . I love that it has sweet potatoe bites and the pieces are small so I do not mind giving my dogs these treats often . They love all the different pieces inside . My dogs are 28 lbs each so these are perfect treats for training or just a quick & # 34 ; good dog & # 34 ; !	1
Well , what can be said ? ? ? My dog loves these treats , and it 's a super deal . the same product in the store is 25-50 % more expensive and then I have to go get them ... on here they drop them to my door and it 's the same product . You just ca n't beat that .	1
My dogs love these , they think they are wonderful . I like to hide them around the house and make them find them	1
I have a very large standard poodle and he is always wanting a & # 34 ; cookie & # 34 ; , these are very small and will not add to his bloating problem and he loves them ! They are wonderful as a training tool also . I keep several bags on hand at all times , I would be in big trouble with the giant poodle if I were to run out !	1
Our husky/Shepard loves these ! Fairly healthy , small pieces , so it 's not a big deal if we give her a handful while practicing commands .	1
Although I prefer foods and treats with meat as the first ingredient , This Milk-Bone offering is like a guilty pleasure for my girls . There 's beef in them thar treats , but listed sixth in the ingredients after brown sugar . On a positive note the ingredients are all natural with NO artificial preservatives No corn , and No artificial flavors.Our pampered pooches have small mouths , especially Piper the shih tzu , and for them these diminutive treats are sized perfectly . The little bits are a mix of soft and crunchy , but not too hard or crunchy . Trail Mix passed the taste test from the first offering and Piper can be quite fussy when given something new . With their small size and taste appeal , these make great rewards or training treats . The inclusion of SWEET POTATO forced this Potato Head to give this product a try .	1
Trail mix for dogs - who 'd have thought they had such a thing ? I found this first in my local big box store , and my dog went bonkers over it . I like that if has sweet potatoes and other yummy things in it , and that it 's small ( one -bite - size ) . I have a hound who is all nose , so when she 's really bored , I throw a handful of this trail mix out into the yard and tell her to & # 34 ; find. & # 34 ; She has fun sniffing out every piece , and yet still eats her dinner . This came in a 3-pack , and each one has a resealable top - that 's so important for not finding uninvited & # 34 ; critters & # 34 ; in it later . There are both chewy and crunchy bits in the mix , and they obviously have a good smell ( according to my hounds wagging tail ) . I highly recommend getting this for your furry friend !	1
I bought this hoping to have a backup playpen for our new pets . When we rescued a sick kitten ( 8 wks ) from an abandoned house/yard we soon discovered it had Giardia ( parasite ) and have kept him separate from our other male kitten ( 12 wks ) . This pen can also double up as a little den for animals with it 's side door . Perhaps for dogs/cats in the yard ? The & # 34 ; Small & # 34 ; size pen is comfortable for average cats or puppies but if you have a medium/large animal I 'd look for something bigger . Some dogs would make light work of it I 'm sure . I 'm biased here but it 's simply amazing for kittens , especially if they need a & # 34 ; time out & # 34 ; or you 're introducing a new cat/kitten to existing pets or just want to keep one safe/secure . Our 2 kittens play through the pen now so they 're off to a good start thanks to this ! If you have frolicking puppies or crazy cats - you might find they can mess with it . To give some idea about the durability , my oldest kitten is capable of biting/scratching holes in me but has yet to be able to damage this pen in his play with the new little'n . He plays so very hard I 'm convinced he 's part tiger.Honestly for the price it 's definitely worth it . I 'm glad I bought it - one of my best buys on Amazon now I think about it .	1
Was n't sure whether this would be of good quality or not , ,but i have been surprised to see that it seems to be well made . Great item to make your small pet more portable .	1
It 's the perfect thing to use along side a crate to potty train a new puppy ... .also , I fold it and take it with me whenever I am visiting freinds ... ... .this way I know that my puppies wo n't be leaving any surprises at their homes ! DEF RECOMMEND THIS ! !	1
My cat likes to sleep under my bed because she likes to have something over her . I live in a 550 sq ft apartment and all the play pens I found were too big . This is the perfect size and easy to ensemble . Just throw a couple of blankets in there , or if your pet is spoiled like mine , a memory foam bed.. anyway , this is perfect if you are looking for something small for a cat or a small dog . My parents have the large one for their chihuahua . I 'm not quite sure why but she likes to too . For the price , you ca n't beat it !	1
LUV it . It sits on my bed and my smallest chihuahua sleeps in it at night so he is contained and can not fall off the bed . Its well made and it folds up quite small and flat so I can travel with it . The zipper top makes it easy to clean out and the side zipper door rolls up to keep it open so the dog can go in and out at its leisure during the day .	1
This play pen is perfect ! I have a Maltese and I take this with me when we travel . Great for containment , packs easily . She is n't very hard on it since she is a small dog , it holds up well .	1
I bought this for my new shih-poo puppy to take to grandma 's house so I would n't have to lug her crate there . Its super light weight and durable and it 's great that it folds completely flat . I also love how theres a zip-on cover for when she gets bigger . It 's definitely tiny , but perfect for her and my 10 lb toy poodle to share comfortably . Such a great buy for any pet parent .	1
i uses this when me or my mom take a nap . our 16 yr old chihuahua whines and cries the whole time we sleep . we cover this with a light blanket and not a peep . just big enough for him .	1
I was surprised at how lightweight this playpen is -- it 's a breeze to carry ! The mesh allows ventilation which is important in warm weather , but also allows for shade . I would definitely recommend it !	1
I have a ferret and this is PERFECT for when I got visiting . I had 9 ferrets at once and not this one is the only one left and he is left alone a lot . So I can just pack him up and go.. I love it and thinking someday soon to get a larger one . I have it now open in his room so he gets use to it . I WOULD recommend this for your tiny traveling buddy .	1
This is the perfect size for my puppy . My mom is not to happy with PETs in her house and now when I go over to visit my puppy can come along and stay in his play pen . Very useful item .	1
We got a puppy , a Maltipoo and he cried and cried in his crate . I originally bought this as a place to put him during the day when I could n't keep a full eye on him while potty training.However , I soon realized how much he loved his space here . He 's got his bed and his toys and really sleeps well in it . It 's now his full time `` crate '' he does not go potty in here.My only problem is that the area where the zipper attaches to the fabric has ripped , I 'm considering sewing it , or just returning . Would def have to order a new one before returning because pup would be lost without it . At $ 30 it 's a steal !	1
just the right size.my chihuahuas has yet to rip this up . i love the ziptop . the babies are 6lbs and 3 lbs and could n't get out of it	1
It small easy to open strong I got it a few days ago I would recommend it is just got little yorkie so this will suite him just fine also once your dog is small breed what i also love about this pet pen aSo it opens and folds in few seconds so neatly fits in Conner	1
The Doggie Play Pen was perfect for my needs . I am able to confine my puppy when I could n't watch him . I would recommend this play pen for anyone that has a toy breed puppy .	1
Its unfortunate my puppy is growing up fast ! ! ! ! He only used his play pen once but I am giving it to an acquaintance for their use since they are getting a new puppy too .	1
I got this because I just started fostering kittens and thought this would work great for a mama cat with kittens . I could leave the top open so Mama could jump out , eat , use the box and streach out a bit and the babies would be warm and safe while she did that . I have n't used it yet , but it 's so nice . I could even put the kittens I have now in it for safe keeping while moving them while I clean a room or showing them to adopters . This is a good size , for a small dog or as I plan to use it . Easy to open and easy to pack up . GREAT buy ! !	1
I say I think it works with a question and let me explain why . The kitty I bought this for is scared of everything it seems . He is scared of loud noises , visitors , storms ... you name it . I had family coming to visit so I purchased this hoping it would help . I bought a small but now I realize I should have sized up since he is a long-haired kitty . I put it on him and he immediately just fell over . From watching presentations on tv I knew this would happen . He eventually got back up but seemed to have a little trouble walking normally . When family came he still ran and hid . He did n't seem comforted at all . Now another kitty in my household who weighs about 3 lbs more than him also has issues but usually only with storms . When a storm blew in I grabbed the Thundershirt . Now since she is bigger I could n't wrap it around her but I could wrap the neck area and drape it over her . She seemed comforted . So in short , I think the Thundershirt will work depending on the kitty . Also think about sizing up for long-haired babies .	1
My cat is very skittish , especially about going to the vet . Unfortunately , she has epilepsy and required medication . In order to get refills of the medication , her blood levels have to be checked every six months to be sure it is in the safe range . Every time the vet needs to draw blood , she has be sedated because she will not stay still enough . This is obviously not good for her , and also costs $ 80 each time . I decided to try the Thundershirt in order to reduce her stress and the stress on my wallet . I was very skeptical but ended up being pleasantly surprised . Sedation was not necessary this time . She growled and hissed but did n't struggle at all . It was a complete transformation . For that reason alone , the Thundershirt is worth it . I 've already saved $ 40 because of it.I occasionally travel and must bring the cat along because of her medical issues . She does not tolerate the car well so that may be my next trial . Even if it does not work for that , it was a good investment.However , I did need to take a star off because the fit of this is way off . My cat weighs about 9.5 pounds so I opted for the medium . It is very large around the neck with a large amount of extra fabric . While barely fitting around the neck because it is too large , it barely fits around the belly because it is too small . I have to stretch the shirt as much as possible to fasten it around my cat . The proportions of this really should be reworked.Overall , I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is considering it . It is an especially good tool for vet visits and I wish I 'd found it earlier .	1
I work as a veterinary technician bought this product for use at my vet clinic . I have found that it works great for scared cats that want to run or the cats who just wo n't hold still . They tend to just freeze and stay still which is great for blood draws and exams . The chest strap never seems to get tight enough but I have used it without the chest strap and it still works great . In general , the sizes run a little small . It is labeled for 9-13 lb cats . That is only if they are at their ideal weight . It will not fit a fat and round 11 lb cat . However , it does fit cats smaller than 9 lbs without any issue . I have n't been able to use it on the really hostile cats because they wo n't tolerate me putting it on . It is pretty easy to wrap an angry cat in a towel when their feet are also restrained . However , it is not easy to wrap something around their chest when all their claws are still ready and able to strike . Great for scared cats in flight mode but not for really hostile ones in fight mode .	1
I was in the pet store looking around and was joking with the clerk that I have a little man who absolutely looses it if I try to cut his toe nails . His hair falls out and he turns into the Tasmanian Devil . I do n't want to take him to the vet to get them done , but I may not have a choice . So I was kidding that I really wished they made a straight jacket for cats . She recommended this product . She took it out of the box and put it on one of the store kitties . I love it when pet stores have store kitties . The cat she put it on was a starlet type of cat , very outgoing and a ham , the store greeter . After she put it on him , he turned into dossal little snuggle butt.I was skeptical and asked if I could return it if it did n't work . I got it home and put it on my little Tasmanian Devil and I could n't stop laughing . He just was so relaxed , I mean like flipping a switch . I did get to cut a couple of nails but I think I would have been much more successful if I was n't so stunned at the difference it made in my cat and laughing so hard . I 've ordered a large one for my baby girl because she is the other extreme . She freaks out a lot . We 'll see .	1
This works fairly well for short-term use on one of my cats . He definitely seems more relaxed and mellowed while wearing this . It 's good for travel and vet visits . I do n't have to give him anti-anxiety meds for that anymore , which is awesome . However , I bought it as one of many , many things I 'm doing to try to address his ongoing separation anxiety , so I wanted him to wear it basically all the time . The package says that it 's okay to do this . I see no physical reason why one could n't do this once the cat is used to it , but after about a week of wear , Mario started seeming kind of lethargic . Maybe even depressed . He was n't constantly crying anymore , but he did n't want to play , either . I got concerned and took it off . Put the bounce right back in him . Now I only use it for acute anxiety with things like vet visits , etc . Did n't work for what I needed it for , but it 's generally a good product and does work for short-term anxiety.As for the other cat ? He does n't like it . I 've gone through a couple months now of slowly acclimating him to it , and he 'll wear it for maybe 20 minutes max . I ca n't allow him to wear it unsupervised because he has attempted to get it off and gotten partially stuck in it . He has also nearly hurt himself doing things like trying to get up/down the cat tree after getting just one leg out and similar stunts . So , not really for him .	1
I bought this at a local pet store in hopes that it would help my lovable , if slightly neurotic , Siamese mix , Bunny . Bunny has a multitude of problems : allergies , Feline Hyperestesia Disorder ( which we lovingly call & # 34 ; demon cat mode & # 34 ; ) , OCD , etc . If there is a crazy/problematic cat about , I will find it and love it forever.To help with her allergies , we switched vets and , well , Bunny hates the vet . I 'm pretty sure if she was in the kitty mafia , there would be a hit out on my mild mannered veterinarian . Hissing , clawing , and growling are pretty much nonstop from the second we enter until we leave . Bunny LOVED her old vet ( she fell asleep while he drew blood from her leg ) , but I 'm pretty sure that she thinks the new vet is the spawn of Satan.Anyway , we bought the Thundershirt to help with two things : Bunny 's & # 34 ; demon cat & # 34 ; episodes ( think climbing walls , howling/crying at the ceiling , and running full tilt around the house . She 's insane ) and her extreme hatred for the new vet . The Thundershirt has helped with both of these . We catch her during her episodes , swaddle her up , and she usually calms down right away . The Thundershirt and a good does of kitty happy drugs usually deals with the aggression towards the vet.As an added bonus , Bunny usually thinks she is the most pathetic creature ever while in the Thundershirt and she cries at us for love and snuggles , thinking that if we sympathize with her , the shirt will come off . So she goes from totally insane to snuggle beast . Over all , I 'd say it 's about 80 % effective for what I was hoping it would do ( she still growls at the vet , but no lacerations ! ) . I have left it on her for long periods of time with no problems ( other then her being extra annoying all night . You do n't adopt a Siamese without expecting them to be somewhat bothersome , though ) .	1
I have had people laugh at me but these really do help my nervous little kitty . She relaxes and is not so stand offish . Give it a try .	1
Well I did not believe it would actually work - but it did.And for a cat that has never played & # 34 ; Dress up & # 34 ; ? He did fine after being bundled into this the first time.It truly is easy on and off - as the Velcro means no sliding over legs and head.I need to put this on at least 1 hour before a Thunderstorm for it to have maximum effect.And also helped with fireworks anxiety ( Indoors ) .Would recommend to anyone whose dog or cat has anxiety issues .	1
Bought this to ease our senior kitty 's anxiety at the vet ( she goes at least every 6 months ) . Works great ! She `` wears '' it only during the car ride and in the waiting room - the fit is pretty snug & I would n't want her to wear it for more than an hour or two at a time.You do need to acclimate your cat to wearing the thundershirt ( and , really , any similar non-collar thing - like a harness ) . Kitty is clicker-trained ; we taught her to lay down on the thundershirt , then to tolerate it being worn like a cape ( just with the neck velcro closed ) , then started putting it on her when she was laying down for a nap , then rewarded her for wearing it as intended.The velcro is really loud .	1
I have used several models of remote trainers in my history with dogs . I have trained herding dogs and also bird hunted with these same dogs that showed an ability and desire . In all things consider your type of dog and what job he would like to do when selecting your dog . It is only in the past ten years when I have had many strange dogs with unknown histories and habits that I started using remote trainers . My dogs are all other people 's discards and yet they are now well behaved with children , adults and new dogs . They have learned to trust me but they also know that they must obey commands . All dogs should sit and stay on command . I also teach my dogs to back up on command so that they do not rush to doors or staircases . I use electronic trainers to prevent accidents : getting run over by running into the road or in front of vehicles . Attacking other animals such as chickens or cats can be prevented quickly when dogs learn the negative consequences of what they might consider `` fun '' . This is when they are really valuable . This trainer is simple and the manual is very concise and easy to understand . You must carry the trainer and always use it properly to get results . I think that this is an excellent model for dog owners who are not familiar with remote trainers . There is no replacement for a relationship with your dog based on mutual respect and affection . The remote trainer should only enhance this with further off leash training . So many people get dogs these days and have no knowledge of their needs . That is why I have a dozen dogs .	1
Havahart Remote Trainer is an electronic training device designed to help control a dog 's bad behavior . Whether it 's barking , chewing , jumping on people , or anything else , this device attempts to get the behavior under control.The way this device works is simple enough . You attach the collar to your dog , grab the hand- held device , select one of the five levels of stimulus with a tone , or only the tone , and wait for your dog to misbehave . When your dog does something you do not like , you press the button . The collar then sends a shock to your dog and sounds a tone . The idea is , of course , to get your dog to associate this unpleasantness with its bad behavior and , eventually , cease to misbehave.So , does it work ? Well , yes and no , but part of the potential problem is that many dog owners will expect this training device to do it all ; eliminating bad behavior quickly , with the press of a button , that has been going on for a long time . If this is your expectation , it may or may not work . Yes , the dog will feel the shocks and hear the tone and most dogs will realize they need to stop what they are doing . But with other dogs , it may not work well at all . The best way to make sure it works most of the time is to start by training your dog the old fashioned way first , then use this device . I should point out that Havahart explains this in the manual , but many buyers will ignore this and use the device expecting miracles.If you train your dog first , then attach the collar , you should have a good degree of success . My dog is smaller- weighs about 25 pounds- and this device has worked well and has successfully stopped some of his bad habits , like incessant barking and chewing on shoes and other objects . I have found that the shock treatment is n't really necessary after a short time . He now associates the sound of the tone as a signal to stop what he is doing . This is good , because using the shock , I have to admit , concerns me a little and I can understand why some dog owners will not like this feature at all . But the good news is that you do not have to use the shock- you can select tone only and rely on the unpleasant sound to correct your dog 's behavior.This dog training device does seem to work , but I still have a few issues . The battery cover takes too much effort to remove and the hand held device seems very cheaply made . It just seems like a matter of time before it breaks . The flimsy construction makes me question the price , but I suppose if it works well enough to stop bad behavior , most will consider it money well spent.Dogs are prone to badness and the Havahart Remote Trainer is good at getting these problems under control . As long as you work with your dog first , then start using the training device , you should have good success . The electric shock could concern some dog owners , so my advice is to use it sparingly and then try to quickly switch to the tone- only training for a more humane training experience . Use it the way it was intended , and you will be well on your way to a better behaved canine .	1
There is some controvery about using static correction when training a dog . Static correction is a nice way of saying `` small electric shock '' . I 'm not going to debate the issue but will say there are times when other training methods may not work . In my personal opinion I prefer trying this method rather than giving up on a very loving , rescued animal.Included in the box are the training collar , the remote , the manual , a training guide , batteries for both the collar and the remote , 2 sets of probes ( long and short ) , and a tester in case you do n't want to test it on yourself . Both the collar and the remote are quite light in weight but seem to be of good quality . The remote can be used with two collars at a time by simply pressing a button to switch from collar 1 to collar 2 . When pressing the warning ( tone only ) button the letter `` A '' is displayed as well as which collar . When using the correction button the level of correction is displayed as well as which collar . If you use it with two collars , the remote remembers the correction level of each so you do not need to constantly adjust it . Correction levels are changed with a quick button press . Since the behavior I 'm trying to correct occurs in my house I have not had the opportunity to check the range.The dog I 'm working with is a problem barker and other methods have failed . I next tried using an automatic anti-bark collar which instead of curbing his barking turned him into a frightened , nearly neurotic animal . What this somewhat hard-headed Australian Kelpie needs is something that allows me to work directly with him so that he better understands why he is receiving the correction . Enter the Havahart Remote Trainer.The Havahart trainer allows for two different correction modes , Warning ( tone only ) or Correction . When using the correction there are 5 settings to chose from . Always use the lowest possible setting that will work with your particular dog and use the length of probe best suited to his or her coat . With my Kelpie I use setting 2 with the short probes . Because of the probes , a static correction collar should never be left on a dog for more than 12 hours . I prefer using it for a much shorter period of time . Because the barking is an intermittant problem it is difficult to have an actual training session . Actual training sessions would be helpful when training to sit , stay , heel , lay down , etc.The way I use the collar to train is to wait for him to begin barking in the house . As soon as he barks I say `` quiet '' and hit the warning button . If he does n't stop at that time , I again say quiet and use the correction button . As soon as he stops barking I praise him and give him a treat . Although we 've only been using the training collar a short time he is already beginning to respond to the warning tone button.I like the Havahart system and believe that with consistent training the problem barking will eventually become a thing of the past . Once the barking is under control I will probably use the collar on one or more of my other dogs who have some habits that the collar will help correct , such as ignoring my commands when they are n't on a leash.Please , please do not use a static correction collar as a substitute for proper training . It is a training aid , not a substitute . The more you work directly with your dog the happier you both will be.Why only a 4-star review instead of 5 ? I think the collar should be engineered to fit with the description in the manual rather than re-printing the manual . When using the correction I think it would be beneficial for the collar to sound the warning tone while giving the correction as it suggests in the manual . It does not . Thinking I had a defective unit I made of couple of returns to Havahart before their Customer Service was alerted that the manual contained a printing error . Regardless , the Havahart Customer Service gets a 5-star rating for their courtesy and promptness of service . If only the Collar would sound the tone in conjunction with the correction then I would be able to rate it 5-stars as well .	1
One of my pure german sheperds , that are all big as mini horses it seems , needed a tiny bit of correcting with a jumping habit . This gently and quickly corrected her behavior . Its lightweight and easy to use . The only reason I did not give it five stars is I wish it had a way to turn off the battery when not in use . I take it off of her regularly to make sure it doesnt ' irritate her skin in any way . I would purchase this again if needed .	1
This collar and remote signal set can train one or two dogs ( add a collar to train Dog # 2 . ) HOWEVER ... .it CAN NOT be used on puppies . So you must wait until your doggie is at least six months old to employ this trainer . That limits its use in a way , as puppies need training day one , but you 'll just have to use other methods ( we use the tether method ; the doggy is near or with me when at home , and areas of the house are blocked from access . ) Why wait until six months ? Puppy skin is tender , therefore baths have to use gentle shampoo , clipping is out and likewise , this collar is too much for the puppy . You can deliver either a static tingle ( shock ) or a tone or both . If the dog is energetic and refractory , a tone plus shock is probably the way to go , but some people object to any form of pain in training , therefore , the tone is available alone to reprove the dog 's behavior.Part of dog training is to signal your displeasure IMMEDIATELY when the behavior is happening ( tearing into shoes , chewing on the cat box contents or barking for no good reason ) so this is helpful to let the dog connect what he 's doing with what you desire or do not desire . It 's no good reproving the pooch after a few seconds -- the dog has no way to connect what he was doing with your opinion of it . Hence , this is very useful.This is especially helpful for 2 year old dogs , who go through `` teenage adolescence '' at that time and can suddenly be unruly . Just do n't use it on a puppy .	1
I got this because my husband wanted to work with our dog to stop barking and jumping up on people . He said it was easy to use and set up , and that it works well . You can give your dog a warning beep before it zaps her , and he said 95 % of the time , all he needs is the warning beep for her to cease the bad behavior . We have n't had any issues with it not cooperating or working , have n't had any battery issues or anything else.Thus far , we 've been very pleased with this product .	1
Let me start by saying we have an electric fence for our 3 dogs . My 5 year old basset hound , Maggie , as a puppy checked the perimeter of our backyard for a break in the fence , and she found one at the end by a large bush and our garage.Of our 3 dogs , she is our training challenge . She wants it her way or no way . This collar helped break her of her back habits such as going in the garbage right in front of us , climbing on the furniture , and jumping on people . No level of verbal correction would stop her , but the collar did.You must have the remote with you at all times and be ready to send the signal . The signal travels about 100 yards.I would recommend this product but only if the dog 's people family is willing to follow through with a consistent training program .	1
What I wanted most from this is the remote beep . I have a very timid boxer and the beep is all we needed to use as a training tool to get him to return to us at a dog park or when he wonders too far . Do n't think you do n't have to put in the time with this sort of device . It is not a cure all and many animals just get too wound up to be corrected with a shock . The shock is just meant to get the dogs attention in an abnormal situation . The only con is it is not the most heavy duty trainer we have used . I hope this one will last .	1
My beagle mix is an incessant barker . I first tried the collar using the medium setting which provides a brief shock when the remote is depressed , along with a tone which is unpleasant to him . I was a little nervous using the shock mechanism , but after a couple weeks , I no longer needed to use that feature , because he now associates the noise with his `` reward '' for barking .	1
Our dachshunds were always running into the neighbors yards when we 'd let them out , so it was either take them both on a leash each time ( which was very time consuming ) or risk having the neighbors aggravated while we chased them through their yards ( which was also time consuming ) .We followed the instructions in the booklet and set up the flags with the system turned off and walked the dogs around the perimeter on a leash , explaining that these were `` bad flags '' . Every time we took the dogs out , the older one got better about avoiding the `` bad flags '' . When we finally turned the system on and used no leashes , the older dachshund decided to test the boundary and got zapped . That did it for her , she decided the flags were indeed bad and has done very well staying within the boundaries . The younger one , who is usually easier to train , is still having difficulty understanding why she gets a little shock when she gets too close to the flags . She does n't cross them , but she seems to still be curious about them , gets too close and gets a little zap . I can hardly stand it ! She does n't yelp or cry , but you can see the muscles in her neck tense up . The older dog no longer goes near the flags at all.I would say this product works very well and was surprised at how quickly the dogs caught on . It makes it so much easier when they have to go out !	1
Train your dog to stay within the boundary that you create . Building a secure play and exercise area.Training involves 3-4 sessions of ten to twenty minutes of each session . There 's 4 steps for training and each step takes roughly three days , this does depend on the personality and breed of your dog . I have chosen to w2alk my dog on a leash as the first step for a week , thereby getting familiarized with the system.You are able to choose between 5 levels of correction , including a `` tone only correction '' . The other option is a shock , if you decide to use it.I have not . If you decide to use this , it has a safety shut-off feature.It works by distance to the boundary line . As a dog wanders towards the boundary , he will hear a warning tone , As he steps closer to the boundary he 'll hear another tone with `` low level correction '' .There are five width settings from 3 '' to 24 '' .The package includes :1. water resistant collar receiver2 . collar probes ( 2 sets for long & short haired dogs ) 3. disposable lithium battery4.wall mounted transmitter/control box with hardware ( this unit has power & loop lights ) 5. power transformer ( AC adapter ) 6. boundary wire7 . training flags and cards8 . 1 year warrantyinstruction manualtest lightThe system includes everything that you 'll need to enclose an area of up to 1/3 acre.A dog lying still or relaxing will activate `` sleep mode '' , saving the battery .	1
this keeps my dog in ... she ran through it once and did not know how to get back in but after the training period it works nice . I still pref a real fence because this does not keep kids or other dogs out and a determined dog can bolt through . I have nothing to compare it to but seems to be a 4 star product .	1
I foster dogs and have a lab mix that is a fence climber.. I was skeptical that this would keep him in but it actually works and he stays away from the fence now..Was easy to lay in front of my pipe fences.. Now when diesel goes to chase something in my pasture or see someone in the road his collar emits a sound warning him.. He actually stays- I would like to get another collar for my other dogs but they are very pricey.. This is a great system.. Going to do a video of how well it works-	1
Great fence that allowed me to train my dog . I own a basset hound which is very stubborn and likes to follow his nose . Installation was easy and we do not have to worry about him disappearing .	1
Seriously , my beagle runs after anything ! And not at a cute , lumbering speed like my Bernese Mt Dog . She BOLTS like she was shot out of a cannon , full-tilt , head up , tail down , like a maniac ! We have resorted to putting her behind a baby gate if we are going to be in and out of the house a lot , because one little slip-up and ZOOM ! She 's out like a dart . Chasing anything that spurs her little hunting dog instinct . Anything from a dangerous postal carrier or speeding car breaking our subdivision 's 25 mph by a mph or two ... .to a leaf blowing across HER yard or the scent of a neighbor two blocks away grilling their dinner . Yup , everything sets her off running ! Well , now she has her little collar on and because she is so smart , she only got too close to the flag/fence line three or four times . The collar emits a warning signal , letting her know she is getting close to where it will give her a static notice . The same day we put this on her , she has stayed clear of the fence line . Now , if she does get past us , into the yard , she does n't even go full-tilt ! As soon as she gets out , she is a little cautious , but still very enthusiastic ! She goes out , and is alert , but not darting up the road . It 's like she instantly became a guard dog , not a crazed runner ! Love it . Glad I have it.Easy to install . We used the end of a shovel and just pushed the tip into the ground in a kind of semi-circle , then laid the wire in . No problem.Our house is a lot more calm now ! Normally if the doorbell rang we all jumped into action , to our posts ! Grab the beagle ! Put up the baby gate ! Try not to stand in the doorway to talk to whomever was at the door ! Ack ! This Havahart Fence Free Containment System makes things a lot nicer for all of us.Sheri Gill - Writer , Mom , Mage !	1
Let me tell you the pros and cons of the `` Havahart Fence Free Underground Dog Fence '' .Pros:1 . Simple instructions , Easy setup2 . Humane3 . Works fastCons : As for cons , there are none that I can really think of aside from the fact that if your yard is small and close to a road this system WILL NOT instantly stop your dog from running after cars and possibly getting hit until it learns the boundaries and stops ( which can take anywhere from a day to a month depending on your dog ) .Personally I love this ... Once I set this up in my yard it only took a few days before my dog learned not to pass the boundaries , now she does n't keep running off and getting all muddy and I do n't have to give her a bath every day ! YAY : )	1
I use this product and it works perfectly . I do n't use it so much for pet confinement , I actually have a real fence ! However , my beagles are ALWAYS trying to dig under , rendering the wooden fence useless . I try filling the holes with bricks and/or large rocks , but that does n't stop them , they just go to a new spot . So what I did was actually staple this wire to the wooden fence . Works like a charm ! Now my dogs wo n't go near the fence , and it benefits me in a number of ways . Now , when I am going in/out and leave the gate open , they do n't try to wander out . Also , they do n't run up to the fence and bark at the neighbors dogs ( labs ) anymore , they just ignore them ! It was always annoying , but eventually the labs learned that my beagles wo n't bark back , so even they stopped ! All-in-all , this is a great product and you NEED to follow the instructions , be patient , and train your dog properly . I tried letting my Beagles figure it out themselves for a couple days , and they were too dumb to understand where the shocking was coming from and why . So I used the enclosed training instructions and it worked like a charm . Now they know exactly where their borders are , and they now think that the wooden fence is the source of the shock , so hopefully it translates to any yard that we may move to with a fence , because I wo n't be pulling this thing out and taking it with me .	1
Prior to setting up and testing the Havahart Ultrasonic Basic Trainer , we used the E-328B Remote Control Training Collar with satisfactory results . Attaching the collar and using the remote controller is/was a bit of a pain , as we did not want the collar continuously affixed to the puppy . Chewing furniture and jumping on guests are the unwanted behaviors we are confronted with . In addition to the 2 Duracell batteries included in the box , the Ultrasonic Basic comes with step by step operating instructions with some visuals , training tips and most importantly the toll free number to call for questions and issues seven days a week . The unit comes with a Lifetime limited warranty to boot . Since we do not have a barking problem we started operating the Trainer manually with associated voice commands.. Although , using the automatic for excessive barking is the way to go ! The unit is simple to operate , and in our case works as advertised for the issues we have with the puppy - so far ! The Trainer has several neat easy to use features , i.e . auto mode and power on lights , frequency selector and manual correction buttons , and a low battery light . However , while the operating instructions are sufficient , we found the following link to a youtube video an invaluable instructional aid . [ ... ] Overall , this is an excellent replacement of the collar and remote control system we have being using . A slick system - recommended .	1
I 'm not sure if there are more effective anti-barking products out there , but the HAVAHART ULTRASONIC BASIC does get my Shiba 's attention.For the most part , she 's quiet but whenever a stranger comes into the office or the doorbell rings she 'll start barking . I figured this might help and it does , somewhat.First of all , it 's easy to set up and comes with 2 AA batteries . You put it into auto mode at first and it will cycle through the 5 different frequencies until you find the one that your dog responds to . They 'll look up or at the device and then you just press the `` frequency selector '' button to set it.You have a choice of manual or auto correction , the auto only works for barking . I 've have n't used the auto mode because there are n't enough outbreaks of barking for me to keep it on.When she does start barking I use the manual setting ; I just hit the power and press the `` Manual Correction '' button on the unit . It gets my Shiba 's attention for a second and then she goes back to barking . I 'll also issue the `` NO '' command together with HAVAHART , and that will sometimes get her to stop.In my case , it works better then my just saying `` NO '' and a lot less messier than getting a spray bottle and squirting her with water , which I 've read is another way to stop unwanted behavior , so I 'm giving it a solid 4-stars.According to the directions , there is a small percentage of dogs that will NOT be distracted by the HAVAHART ULTRASONIC BASIC TRAINER so keep that in mind .	1
I have been using a PetSafe Bark Collar for some time now with great success ( I 've also written an extensive review of this product ) but it has always been my intention to wean him off of it since it 's a bit of a hassle ( turning the battery on and off 'requires ' a coin , so I 'm always digging around in my purse first thing in the morning and evening to turn it on/off to save battery life ) and replacement batteries cost $ $ $ . Received this device in the mail today and was super excited to give it a try . Box includes a two page instruction pamphlet , the device and batteries.I followed the instructions to set the initial frequency and was pleased to see that my dog responded immediately to the first tone it gave off . I was n't expecting to be able to hear the 'ultrasonic sound ' myself ... but it certainly is n't loud enough to be a nuisance , I 'd say it was barely audible . My dog did n't act in pain , frightened or upset - just inquisitive to it . After setting the tone , I removed his bark collar , set the ultrasonic device on the sill of his favorite 'barking window ' ( the one my sofa rests against ) and waited . Eventually he jumped up on the back of the sofa to bark at some of the neighborhood dogs being walked and after one-two barks tops he stopped . He did n't shriek away from the window or jump back in shock , he just did that inquisitive 'head tilt ' thing puppies tend to do when you 're trying to teach them something new and he then hopped off the sofa . It 's been about an hour since I 've had this device in place and it has successfully stopped him from going on a barking rant off the back of my sofa twice now and even once by the front door which is about 15 feet away and in the opposite direction from where I currently have the device resting/pointing towards.So far , I am giving this a 5 star rating because it actually DOES work for me . I 'm skeptical however that this will continue to act as a long-term deterrent and I 'm curious to see if he will eventually become accustomed to the tone and see it as nothing more then background noise , like the television or radio . I 've read some comments where it seems some people expected this to be a negative reinforcement device ( that the tone should have created some sort of discomfort ) but from my dog 's reaction , it seems to me like this is probably no different then the high pitched tone a dog might here from a dog whistle - and I do n't believe that dog whistles are necessarily intended to be a negative deterrent when used properly . I will come back to add to this review to address whether or not it continues to deter his barking for more then just the hour I 've had it in operation . Even if it does n't work long term as a barking deterrent , I 'm already thinking of other ways I could use this as a general training tool since I know he can hear the tone and it conveniently has the option to issue a manual tone at will ( perhaps I could use it like a clicker , since my dog does n't seem to hear 'clickers ' very well or at all like my last dog did ) .In case anyone is curious , my dog is 2.5 years old , 10lbs , male , Shih Tzu . He responded well to bark collar training but like most dogs , knows the difference between when his collar is on or off . He learns new commands and tricks quickly and is n't defiant/does n't have an alpha type personality . Will update my feedback/thoughts on this item once I 've had more time to observe its long-term effectiveness . ***UPDATE******7/6/12***************My update as promised - So far , so good ! I have not used his bark collar once since I 've started using this device as I have n't felt the need to do so . I 've since moved the location of this device from the windowsill that he barks out of to the coffee table ( directly in front of the sofa/window ) out of fear that the sunlight/heat might wreck havoc with the batteries - and it 's working perfectly fine even at this distance.What I 've observed so far is that this device does not prevent my dog from barking altogether but it has eliminated his nuisance barking ( non-stop barking like a little maniac ) . He still hops on the back of the sofa to bark at neighborhood dogs being walked in front of the house and he 'll still bark when another dog is barking outside , but it 's limited him to 3 , 4 barks tops before he stops on his own.Now that the device is on my coffee table , I also have a better line of vision to confirm how effective it is at actually 'activating ' when my dog barks ( it does n't say this in the manual but from my observation I can tell you that the lights will flash across the top of the device when activated by the sound of your dog barking , just as it does when you manually press the button ) . However , I think that once it goes into sleep mode there may be a slight delay in response time since on more then one occasion I 've noted that it does n't light up until after his second or third bark . Although he does n't act as if he takes any notice to the device whatsoever , I know he is because by the third day he was sneaking off to the second floor in order to bark out of my bedroom window which also faces the front of the house . He 's NEVER done this before and it 's a great obstacle for him to even accomplish such a feat since it means he has to climb two sets of stairs and climb his doggy steps to the top of my bed - none of which he enjoys doing unless you entice him with a treat . I suppose I could have purchased a second device to place in my bedroom but the quick , easy and less expensive solution was to just shut the door to my bedroom - he is now cut off.On a final note , I 've had two people close to me inquire on whether or not this would be an effective tool at stopping their 'neighbors ' dogs from barking . To that I say No . The instructions do indicate that there is a 25 foot limit on it 's effectiveness and living in a very dog friendly neighborhood , I can say with all certainty ( from personal observation ) that the device will not be triggered by the sound of your neighbors dogs barking . A good thing in my opinion if you 're using it to train 'your ' dog , but unfortunate for those who are tormented by their neighbors unruly pets .	1
First this is not a whistle.. its an ultrasonic clicker . The buzz makes an irritating noise and there is a freq button on the right side to allow you to change which frequency it uses.con - there is no indication of what freq is selected for the human , so you put it up to your ear and cycle through them until you hear the click rate that your dog doesnt like . While it is ultrasonic , when close to your ear you can hear the clicks - just like your hands feel the heat from a stove even though they are not infrared eyes.The no-bark works , even though I was pessimistic with my german shepherd dog who does a 3 way call every night at 6 with the neighbors dogs # 1 you power it on using left hand power button and find the most irritating click frequency using the freq button on the rightnow its ready # 2 you press power a second time . This puts it in auto mode and the tiny auto/power leds alternate # 3 put it somewhere where the dog cant get it but it can hear the dog , and the dog can hear it. # 4 in auto mode it listens for your dogs first 'grace ' bark # 5 if the 'grace ' bark is followed by a 2nd bark , it goes into auto correction mode.The dog will soon figure out only 1 bark is allowed , then it drops to zero pretty quick.There is also a training button which is highly effective . When your dog is chewing on the tv remote , press the correction button and the dog stops . If your dog wo n't go to sleep inside press the correction button and it will change its tune and calm down.Overall the clicking is very effective and that surprised me . Its a non-harmful sound that irritates the dog to stop their action . Whenever the alert ( clicking ) is happening 3 leds ( tiny ) flash left center right center left to let you know its signalling.battery life is excellent , which is also surprising . theres even an auto off featureI took off one star because it is hard to tell what frequency is set .	1
I can see how this item can be very hit or miss and will depend entirely on your dog . Here 's my experience with it : We have a three-year-old female Doberman that is extremely protective of our house . We have a shared driveway with our neighbors , and any time they leave , get home , have guests , go in their backyard , or breathe too loudly , our dog gets into the front window and launches into loud , insane barking . Our living room windows overlook the road below , and she makes sure to warn any runners , dog walkers , or old ladies passing by that she will murder them . We live in a hilly , tree-dense area , and wildlife is abundant . Our dog thinks it is her mission to keep every bird and squirrel in check . We do n't mind that she barks when someone is outside our house , but we would like her to stop when we tell her to . It 's exhausting , and we 've tried everything . So , I figured I 'd give this dog trainer a shot.Our dog seems to be completely insane , so I really did n't think this trainer would have any effect on her . The instructions were easy to read and understand , which made the set up very fast . You have to set the tone that your dog responds to . Ours responded to the first tone , so that made it really easy.The trainer has two settings : manual and automatic . I prefer to use the manual setting so I can use it if my dog does not respond to my verbal command first , so I do n't know how well the automatic setting works . It took me a while to get used to the unit timing out , but it is easy to push the on button quickly , so I have n't had any issues with the auto-shutoff.I have been using this unit for a few weeks and have found that our dog definitely responds to it . While she does have times where she does n't stop barking after giving commands or using the trainer , overall , there have been noticeable improvements in her behavior . * Before using the trainer - She would usually ignore my verbal commands and continue barking . * The first week using the trainer - If she ignored my first command , I would use the trainer . Most of the time , she would start to growl instead , but often she would woof once and then come to me quietly . * The second week using the trainer - If she ignored my first command , I would use the trainer . Most of the time , she would skip the growling , woof once , and then come to me quietly . * The third week using the trainer - She seems to respond to my first command more often , so I do n't need to use the trainer as much.Overall , I like this device , but since it does n't seem to work with many dogs ( which the company discusses in the item description ) , I think the $ 50 price tag might be a little high . I would hate to spend that much and have it not work for my dog .	1
I have a `` jumper '' . A dog who sees a person and can not contain her excitement until she can jump on them and lick them . My mom has a `` barker '' . A nervous little chihuahua that barks everytime a random noise is heard . I purchased this for my mom since nothing else seemed to work . Sadly , this item did n't work either but it did give us info on why our other attempts had failed . My mom 's puppy is deaf . Very , VERY deaf . So , I decided to use this for my jumping problem and it worked well . It got her attention and with different settings , I could fine tune it to the pitch that worked best for her . I 've never been a fan of sonics or shock collars but this one is n't too bad .	1
I also have the Pet Safe BC-1000 which I use more often because of it 's simplicity . I thought this would be more to my liking because of the setting in which I can make the `` alarm '' sound only upon manually pressing a button . I have 2 Cockapoos and one does n't seem to be bothered by the sound , thus he mainly changes his behavior based on my voice command . The other dog however seems to really dislike the ultrasound . If I just show him the Pet Safe and say `` no barking '' he usually stops right away and goes to lay down on his favorite spot on the couch . What I do n't like about this Havahart model is what I feel is terribly inadequate user display . Basically there are just 2 very small LED lights ; one beside the word Auto and the other beside the word Power . When you first get the unit you need to manually set the `` tone '' of the correction by pressing a frequency selector button on the side of the unit and watch your dog for a reaction . My dog reacted to the first option so I did n't progress further in testing ( per the instructions ) . With only one little blink of one LED light I find the whole thing quite tricky to learn . I need to have the instructions in my hand as I attempt to use the unit . For me , this is just not an intuitive device at all . I even have difficulty telling when it is on or off , when it is in auto or manual mode , and I have yet to even touch the frequency selector setting button again . I certainly do n't want to put my dog through the rigors of being `` zapped '' by the sound when he is n't doing anything wrong ! Perhaps other people will not find this thing confusing and unclear like me . I thought it would be handy , but frankly put , this justs sits on my kitchen counter and I never even pick it up . The Pet Safe model has no on and off which is a drag ; so when the battery is in it 's on and sensing . It takes a 9 volt so I have to plug and unplug the battery if it takes more than me just showing the unit to my dog to stop his barking . Dogs bark and no one should get a dog if they do n't ever want to hear barking . Some barking is good and normal . I do n't want a constant `` on '' unit that `` scolds '' normal behavior , but I have found that if it 's not simple to use and understand , then I end up not using it at all . I read many reviews about these devices before getting one and it seems that some dogs react strongly to the unltrasound and some other dogs do n't seem to mind the sound . I 've got a dog of each demeanor . I bought the first device because I figured if $ 30 will help limit unwanted barking that would be a smashing good deal ! The Pet Safe works for both of us , but I love the on/off and manual control of the Havahart-just when the instructions are in my hand .	1
Dentastix have actually been around for quite a while . Used to be a different shape . When taking my dog for her check ups . The technician always said she had the teeth of a 4 year old yet was 12 ! ! That says something about these Dentastix . I always give her one a day .	1
We love out dog dearly , but he is neither blessed with lovely body odor nor does he have an everlasting fresh breath . He is a small dog ( Shih Tzu ) and he has a great temperament so we ignore these ( occasional ) issues . We have used the Pedigree Dentastix on a couple of times and we have always had similar results - our dogs loves the taste ( he gobbles them up ) but his breath is not noticeably better . Now the question I can not answer ... did it remove plaque from his teeth . I honestly do not have a clue since I am skilled enough to make *before* and *after* comparisons on doggy plaque build-up.Final Verdict - Our dog enjoys the Pedigree Dentastix and it may help to remove plaque so it is probably worth investigating . However , I ca n't guarantee that by using the Pedigree Dentastix that your pooch will suddenly become the canine version of Randy Jackson.4 Stars	1
These dark green chew sticks are the perfect size for my youngest Chihuahua who is about 4 years old . She likes to chew and these will help to clean plaque from her teeth and they do a very good job of almost totally eliminating bad breath , at least for a while . She often has bad breath and does n't like her teeth brushed so chewing is a very good way to clean their teeth as well . I learned from previous experience that it 's much better to keep them chewing and brushing their teeth occasionally so they do n't have dental problems as they get older . My oldest Chihuahua never liked to chew and refused to have her teeth brushed and she ended up losing quite a few teeth as she aged . So as long as my youngest Chihuahua likes to chew then I am glad . She devours these chews in about 3-4 minutes and is coming back for more . These chews are very reasonable priced when compared to some of the other dental chews that cost many times the price .	1
If your dogs love them , they will halitosis clean their teeth . They took my schnauzer about 2 minutes to finish them off . My wauzer , was less then interested . In all fairness , he is an extremely picky dog . He only eats Blue , he is extremely picky when it comes to treats , he is even particular when it comes to human food . My Wauzer likes greenies . But my then my schnauzer does n't . So it 's just dog per dog . But these treats do help cleanup the tarter in your dogs mouth	1
We have four dogs of our own and we foster dogs for a rescue while they wait to find their forever home . We are always careful about what we give our dogs given all the recalls and stories about dogs getting sick and/or actually dying from contaminated food.We asked our vet about these and he said they were fine to use and they are less expensive than Greenies and in our opinion work just as well . We give one every evening as a snack . The dogs love them and chow them right down.Two things , make sure to give the size that is appropriate for you size dog and only give one per day .	1
Well , I ca n't really review this product ( not really my taste ) but I consulted an expert : my dog . And the prognosis is in , he loves it ! When I dangle this in front of him he goes absolutely ape , just as he does for his favorite treats . He does n't ALWAYS respond this way to every treat , but he continues to do so with this one , which tells me he quite enjoys it . And if it is taking care of his teeth at the same time then I 'm happy to give it to him .	1
My dogs love these . I have a long hair chihuahua and a sheltie mix . Both dogs ran up and grabbed these things from me as soon as I opened the package . They smell good ( treats not the dogs ) and once the dogs ate them it did help the breath situation a bit.A good value , a good treat . I say get it .	1
My dogs really love Dentastix . Every night right before I get ready for bed I ask , Do you want a Dentastix ? and the reaction is immediate : pricked ears , alert tails , dancing feet . They want one ! The girls are a variety of ages : 8 , 4 and 7 months . The puppy does n't really get one because she does n't need it yet since her baby teeth are still falling out and my four year old girl does n't necessarily need the breath freshening but my older girl certainly does ! Dolly , at 8 years old , has had Dentastix for a lot of her life but not all of it and she has some pretty good tartar buildup despite our best efforts and it gives her some pretty rank breath sometimes . So I tried her on these and I did notice a difference but not a huge one in reducing her canine halitosis.She did not seem to notice a difference between the green breath-freshening dentastix and the brown normal ones . She liked them just as well as her normal regular Dentastix .	1
My dog absolutely loves these treats and takes it very personally that she 's only given once per day . They are X shaped and somewhat softer than regular dog bones , with the theory being that they help to make the dog 's teeth cleaner , which is something I worry about because my dog does have tartar build up but I do n't want to put her under anesthesia for a teeth cleaning procedure . I just have to take the packaging 's word for it that it helps in this way , but it definitely provides my pup with fresh breath and happiness while she chews her treat so I 'm very satisfied .	1
My dog loves Greenies , and will immediately start chewing away . After giving him one of these he cautiously sniffed it , looked at it , licked it several times , then went away and held it in his mouth for a while before taking a tentative bite . After receiving a verbal approval he slowly ate the rest of it without remorse . His girlfriend across the street , however , could n't tell much of a difference with his breath ... These are different than Greenies in that they are hollow on the inside yet rather long . My dog is small , so I broke this in half for him which was fairly easy to do with my hands and without the aid of scissors . If you 're looking for a Greenie alternative , I 'd recommend giving this one a try .	1
A green treat that helps make dog breath better gives the impression of minty freshness , but Dentastix Fresh Oral Care treats smell like Slim Jims ( beef jerky ) . It is no wonder , then , that dogs love them . For yorkies , I broke them in half , since they are large and not many come in a pack . I smelled their breath and it smelled like ... beef jerky . Of course , the idea is to clean their teeth and promote oral health that will result in better breath . The dogs definitely appreciate it and have fun with the chewy texture .	1
Each pack comes with 9 in them . To try to give them a true test , and since I live with my parents , not only did I give one to my puppy , I gave one each to my parents dogs . My puppy who will chew on any chew stick loved his . My parents recent addition how is about 4 years old , really enjoyed hers , while their older one was only interested in them because the other two were chewing on the sticks , and finally choose not to finish hers , and one of the other two finished it for her . It seems to be a good for oral care , but in the long run it is up to the taste of your dog .	1
One of the problems with products like this is that it 's very hard to actually know if it works . While my dog does enjoy eating the Dentastix , and they do improve her breath to an extent , there is no way of knowing if it reduces plaque and tartar . I have no way to measure that . I think they work well enough as a treat , as long as your dog likes them , but as good dental care ? It is anybody 's guess .	1
These essentially do the same thing as the more expensive Dentabones , but at a fraction of the cost . Puppy likes these and his teeth are beautiful and white . We give him one a day to help him maintain his smile . I 'd reccomend this to any dog owner .	1
Both dogs loved the taste of the treat gobbling it down pretty quickly . I ended up only giving my dogs half treats because of how few in a pack you get and because they were pretty easy to break down the center.The treats did turn my dogs ' poop green for awhile . If you have issues with puppy training I highly suggest you avoid these because you do n't want to try and remove green poop from a rug if they made a mistake in the house.All that said , I noticed no difference in my dogs ' teeth so I ca n't really speak to that but I did not try these for a long period of time so I do n't know about long term effects on their dental hygiene .	1
I bought this because the light fixture on my eclipse died and is no longer available , but the filter is working just fine . The light is very nice . Perfect for my 29-tall tank . BUT , attaching it was a bit of a pain . It can only be attached inside the tank , which means water build up on the fixture . Lots of water . That worried me a bit as I found the instructions and warnings unclear as to whether it is okay for this fixture to actually get wet [ though it says can be attached to bottom of tank , which would be completely submersed ] . That said , the Amazon description says it is fully submersible , so I guess I 'm okay ! Update : Obviously , this light is submersible . But , again , that was n't clear on the instructions . It has been working beautifully now for several months . I will update if/when it crops out !	1
This light is super-bright for its size . THe white and blue LEDs run at the same time , but the white is much stronger so you ca n't tell . ( you can also just run the blues ) It is very versatile as far as how you can apply it to your tank set-up ; clips in to the rim , sits on top of the lid , can be submersed could even be attached to some sort of DIY custom stand pretty easily . I dropped it right out of the package onto the floor and it still works fine so I 'd say it gets an A+ for durability . I As far as longevity , I have had 2 running form several months and no burn outs.UPDATE : several months in and still working very well . Plants growing . ( Dwarf Baby Tears , baby tears , glossostigma , windelov java fern , Dwarf Pennywort ) ( 5.6 gallon Fluval Spec V )	1
good cheap led lighting . I have 3 of them mounted inside my large tank ( along with 3 blue accent versions ) , Cant see the fixtures above the water ( they are low profile ) , and does n't matter if they get wet . This enabled me to build a much smaller hood , since lights are now inside the tank , rather than on top . Just wish all three could plug into a single switch/AC cord .	1
As the owner of a 10g , PLANTED tank , I was a little worried that the light was n't going to be enough . I asked questions and someone told me that for a planted tank , this might/might not work . But I 'm a risktaker , so I took the risk of using this knowing that it could possibly make my plants die.When it arrived , I immediately set it up in the tank . I used it along with a 60w fluorescent bulb for about a week until I had a GSA outbreak . I decided , I have to give this light the benefit of the doubt . So I stopped using the bulb with the LED . I have plants in my tank that require low and moderate to high lighting ; Hygrophila Corymbosa , Amazon Sword , Vallisneria , Java Fern and Anubias . I was more worried about the Sword and Vallisneria . BUT after I stopped using the bulb and trimming the leaves of the Sword that had GSA , I 've noticed SO MUCH GROWTH . My Val 's which were still adjusting to my water and stuff , have now reached the surface of the water and are shooting off runners ( about one every other day ) and the Swords leaves are growing as well . All my plants are thriving very well using this LED light and I really like it . It 's also easy for my to SEE when I 'm doing my water changes as well instead of having someone hold the bulb over the tank while I clean the substrate ( very risky ) .I highly recommend this !	1
I really like this light , I Have it in a standard 29gal , and love that I no longer have to move my light around on my glass tops at feeding time . Brightness its so-so , great for viewing , but I do n't think it would work for a planted tank . I havent had any lights burn out or leakage so far , so I 'll keep my fingers crossed . I also added the 17 in version of this to the back of my tank , looks great .	1
Good product , would buy more if if I ever need another , as listed . A+++ this was cheap in cost but a good product . needs more blue and less white lights for a accent reef light but all and an okay light . no good for a reef light unless you want to show off a blue tank with other lights out , will not help a reef tank grow only for show .	1
I just received this about 3 hours ago . It is just what I expected , fits my needs perfectly and my fish are happy to be out of the dark . Easy to set up , several ways . I used the suction cups . Very happy with this item .	1
These LEDs are awesome . I purchased two of the 21 '' long LEDs for my 55 gallon tank and was so impressed with the difference between florescent hood lighting and these , I took pictures of just the hood lighting and then with these on . Very easy to set up and flexible positioning I purchased one for my coffee table aquarium PLUS my 55 gallon with an overhead LED system ! Take a look at the pictures and they will sell you on this product .	1
I like this light as it is the perfect size for my aquarium . I fit 2 on my 55 Gallon and it is tight but works perfectly.If I have any gripe , it is that there are no separate switches for blue and white light . I wish I could put both of the lighting options on a timer separately.One day I 'll take the switches apart and wire them separately , but for now it does what it 's designed for .	1
I have a couple of these lights . They 're affordable , put out plenty of light , and small . Much better looking than the big , clunky incandescent hood lights that come with most fish tanks . They give off a more natural lighting , however , fish of brighter colors may look a little less colorful than they do with regular bulb lighting . I solved this problem by having one LED light on white light and adding a second and putting it on the blue light setting .	1
I use these in training my puppy and they work just fine , am thinking I might repair a few & # 34 ; no longer squeaky & # 34 ; toys with some of the extras .	1
My dog totally destroys all squeak toys in a matter of minutes so these squeakers are saving me lots of money . Now I just make the toys myself for pennies rather than dollars .	1
Great squeakers ! My terrier loves her squeakers - good thing Mommy can sew - these squeakers help extend the life of dog toys - after all they have their favor toy and when the squeaker dies , not as much fun - not any more - with a little seam ripper and needle and thread - presto changeo watch me put a squeaker in that toy ! My husband said you are really putting squeakers back in her toys - I said not only that but she sits and waits and then brings me more to fix ! LOL .	1
My dog , Tony Danza , destroys pretty much every toy we ever give him.Kongs ? No match ... at all . We have found that the squeaky large kong tennis balls work pretty well.. It takes a little longer for him to destroy those.Why did I buy these ? Now I just buy tennis balls by the dozen , throw one of these in ball . Glue the ball back together , and it works like a charm . I 'm saving a ton of money by just using these . Plus it confuses the crap out of him when I squeeze one of these without a toy . Muahahahaha .	1
I take one of this squeakers to the dog park in my pocket to get the attention of my dogs when I 'm ready to go . Have n't used it in a dog toy , but I can assure you that I am the dog park pied piper whenever I squeak one of these .	1
These scratchers are wonderful . My mom bought them from my account because she bought new furniture and wanted to keep it safe ( er ) from the cats . They work . Very well . They have held up to thorough thrashing ( we 've had them for several months now ) and that 's even without the catnip . My cats love them too . ( We split the box ) We bought in bulk because we did n't think they would last very long , but they 're holding up wonderfully . The cats love wrestling with them and love it even more when we put the catnip on them that comes with the scratchers . Even my inherited declawed kitty loves it . Good investment . The only downside I 've seen are the cardboard shreds . BUT ! ! ! ! ! that is expected . I mean , that 's their purpose , to be used and shredded . So by no means is that a fault of the product or seller . That was what they were made for . Just means that to keep a perfect rug , vacuuming more often . But for saving the furniture ? In a heartbeat ! !	1
My cats love these . They do shred all over the place ( as compared to sisal ) but my cats really enjoy them .	1
Both of my cats were adopted from Kitten Rescue Los Angeles . They are my favorite organization and they go above and beyond not only at their sanctuary but their volunteers and fosters to make sure the kitties they save get the absolute best start in life . I wanted to do a little something for them so I bought these . I have heard that the Kitten Cam kitties and the Sanctuary cats are having a blast using them !	1
If your cat loves these and scratched them to death , and you need to reorder a scratch lounger , this way is value packed over replacing them individually . The style around the cardboard is for your individual taste . Your cat does n't care if it 's `` jungle cat '' , `` zebra striped '' , etc. , and just wants to lounge and scratch on it . The biggest problem might be where to store them until needed .	1
Values prices is right ! My cats shred these to pieces . They also love to sleep on them , hang out on them - all year long - winter to summer . These really get torn apart though , last about 6 months before completely destroyed . I only have 2 cats , but I bring out 4 at a time . I glue 2 together for one extra-wide scratcher , and place 2 in separate spots .	1
We normally used a regular measuring spoon for measuring Angel Eyes for our white dog but since using the scoop as the measure his eyes are completely cleared , so we apparently were not measuring correctly with the regular measuring spoon .	1
This is a handy little tool to have on hand . Gives you the correct amount of powder for the stain remover . I have used it measuring other products also .	1
OMG , how I love the litter genies , and I really like these refills . We have 5 ( five ) litter boxes , and we try to scoop every day . Before the genies , we were wasting a LOT of plastic bags . The price is SO much better than what you would get in the store , and each one lasts about a month for us .	1
now we can use the litter genie and not have to worry about smell and use these refills so cleaning the litter box is fast and easy	1
I have so far only used part of my first cartridge so far . Other things that I have spent money on for my cats have been a waste of money NOT THESE ! The system that these are for is purrrrrrrrrrrrfect ! ! !	1
We love the Litter Genie -- it 's so much easier to clean out 4 litter boxes ! Definitely cuts the odor . So we ordered these refills . **Wanted to update my review on these refills . We have 3 cats and 4 litter boxes and 1 refill lasted 3 weeks , which is pretty good , I think . The Litter Genie really makes cleaning 4 litter boxes so much easier -- no more trying to get our hands on plastic bags , checking for holes in the bags , and having to throw them outside in the garbage right away because of the odor . With the Litter Genie , we can carry it from box to box and empty each one , pull the shelf out , and no more odor ! We do n't have to take it out to the garbage can every time we empty the litter boxes , just when the receptacle gets full . My husband and I both wish we had one of these years ago . The only improvement that would be nice to have , is to mark the plastic when it 's down to the last 2 feet ; a different color or black stripes , maybe . The Litter Genie itself is wonderful and these refills work just fine .	1
These eliminate odor very well . I wish there were more length in each cartridge , but they are great at eliminating odor .	1
I really do love this product ! Only downfall is that they are rather expensive , but when you have four cats and like to keep things sparkling clean and fresh , this is the product to have , and have on hand ! ! I will definitely order them again and again . Absolutely no odor escapes from this receptacle ! ! !	1
A great price for a liter box necessity .	1
These refills are inexpensive and shipping was quick and well packaged . I am most pleased with this product and the refills last a long while . I would recommend this to anyone with cats .	1
You have to buy the refills in order to be able to use the Litter Genie . That being said , these are really ingenius in solving an unpleasant chore . The mechanics of it are very easy to use and just so efficient ! ! Thank you Amazon and the Seller for making it easy to purchase these in bulk , since I 'll be using them for may years ! !	1
The refills fit the Genie as they should . There is a far better price break buying 6 instead of one at a time . We go through a fair amount , that writer of the ad that says you can go up to 2-3 weeks before changing the bag does n't have four cats apparently.One thing we 've noticed is the refills used to be fairly clearly marked so you could tell when you were going to run out . This last batch does n't have the same markings so we actually had the bag come out when it got full . That was kind of messy and not fun to clean up . It might be good to keep track of when you replaced it and approximately how many times you can use it before replacing again so there are no surprises.I know the system is a bit pricey and it 's not perfect . It 's convenient , which I like . It also allows us to put the bags in the trash without doing multiple grocery bags tied tightly so it does n't open and get all over the place .	1
Been using the Genie system for a few years now . Would not go back to the old way of using produce bags that break.The litter is self contained so very little smell when it 's time to discard the bag .	1
This is the best price I found for these . My stores locally sell individually for much more . This was a good value .	1
This product is what it is advertised as . Along with the Genie Disposal System it keeps the litter odors down . I do feel that the refills are somewhat pricey . They also claim that you can go two weeks without needed to get rid of the bag , but I have found this not to be true . I only have one cat and he can fill up a bag in one week . If you have more than one cat , you may have to change it twice a week . I will continue to use this , but hope someone will come up with a generic and cheaper refill .	1
This product completely eliminates the odor of cat waste . Another consumer used it with her dog and I think I will give it a try especially in the summer time when the odor can become intense and the garbage men will remove plastic bags from the trash if they know animal waste is in the bin .	1
I love the litter genie it rocks ! no smell no mess easy to dispose of , , , this should have been invented years ago . Although these bags cost a little more they are worth it .	1
I have four cats so having the refill cartridge is great . I love this litter system and I would recommend the Litter Genie to anyone !	1
Well , I love my Genie . It 's the best purchase I 've made in years . Scoop , discard , and empty every two weeks . I live in an apartment on the third floor so my idea of hauling car poo down the stairs every day is not at the top of my list . Anyway , these refills for Genie are a great buy . Compared to what I have paid retail they are a steal . If you 've never used the Genie , then try it . Then , order this deluxe package at a great price .	1
They save us lots of money , if we were to buy these at Petco we would have to pay $ 3 more for each filter . We order these all the time now !	1
WOW ! I could kiss the person who invented this product . Especially with the advent of & # 34 ; no more plastic bags & # 34 ; being given out in the markets where I live . These cartridges are sooooo easy to use ! And , I figured out that when the litter starts to get up towards the top , I can open the bottom of the unit that holds this cartridge and lightly press down on the bag and I 'll get at least 2-3 more days use out of each bag . GREAT Invention ! ! !	1
These are the best items for cutting down on odors etc . from your cat 's litter box . Very easy to use and last a long time . I would highly recommend this to all cat lovers .	1
Love the litter genie and this is the way to go . Very afforable in large quanties like this and your gon na use that many in the end anyways . Great seller A ++++ Great packing , quick shipping , affordable ! Thanks	1
This is the way to go ... .along with the Litter Genie ... I realize that they are somewhat pricey , but , worth every penny . I read where some people used regular plastic bags , but that seems to take away from the whole idea of this wonderful product . The convenience alone makes this one of my favorite things ... Even the cat knows that I am happier about & # 34 ; potty clean time & # 34 ; .	1
After doing much researching for this type of product I found this to be the most economical of all . It works perfectly with my Genie and it is less costly than buying the Genie Refills .	1
what more can you ask for ? I ca n't find these anywhere except target and they cost more and I have to go out in the hot sun and use my gas to get there . It was nice , cheap fast and I even used the box they came in to send my granddaughters school clothes a win win situation . Love my amazon !	1
I received these before I even received my Litter Genie . Good item ... do n't know what else to say . I wish I would have received it with my Litter Genie .	1
Fit my litter genie well , and got a good price for so many refills . Cheaper than buying at the pet store .	1
I have 3 cats and so this group of 6 is an amazing deal ! Thanks for offering this great price too !	1
Our local store has 2 pack refills that cost the same as the genie so I was thrilled at the price and amount ! With 2 cats we fill a genie bag a week !	1
So glad they had it right with the Litter Genie I purchased - which the local store did NOT have currently in supply !	1
The litter genie is a great little system for keeping cat litter contained . Before I was scooping into plastic grocery bags and throwing everything out in the trash , but the smell was awful . The litter genie keeps everything contained and really does remove the odor . This refill pack is cheap and the bags are durable . I 've had no problems with rips or tears . The refills last a decent amount of time , and I 'm scooping into them daily . Recommended product .	1
Love my genie and this cartridge is a good buy .	1
I love it for real . It is so much better than the litter locker I used before . It uses less of the cartridge . The unit is relatively inexpensive . The refills are about the same price but do last quite a bit longer .	1
We had to move our outside cat in for awhile after some unfortunate events necessitated the confinement ... he does n't mind using a box but we 're not keen on the odors . This product works really well with the Litter Genie and Amazon has it at decent prices and of course convenient and value added .	1
I think this genie is awesome . Only have to empty bags every couple of weeks . Of course , this depends on how much plastic you pull down into the pail . Neat and easy to use to enclose scooped litter . Once you have changed the bags it does not seem so complicated . Oh.yes , I use the shears to clip the full bag and not the cutter ( easier ) . Very good tutorial on internet . We have 2 for 2 cats . The genie is plastic and is not very expensive but I feel it is well worth the purchase .	1
This set-up for the genie is the easiest way to clean a litter box and not have to worry about getting your hands dirt .	1
Amazon has a an excellent price for these refills , when I purchased the Genie product I ordered the refills at the same time and paid thru the nose for them . This product is excellent and kudos to the merchant for offering this product at a fair price .	1
I love , love my Litter Genie . Yes , it has some miner flaws but overall it is a great idea . These refills were actually a great price when I found them on Amazon . It did take me a few minutes to figure out how to open them for the Litter Genie when I needed to replace it . I definitely felt a little embarrassed after that !	1
The litter genie is a must have for any cat owner . I have 5 cats in the house with 2 litter genies . I change the bag once a week and I have NO litter odor anymore ! ! Wonderful ! I have it set up to auto send one refill a month and it works perfectly . Each genie needs refilled every other month so the bags last a long time ( especially cleaning up after five cats ) .	1
The price is reasonable and the plastic does contain cat litter smells very nicely . The refill is easy to load .	1
There 's nothing compared to these refills . They really do work ... .no smell what so ever . I even use them for my dogs poo ... .no more smells in the litter genie outside . I Love This Product ! ! ! !	1
The entire Genie system is the best for emptying a litter box . There is absolutely no odor with this system no matter how long the waste stays in the bag .	1
This works as stated and is very convient . It is a bit pricey compared to using left over grocery bags , but those have holes in them sometimes and make a mess . This keeps the stinky contained until you dump it . Then there is some odor . I dump twice a week . I have two cats . Overall , a great product that seems to last as long as it says !	1
great deal	1
I used to use plastic grocery bags which I then had to cart to the garage trash can each time . I can use the Litter Genie for at least a week ( 1 cat ) before emptying it with no stink . Also , previously the garage can would then smell like cat pee thus making the garage smell like it whenever you opened the can . Do n't have to worry about that anymore . I 'm sure the garbage man is happier too .	1
These work fine but do seem to be a little inconsistent as to how long they last . It seems that some rolls may be longer than others . Our cats go the same amount , and we change the box the same amount , so that 's the only thing I can think of . Overall happy with the product though .	1
This refill pack is a great buy economically . As for the product , the Litter Genie the cat 's meow . I hope to never be without it .	1
I have three cats and one foster cat . One cat is prissy and wo n't use a dirty litter box . This is a life-saver and there is no odor in my house .	1
I have been using my Litter Genie for a few months now . Unlike bags from the store or newspaper , I like how I do n't have to worry about holes leaking a trail of cat litter when I put it in the trash . I withheld the 5th star because of the lack of worded instructions . Until you get used to changing the cartridge , the pictures showing you how to do it are n't very helpful . They are also expensive .	1
I wish they were cheaper but I ca n't have the Litter Genie without them . So far litter disposal has been made easier	1
I like using the Litter Genie over my old method of scooping into multiple grocery bags , which often have holes or tears . I can go almost 2 weeks of scooping litter into the genie before having to change out the bag . However , since I have 2 cats , some weeks I can fill up the genie quickly.A word of caution on ordering these refills , make sure and check the per item price vs. the 3-pack . Today , I noticed the per item price was 6.99 each , and the 3-pack was $ 24 , so you could save $ 3 by ordering them individually !	1
This cartridge fits the Genie pail perfectly , as it should . The plastic is strong , in that it does n't tear , rip or break , which is important for obvious reasons . One cartridge is supposed to last 2 months per normal cat . My cat has kidney failure , so she urinates more than most . One cartridge lasted me 1 1/2 months . I like how you can tie the beginning knot with very little extra plastic at the end . This allows for less waste . I also do n't tie the open end once the unit is full . I cut the end , and place the whole thing in a grocery sack , tie the handles and toss it away . This allows for less wasted plastic . If you are unsure how this unit works , check out my reviews . I have made a video review of theLitter Genie Cat Litter Disposal Odor Free Pail Systemunit , with complete instructions on how it works.I like the cartridge , it 's easy to set up and the plastic is strong . However , the price is pretty high . I just paid 9.99 at the local Petco here in town , and at the time of this review , it is 7.49 on Amazon . That 's pretty steep for something that only lasts a couple months . I almost gave it a 4 because of the price , however , because the cartridge performs so well , I left it at a 5 .	1
These bags are awesome -- totally control the odor and are a great strength for used litter . No complaints here ! Only thing I wish is that these were pre-cut and sealed . Meaning , I 'd love them to be more like the plastic bags you use when you get vegetables at the grocery store -- they are sealed on the bottom and pre-perforated . Instead , these bags you cut yourself on the cutter installed in the unit and then tie them yourself . The litte genie is the same size so not sure why they could n't be pre-cut/pre-sealed .	1
The best product ! No more collecting bags from the grocery store ! One refill lasts us at least 6 weeks , and that 's with 2 cats !	1
I enjoy the ease of using this product . If you need this type of product you should have something that is so simple to instaqll .	1
Even though they tell you how it will last a longer time . I have figured out it you can make it last longer . I clean out litter box every other day . And this helps me to keep it longer than it says . I love this product because of no smell getting out ! ! ! Holds a lot of # # # # # # ! ! ! ! ! !	1
it really reduces the smell-a LOT ! Easy to install , does n't last as long as I wished , but I still use it anyway .	1
It serves it 's purpose . I 'd like it better if the cases were a bit easier to open - I have arthritis in my hands and they are sometimes very difficult to open . It would also be nice if they came pre-closed at the bottom , to save an extra step when replacing the cartridge .	1
I have two of these in my house and it makes having a cat a lot easier ... .keeps the smell out and so convenient ... no running to the garbage can ever day . Great invention ! Love it ! This is just the refill ... .I have the Disposal System that this fits into . Two of them and they are not expensive at all . Great time savers . Check it out !	1
I do like the litter genie system , but definitely shop around for a good price . The refills I can sometimes get abut $ 5- $ 6 each pending quantity and place I buy them at .	1
It is easy to use and change the cartridge . I absolutely would not be without it . Does a GREAT job ! ! !	1
I really love the kitty genie , it saves so much time and really cut down the smell to almost nothing . I was scared that it would not because of a couple of reviews that I read but do n't believe everything you read was what my granddad told me . For sure it does not stop it entirely only a fool would believe that but I could hardly smell it at all . On that note you will have to see for yourself but I can say I love it !	1
I love the convenience of these liners and especially like the auto ship . Easy to load into the Litter Genie , tie and dispose .	1
I used to dump the dirty cat litter in a bag and then throw it out when it got full . I 'm in a wheelchair , so I ca n't get my trash to the dumpster every day . That litter smelled awful and the bag was heavy ! I bought the litter genie and I love it ! It 's so easy to use ! The refill fits right in and lasts a while . You just pull the bag down and tie the end . I have to use the refill more often because I have 2 large cats & 2 litter boxes , but for the average user the refill should last a long time . When you 're through with one refill , just throw it away and put the next one in .	1
Tried making do with other methods but came back for the great odor control and convenience . Only problem is dont really know when I 'm at the end of the roll . This will cause it to fall with all the weight of the litter . I have it as a convenience for my cat sitter to scoop out every day without having to take it out to the trash outside every time . If she had to take it out every time she might not scoop ! Unfortunately , I found liner had fallen when I came back from a trip , but at least she scooped ! Easy to wash out and start again clean and fresh .	1
I bought a litter genie when I moved into a much smaller apartment last year . The litter genie is amazing . I have two cats & clean the box every day . It takes about 12-14 days to fill the genie . A refill last about 2 months . A great investment . Absolutely no smell . I wish I would have known about litter genie sooner .	1
Wish the bags had some sort of marking on them so you know where to cut it so you do n't end up with an unusable short end on the roll .	1
Of course this works great with the system , but you really need to be careful when you open and pull the plastic & # 34 ; sheeting & # 34 ; from the cartridge . I pulled it out wrong but was able to salvage and use it.That is the only downside of this product and I will be extra careful when I open the new one .	1
Works really well with the box to make cleaning up after my cat much easier ! Would buy again . ( filler word )	1
I bought these Litter Genie refills on Amazon since they 're a bit cheaper than at my local store . The Litter Genie is so much better than scooping into a regular bag , since I live in an apartment and going to the dumpster every day is a hassle . These are great !	1
Smells nice , easy , clean . SUGGESTION : to tie the bottom , I like to take two corners and tie them really tightly into a knot , sort of like you might do with your kitchen garbage bag if it does n't come with a drawstring . Then , when the bag is full , I tie the top the same way and tote it to the outside trash.This Genie system seriously cuts down my trips to the outside can , and keeps the used and dumped litter smelling fresh while it awaits its turn to go outside.For my two cats who potty often , the bag needs to be changed every 4 days , but that 's still more convenient than me picking , tying a new bag , and toting it outside 4 times a day .	1
I ca n't imagine litter removal without this product ! I have two cats and they & # 34 ; produce & # 34 ; so much ... I 'm constantly scooping.The cartridges seem to last forever and hold so much of the icky stuff . I keep thinking I 'm going to have to replace the cartridge but then another bin full gets taken away and there 's more plastic in the refill.One cartridge + 2 cats = 2 months and still & # 34 ; going & # 34 ; ! Beats emptying my trash everyday and using a hole-y grocery bag .	1
While I could do with a smaller price tag you are paying for convenience here . This in conjunction with the litter genie works magic . No more litter smells in my apartment !	1
THE LITTER GENIE IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT I LOVE IT I ALWAYS BUY EXTRA CARTRIDGES SO IAM NEVER WITH OUT ANY	1
These things would rate 5 stars if they were cheaper . I like how well they work . The tied ends never leak and the walls never break , which would make an awful mess as you move them out of the house . The system contains odors well enough . I am a happy user ( for one cat nearing adult size ) .	1
I love the litter genie ... it Effectively eliminates litter box odors and hold at least 10 days of scooping ... .before it is time to use a new vast .	1
I fell in love with Litter Genie after using it the first time . It is a relatively inexpensive litter waste disposal system that REALLY works . The people at Litter Genie thought of everything . They make the process of cleaning your litter box easy . If you have a Litter Genie , you need the refills . Perfect packaging , arrived on time and delivered to my front door . What more could a human/cat want ? This should last me a few months since I have one cat . Thank you .	1
The Litter Genie pale is actually what does the job , but this is good so I do n't have to get plastic bags at the grocery store anymore .	1
I love this litter disposal system ! This site is the best place to obtain the replaceable cartridge ... and it is the best price that I 've found to date .	1
Easy to setup - works well and odors kept at bay until it 's time to reset the bag . Purchasing this every month or 2 with amazon subscribe and save makes litter duty a piece of cake . Note : This works best with the heavier clumping litter than non-clumping feline pine - it needs the little extra weight to fall down the genie chute ... if you must use the feline pine then the genie does n't work so good .	1
I had been using litter Robot automatic litter boxes but my current living situation has no room for them so I had to go manual . The Litter Genie does do a good job at odor reduced litter storage.My only real gripe is that it is fairly expensive for what is in effect 50 cents worth of plastic bag in a 50 cent holder ... Ahh the price of laziness ...	1
These are used in the Litter Genie which makes disposal of litter box waste significantly easier than it would be otherwise .	1
This system is the best for keeping litter odor away and keeping our weight room fresh and clean smelling . these refills are great . they last a long time . and are so easy to use .	1
I like litter genie because the container is smaller , but diaper genie bags last longer ... toss up but right now we are using the litter genie . Either is a great way to dispose of kitty waste .	1
Got to have them if you have the litter Genie . The system really work if you have one cat . It 's probably still works with two . I travel a lot and my pets sitters use it .	1
They fit my Litter Genie like they are supposed to and work just perfectly . I could not stand to be without my Litter Genie and the refills .	1
I am asked to rate this every single month and am tired of it but Amazon has this on autopilot . They work fine .	1
So far , I 'm still on the original refill that came with my system , but from what I 've seen , it 's gon na work great and I love having the extras on hand .	1
Cleaning the cat box , and finding a non smelly location is not easy . Purchased the Genie system , and wish I would have done so sooner . Love it . So easy to use , and hides the smell . Very nice , especially when you have 2 kitties . No smell in the house . I do recommend this .	1
Let me first state that I am thoroughly devoted to using my litter locker - it takes all of the yick factor , making the cleanup of a litter box far less tedious and messy . Because of this , I purchased this 12-pack . The price is right and I have not found a single fault with the items .	1
This makes cleaning the litter box so much easier and convenient . The refills are easy to insert into the Genie and very easy to empty the old refill . I would recommend the Genie and the refills to everyone with a cat or kitten .	1
I do n't know how anyone w/a cat who uses a cat box and clumping litter can live w/out these products ! There 's never an odor in my house and the disposal and changing out the cartridges is easy and quick .	1
I bought a litter genie a few months ago and went to Target for another refill , only to find them at the price I paid for the entire system ! After checking Amazon and noticing that I could get the same exact ones for half the cost , I ordered a couple ! Such a ripoff in store , but the litter genie makes it easier to clean the cat box more often and has made my cat less picky about throwing litter around ! Totally recommend the litter genie system , DEFINITELY recommend ordering your refills here !	1
It was worth it to me for the added convenience of this product to pay the regular price , and with the 12-pack even better . Each refill lasts me almost 2 months ( with 2 cats ) so this should keep kitties happy for the next 1.5-2 years .	1
I love the Litter Genie ! I really do ! It 's a life-saver . These bags have great quality control . I 've never had any issues with the bags . However , the price of these is absolutely ridiculous . I can buy an entire new Litter Genie for cheaper ! I have two litter Genie 's . I try to only buy the 3-pack refill every once in a while , but I wish they 'd increase the price for the actual Genie rather than the replacement refills .	1
Right now we do n't have a better system in place so this works . The refills are fine , they 're just like what you get with the Genie itself . It 's better to buy in bulk , you get a better price that way.The Genie ( which is a different review ) could probably use some tweaking . As far as refills go though , these are fine . They last a fair amount of time , they tend to not break , and they are easy to use.If you have more than two cats , I 'd make sure to have at least one refill on standby . While you get warning when it 's about full , it 's nice to not have to worry about getting another one immediately .	1
This is a great item to use to contain used cat litter . I had the container and was looking for an economical way to get the refills . Getting three at one time is a help to stretch the budget . Easy to use . It holds soiled litter from two older kittens and lasts about three weeks before needing a new refill . This may vary depending on the number of cats you may have . I like being able to collect the used litter in the container . Tie it up and then throw away . The large holder that these refills use keeps odor down to a minimum . Makes it easy to clean the litter box at different hours of the day because the discreet canister can sit close to the litter box area so I can grab it whenever . I use environmentally friendly litter which is light . I ca n't speak to how heavier clay litter would affect the weight of the plastic . I also found it is much less expensive to get it on Amazon than it is in specialty pet stores or retail shops	1
It works . It is easy to set up and replace . It does what you would expect it to do . For what you pay , I just expected it to last a little longer .	1
I bought my genie & replacement a few weeks ago & I 'm still on my first cartridge & I clean my cat 's litter everyday , sometimes twice a day . It works great !	1
We love the Litter Genie and having this product on subscription both saves money and insures that we do n't run out . We have three cats and the bags last longer than advertised . This is probably because we only feed high quality dry food , so there is less & # 34 ; waste & # 34 ; to scoop .	1
I have been using this for over a year now . I subscribe and save on it . before that I was buying them from target . Works like a diaper pail . only bad thing is there is no warning that the bag is about to run out . so sometimes when the plastic finishes the plastic and the the cat litter fall loose inside the litter genie . Aside from that it contains the smell .	1
Yeah , it 's more expensive than using plastic bags , but some things are just worth it . Litter genie makes it easy and there is no smell . These cartridges are very easy to install and the plastic is very durable . We get it so full that it 's quite heavy but never have concerns about stretching or tearing . The trash can is no longer smelly while the bag sits in there until trash day .	1
one of the best inventions was the litter genie ! these refills are durable & last for a very long time ! ! 14 feet of a long time	1
While I have n't had to change out the Cartridge yet , I really love this product . Absolutely NO SMELL has been what friends have been saying when they see my kitty 's litter box . Right next to it sits the bucket that these bags sit in . In fact , my housekeeper asked if I wanted her to setup ( activate ) the system ? I opened the lid and showed her that the pail was about half full . Her immediate reaction : Where did you get it and how much did you pay ? I think she has already ordered one ! With just one kitty , I probably wo n't need more refills for awhile . After one month , I 've only used two of the five bags in my original cartridge that came with the pail system and purchased 3 of these refills . I 'm a believer !	1
Litter Genie or Litter Genius . Seriously a great idea and ca n't believe I did n't think of this myself . It 's the same concept as a diaper genie and works just as well . I used to have a mess of a trash can constantly dumping litter into it . Yucky and I felt like I could n't let guests into my guest bathroom for that reason . These bags fit perfectly into the Litter Genie with a wide enough mouth to minimize spills outside of the Genie . While the refills are a little pricey , they have allowed me to regain control over my guest bathroom and keep everything tidy , smell-free and presentable and you ca n't put a price on that .	1
I love my Litter Genie Plus which uses the refills . No kitty poop odor and I can get 4 weeks worth with one refill . They work great . Very reasonable price .	1
I love cats . I love their mushy little faces and furry kisses . I love their silly antics and goofy peculiarities . What I do n't love is cleaning 10 litter boxes in 5 rooms and that does n't include the spare bedroom litter box for my grand kitties when they visit . Before I got my litter genies I carried a plastic shoe box around with a scoop and did all the boxes . It was smelly and disgusting , not to mention unsanitary . The Litter genies are great but like any device that has disposable parts , it 's only as good as the bags used . These long , tube shaped bags are great . They are super strong and despite dropping one of them full of litter and cat crap , it did n't burst . I have 5 Litter Genies so I do n't have to carry them from room to room which makes cleaning litter boxes daily a breeze . If I could just get my cats to use the new lightweight litter , I 'd have it made in the shade !	1
arrived very quickley , I should be able to put as many or as little words as I please I should not be told to add more	1
Would like it better if it was cheaper but it get the job done . The only problem I faced was the feces can get stuck on the exposed trash linen when you open the top .	1
Bought these refills to have on hand . I do n't think we could ever go back to using any other system . Litter genie is awesome !	1
I have 5 cats and have litter boxes all over . Since we have a two story house it is double the amount for each cat . It is so important to prevent accidents from cats by having a litter box for each one on each floor and make sure they are clean ! The Chinchilla Persian cat is so clean that they sometimes wo n't use the litter box if another cat has used it . I have a hidden from view litter box in my dining room ... litter robot ... ..it sounds gross but you would never know it is there . The litter genie is next to it an has no odor emitting from it either . I love my cats but do n't want my house to smell like their litter box ! ! ! ! !	1
The package of three refills is a much better deal than buying individually . These work great with my litter Genie .	1
It 's perfect for 1 or 2 cats , I have 4 cats and I end up scooping into a garbage bag most of the time . Too much to put into the Genie at one time .	1
These are a bargain compared to other places , including the pet stores I go to . Very happy with them and will be ordering more .	1
The refill bags are a little expensive $ 50 for 6 refill units but they do actually work . I have the entire unit of the Litter Genie and these refill bags and I was shocked that they did eliminate the odor of cat waste .	1
So far its been good . Having a separate can to lock out the smell I do n't understand how such cuteness can produce is well worth its money . The replacement bag goes in easily . The longer I have it , I 'll update on durability of this product ( the bags specifically )	1
Works great , very low odor and easy to use . But I wish it was easier to install into the litter genie because of my arthritis , and often if I travel I have to change it when I come home because my mother ca n't figure out how to open it .	1
Easy system ; bing/bang/boom it 's done ! And the plastic bag is strong ... holds a lot ! And lasts quite a while ... .for one cat anyway .	1
Very happy with theses refills . They are easy to use and last quite a while . My biggest beef is that they are n't biodegradable .	1
I like my litter genie . It is more expensive than a bucket and plastic bag , but this definitely keeps the smell confined . I have the pail and plastic bag set up in my bath ; and the Genie in my laundry room , which is also a main entrance to the house since it is off my garage . There is no odor in my laundry room .	1
I really like this product & the 3-pack is a good value for me . The Litter Genie works awesome . I 'm also trying the auto-ship .	1
excellent ideal put to everyday use . this is genius , and very efficient . used exclusively for little genie cat litter disposal system.very easy to install .	1
A good system for litter	1
The Litter Genie is an amazing invention . It gave me my clean-smelling house back . Highly recommend this product line , which includes this 12 pack refill .	1
I love my Litter Genie ! I really do n't know what I 'd do without it . After running out of my last refill right before heading on vacation ( had to have the cat sitter use grocery bags ) , I like having multiple refills on hand so I never run out . I get maybe 1.5-2 months out of each refill . I wish they were a little bit cheaper because it 's just plastic , but am willing to pay for the convenience .	1
Was purchasing refills at my local pet store but was getting pricey . These are great you get three for the price of two !	1
I ordered an extra refill when we ordered our Genie . They last so long , I have n't had to open the replacement yet . We have two large cats and I expected to have to empty the bag more often , but I do n't . The odor is contained much better than I expected . Great product and great price .	1
We should have purchased a genie a long time ago.We have 5 cats altogether now.A lot of scooping because of the frequent P_ _ ping . LOL.Would buy more from Amazon . Much cheaper than Petco !	1
i recieved my auto shippment but i am not done with my 1st on i bought at pet co but love it	1
If you have litter boxes , get a Litter Genie immediately ! What a miracle invention ! We have two indoor cats . I purchased a refill for my Litter genie as soon as I figured out how wonderful it is . It 's more than two months later and I have n't had to open the refill , yet ! This is with emptying the genie once a week . Ca n't say enough about this - no smell , easy to empty , it 's great !	1
This litter genie system has worked wonders for our household . Ever since we adopted our two cats we have had the litter genie . It makes cleaning the litter box so easy every day . I think that everyone who has to clean out a litter box should own one of these . I never want to know what is like to do it the caveman way . Great product and the Cartridges last a really long time ! We have had ours for months - we empty it once per week - but still have not had to change out the cartridge . This was a fantastic investment .	1
The Litter Genie is a great product and the refills are just as easy to use as the product itself ! Definitely recommended .	1
This seems to be a good system so be a stink free system so far . My cats do n't seem to have a problem with it .	1
The plastic used in this product is amazing . There is absolutely no odor coming from the unit or the tied up bags as I take them to the trash . They are pricey , but the elimination of odor in my 2-cat litter box room is priceless .	1
These refills are pricey , no question , but for me the convenience is worth it . They contain the smell of the used litter very well . I use duct tape to secure the bag closed instead of tying a knot like the directions say - it wastes less of the bag . They really do not last as long as the manufacture says they do , I find myself needing to change the refill more often than they would have you believe .	1
Great buy . I HATE driving to the pet store and I really like my litter genie . This came in nothing flat and I got it by mail sooner than I could have worked myself up driving to the pet store . I like having the extras on hand too.Will be ordering again .	1
I have two Litter Genie 's and like the way they are designed to dispose of litter quickly , easily and without unpleasant smells . The 3-Pack is a bit more expensive than plastic grocery bags but the convenience , the strength of the plastic , the ease of handling and the fact that there are no unsightly litter bags in sight is , to me , worth the price .	1
Great price for the refills . They last a long time any ways . Great price to stock up , and what could be easier than them coming to your door	1
wish I had purchased the litter Genie long ago . really is a life saver . refills are great to have . no more using grocery bags	1
I have one cat who is certifiably insane for toys . Large boxes ? He jumps in them and they are fortresses of peeking and mad shuffling . Small boxes ? They are hockey pucks on the kitchen floor . Little paper balls , those plastic things you pull off of milk caps , my shoelaces , you name it , Alex the Cat will lunge for it , be fascinated by it , and will be absorbed by it , instantly , comically.Alex the Cat , when introduced to this toy , just looked at me . It was a look that made me feel like Joe Pesci had just slapped me . I 've tried marinating the thing in good catnip , and even then , Alex , Bella , and Smootchy would n't acknowledge it.I 'll just stop right here . Do n't buy this . Your cats will lose respect for you .	-1
You never know with cat toys what they 'll love and what they 'll turn their nose up and walk away . My Starla ( she 's nine ) loves loves loves the toy mice , but ca n't be bothered with the busy balls ( had another cat years ago who loved them to death ) . She likes the catnip toys for the most part , but at times ca n't be bothered with some of them . *shrugs*I have something similar to this , but larger with the feathers attached at the top and not on a string . She kind of gives it a nod of attention , but otherwise it gather dust . The feather on a string with this toy interested me enough to try it , but Starla only gave the string a bit of interest and then walked away and immersed herself with a toy mouse or too . I think this toy might be better suited to a kitten based on its size , but I would n't want to leave a very small kitten alone with it until you 're comfortable . As another reviewer noted , there might be a choking hazard , but I 'm not around small kittens these days to be enough of a judge.Starla 's # 1 favorite toy ? The 24 & # 34 ; tall stuffed Mountain Lion with the very long , very bushy tail - a tail that 's just made for wrestling .	-1
This is an excellent toy if you have a cat who 'll just bat at the feathers . Unfortunately , I do n't . Heather likes to eat feathers whole and while this mechanism is good it 's not good enough to foil a Siamese like I had hoped . She just holds the toy in place and tries to deep throat the feather on the top.Definitely use this for supervised play and heed the instructions on the cover to keep out of the reach of children . Aside from the feather , there are small bits children can swallow.Rebecca Kyle , November 2013	-1
My two male 17 month-old cats will play with just about anything - a kitchen sponge , a teabag , a pen . Surprisingly , they are completely uninterested in theSmartyKat WobbleBobble Rocking Feather Cat Toy . Neither the ribbons nor the feathers caught their attention , even while they watched me rock it with my toe . My senior cat sniffed it and wandered off.My suggestion would be to put a small sack of catnip in the toy to attract cats . When they batted at it to get to the catnip , the ribbons and feather might keep their attention.All three cats enjoy playing withCat Dancer 301 Cat Charmer Interactive Cat Toy , but that requires a human to wave it around to keep them occupied for long .	-1
The blurb that comes with this reads : '' Satisfies your cat 's need for independence . Place our WobbleBobble rocking feather toy on the floor and watch your cat swing and swat at the dangling feather . The weighted base keeps the toy in motion , causing the feather to flutter and your cat to swoon . A bell inside teases your cat for added stimulation . `` None of that proved to be true with my swinging and swatting toy-happy felines . Over the course of three days , I 've tried WobbleBobble on carpet , on wood and on tile and here 's what happened on all three : Give it a nudge with a human hand or toe and it rights itself instantly without a wobble or sound . The feather that clings to the top of the toy , if it flutters at all , does so in the blink of an eye . The bell inside the toy can be heard only if I pick up the toy and give it a shaking , but the sound that comes from the base when I do that is n't a `` ding , '' It 's more like that of a loose paper clip.I 've placed this in various spots in the cats ' usual hangouts , as it 's not built for being carried around in feline mouths or swatted into a more preferred location . No response . WobbleBobble now seems to be firmly set on `` Ignore ! '' Sometimes cats need to live with something for awhile before they show interest . I do n't think that 's the case here , but if it turns out I 'm wrong about that , I 'll come back here for a re-do of this review .	-1
I 've owned other SmartyKat products for my two cats . They 've always loved them . The WobbleBobble , however , is clearly a miss . After fighting to get it out of the packaging - thick packaging tape was wrapped around the cardboard , covering the twist ties that had to be untwisted - I set the WobbleBobble on the floor . Both cats immediately ran over , batted it , and then walked away . After a day , I wondered if maybe they just did n't like the noise it made on the wood flooring , so I moved it to the carpeted living room . Neither one have touched it after two days.SmartyKat 's laser pointer has been a solid addition to their play toys for two years . They also adore their pullback mouse , their scratch pads/boxes , and the bouncy mouse that I attached to their cat tree . It 's clearly not SmartyKat toys that do n't appeal to them , there 's just something about WobbleBobble that they just do n't enjoy .	-1
My dog loves these and has been eating them for years . It took a while to realize what was causing him to have terrible diarrhea ... and removing all possible other causes , it was the Pedigree Marrobone that was making him sick.I stopped immediately , yet he still had terrible diarrhea for about about 6-8 more hours.Since then , no problems whatsoever.So definitely was the BAD BATCH I RECEIVED .	-1
bad idea to try these instead of usual favorite treats . i dunno if sensitivity or something in there made her sick . i see no where on package WHERE these are made ! ! bad choice . wonder about all the positive reviews .	-1
When the distributor refuses to prove where their product is made , that should be a big red flag -- probably China ! Distributors of these products from China will do anything to avoid letting you know the truth . Do n't poison your dog with these dangerous treats . AND , when it says MADE FOR so and so , that 's another big flag that it is NOT made in the USA . Think about it , companies who truly make their dog and cat treats in the USA are very proud of that and it 's obviously stated on the bag so customers can not miss it .	-1
I gave two small pieces of this to my 5 year old yorkie pom mix . That evening she had a seizure . It was horrible . She had never had one before that we have seen . We took her to the emergency clinic and all bloodwork came back good . Then I read about seizures and one of the main causes is toxins which can include food . This was the only different type food she had that day . I looked on the FDA website and it is not just jerky made in China . It could be made in the USA but who knows where the chicken came from . With that information we decided not to give her any more of this dog treat .	-1
ok for the first 15 bags , but ca n't buy new bags on roller , so the new ones do n't fit in the dispenser .	-1
I ordered this dispenser because it is advertised with the metal clip . I received another version with a velcro clip . This product is incorrectly advertised and if you want this dispenser product with velcro it is much cheaper if you buy from another seller . I want to return for a refund .	-1
I have used a variety of poop bags , especially whatever is on sale or whatever the pet store has when I run out . I bought these when I ran out once . The scent is nauseating . I am not sure how anyone would describe it as pleasant . And the bags are such a poor quality that I ended up wasting half the bags because they would rip as I was trying to tear them from the roll . And those that did n't rip , usually ended up with a hole in the bottom along the tear line so if you had any loose stools , they would leak . I will never buy these again , regardless of them being good for the environment .	-1
This product broke just this week . I 'm not even sure what it struck , but it basically shattered at the threads . At least it was cheap and easily replaced .	-1
Did n't do anything for my dog 's kidney levels . Also , all the studies that support this product are funded/published by the manufacturer ... not science I would put my faith in . The one study I found by an independent source ( a zoo that used this for large cats ) , found that this product did not work .	-1
I also received the 90 capsules with no indication if they contain the same amount of ingredient as the 60 . I thought by law the net weight had to be told at least on the container . The extra charge for the 90 is outrageous if it does not contain 1.5 times as much as the 60 capsule bottle . And Amazon should make all this clear if they are going to carry the 60 and the 90 size .	-1
Does n't work . Not sure that I buy the whole deal about some pets ' urine being undetectable . Should pick up other stains as well , and I have yet to have anything illuminate under this light . Did help me fine a rubber earring backing that I dropped on a shag rug though ... so not a complete waste of money .	-1
I understand that for a small percentage of dogs this light will not work . But I have two dogs , and it did not work for either of them . A fluke of nature ? They both have occasional accidents in the basements . I clean the best I can , but it 's usually never enough . I used this light on a door mat my dog had peed on before I threw it in the wash , and nothing showed up . For me , this was completely worthless .	-1
Did not work for me perhaps just my dog but sent it back for refund do n't really recommend this product	-1
This did not show pet urine stains at all ... Period . Returned it for a better product which immediately showed the stains I was looking for . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I have two recent rescues who are still acclimating to their new environment , and mess in the house occasionally . I found that with this light , it really only worked if the urine was still damp , in which case , I can find it just as easily walking across the floor barefoot ...	-1
This black light was a total waste of money . I was not able to make out anything on my carpeting with this light .	-1
This product would be practical if it were made better . The battery compartment is not user-friendly . I did break the battery compartment trying to get the battery in so I returned the product .	-1
This light did not work AT ALL . I had 2 dogs and a cat at that time and none of their markings showed !	-1
I searched high and low for a product that seemed to have the best reviews , and I 'm not sure why ... but using this actually made the smell worse . I purchased 3 bottles , and will be returning 2 since I have no use for them now . I followed the directions to a & # 34 ; T & # 34 ; , I do n't know how this happened . My entire house now wreaks of cat urine , when originally it was only one room that had a slight smell . I 'm running air purifiers 24/7 , and still I ca n't get the smell to dissipate . I 'm very disappointed , I was hoping this was the miracle I needed to banish the smell for good .	-1
Not for a Yorkie . This is a homemade outfit . Not to keep any dog secure . It is in its packaging , and not even worthy of giving to a shelter . What should I do with it ? Cute.. But , not a secure method of leash/ collar for any pup or doggie.I rate negative . A first time dog owner would not know any different , you should be ashamed .	-1
Purchased this to carry around my maltipoo puppy ( under 2 lbs ) . No dice . Really frumpy and when I opened the package , a very strong chemical smell filled the space . The smell would probably wash out but the bag is way too big for my little puppy . Might work for larger dogs though if you can get beyond the frump factor .	-1
When I received this item , I attached it to my dog 's leash with the included carabiner clip . Two days later , it had fallen off during a long walk and was gone for good . I do n't know if the clip ( which is flimsy and very low quality construction ) opened or if the loop on the bag where it was attached gave way , but either way , I rest my case . This is a piece of junk .	-1
This is not a & # 34 ; carry-all & # 34 ; . Too small for enough treats , and the outer mesh pocket is too small to hold a tennis ball ; ok maybe you can force it in , but then no room for the crushed treat compartment . The carabiner attachment is useless for a treat bag that has to be accessed . The pull string throttling closure makes access awkward ; ok maybe you just want to keep the treats from spilling and not access them . Design for wannabe , but not reality .	-1
The look is nice , which is partly why I chose it ... and the 2-ways of attaching to your pants . Also like the netting for the ball to allow air drying when slobbery.The problems are : 1. ball has to be 'worked ' into the pouch using both hands and making sure treat opening is closed when full of treats ... even with a rubber ball that squishes to be manipulated a bit . 2 . Treat bag has 2nd pouch , when reaching in with 1 hand while training , holding leash with other , I often slip my fingers into the wrong section causing a delay in the treat reward ... annoying.If I had to choose again , I would have chose the simpler design .	-1
I know this is a toothbrush for kittens , but I found it to be just a little too small . Also , it 's awkward to `` wear '' it on you finger , I had a hard time angling it to get it in my cat 's mouth , and ended up just holding it . It also felt like the bristles were a little bit too stiff.The toothpaste comes in a ketchup-like packet that gets messy very easily .	-1
The bristles are very stiff and it would hurt my cats delicate little gums if I used it on their teeth ( I tried it on my own teeth ) . The rest of this brush is stiff plastic and the part you slip your finger through pinches the top of the finger . It 's also very awkward to hold and maneuver while the cats try to escape . Not what I expected at all . I ordered three other toothbrushes from different sellers and one of them was designed for human baby mouths - this is the one with the softest bristles and I 'll probably end up using that one . The second best and second softest came in a Petrodex cat dental care kit . As to this particular tooth brush , I 'll probably end up throwing it away , unless I can find a different non-cat use for it - maybe cleaning jewelry , lol .	-1
If this is hard plastic , as I suspect it is , having bought similar items in the past , then the dogs ' oral mucosa gets pinched between your finger and the plastic , or between the two ends of the plastic ring . I hurt my poor dogs with a hard plastic finger brush in the past - never again ! Stick to a children 's toothbrush or a soft finger brush .	-1
This is very difficult to use . The bristles are very stiff , and seem to hurt my cat 's gums . I would not recommend anyone use it .	-1
I tried this leash because I thought it would make it easier to walk my Lab mix and beagle together , but I much prefer using two leashes held in one hand . The beagle tends to dawdle and cross behind me ; with two leashes , it 's easy to just duck under and spin around to keep from getting tangled . With this leash , he almost tripped me three times in a short walk because the leash got wrapped around my legs.It does seem sturdy and well made , so I suppose I 'd recommend it to people who already like using a dual leash .	-1
Smaller than I thought they 'd be . A bit too soft to get a lot of scrubbing done . This is n't orthodontics , this is algae and bacteria buildup ! The largest brush is about 1/2 & # 34 ; in diameter .	-1
The Shock must be not strong enough , i went to 100 and still no response or actions by him . im trying to break him from jumping on people , this collar is not worth the money . maybe a small breed but not a large young 10 month old male pup .	-1
One collar would not work or charge at all , sending back . Not planning on getting another one , seems cheaply made	-1
The tape is easy to apply but wo n't stick to my upholstery . My cat did have fun playing with the white paper tape I peeled off and crumpled up . Obviously from other reviews the tape does stick to some materials . My material is not fuzzy . It 's upholstery on a chair with a pattern woven in . Hope this helps !	-1
This is probably the worst product I have ever dealt with in my life . One of our cats likes to use a door frame as a scratching post . I did some research and decided to try Sticky Paws . Unfortunately , I ignored the negative reviews . Yes , it does go up fine and it does keep the cat from scratching . One negative ( before I get to the part that made me want to destroy all Sticky Paw products ) is that hair does get on the sticky surface , which that was to be expected . That was n't the part that bothered me but it is what led to what I call the Sticky Paws Fiasco.My daughter was having a birthday party and I wanted to take the tape off the door frame because cat hair was sticking to the tape . I began to remove it but it would only come off in microscopic bits . Even with that , it would leave a film behind if it did n't remove the paint . It was maddening . I tried all the tricks recommended and even a few more to remove the tape . It took my husband and me over 3 hours working in shifts to remove the film . We had to sand the door frame and repaint . I recommend just repainting where kitty scratches ( if that is possible ) instead of dealing with this demon tape . I ignored the negative reviews to my detriment .	-1
They say cats do n't like sticky things . They have n't met my cat . He loves sticky things . a lot . Nuff said .	-1
I did not like this at all . It does not stay on the chair and as soon as you touch it it falls off and becomes all bunched up . I went with two way tape and that seems to work the best just time consuming . Do not waste your money on this .	-1
This looked pretty tacky on the corner of my couches . Also , it did n't keep my cats from scratching the couch at all . Instead , they scratched the couch AND tried to eat the tape .	-1
I bought 2 rolls of this tape intending to use it on my counter tops and dining table ( which is covered with a tablecloth ) since it was advertised as usable for furniture and counter tops . Not so . First , a little thinking on my part would have helped . In order for this to work on counter tops , you 'd have to cover much of the counter with tape - which leaves no place for you to work or put things you do n't want stuck to the tape . But , more important than that is the fact that getting this tape off a counter top is an evil job . It sticks and to say it 's not easy to get it off is an understatement . DO NOT use this tape on anything that is n't fabric . Next , if you want to use it on fabric , bear in mind that it only works where you place it so if you do n't want the cats to sit on your sofa you wo n't be able to sit on it either . If you want to prevent them from scratching the sides of the sofa this would work well for that - and that 's all it works well for .	-1
tape is thin and perforated so short strips . Did not stick well and when you try to put it back it sticks to you .	-1
bought for my kitten , she jumps up on my desk , so I put one strip on the length and she tried to eat it , never stopped her for a second , so tried to take it off and it was so hard to take off , after rolling it for hours it came off with the wood covering , not a happy camper ! ! ! Be careful what you put the tape on and it comes in little squares about two inches.Just tried to take off my bedroom set and it destroyed all the wood ! ! ! So hard to take off that I gave up and what I could get off also took off all the top layer of the wood on my night stands and headboard . Very upset with this product because it said easy on easy off , it did n't say the truth about the easy to get off part and did n't say it would ruin your furniture .	-1
I 've had tap before that was thicker and worked well . This is so thin , that no matter how I try to attach it , it gets balled up before it gets to it 's desired position . I also wish I had bought sheets instead of table . Our sometimes stupid cat , is very crafty about reaching around the tape to scratch on either side of it .	-1
This is the worst product ever . It leaves a sticky mess on furniture . I have to have my furniture cleaned because of the sticky mess .	-1
Stopped using this product as soon as I realized it was made in China ! Can not take a chance since soooo many dogs are dying from food coming from China .	-1
The idea of this little contraption is great , but it is way too small . I guess if you have one cat and scoop daily , it will work well . We have three cats and clean the litter boxes every two to three days and there is not nearly enough room for all the discarded litter . Wish it were bigger .	-1
I have used this litter genie for a few days and I am sending it back for a refund . The top wo n't secure to the bottom enough for me to lift with the handle without the bottom swinging free and that is without the scoop attachment . The area to place the waste is very small . You would have to pull the handle out to let the waste drop a few times if you have more than one cat and are gone for several hours . And the odor is still noticeable if you are near the litter genie . I have a litter locker and like it far better . I just wish it had a handle .	-1
The top broke off on second day I should of return it but got too busy so I have a broken cat genie	-1
Gripe number one : The cartridge tells you to pull out about 12 '' of plastic and then tie a knot in the bottom before placing in the litter genie . I dutifully followed the instructions knowing the 12 '' suggestion did not match up with the actual height of the Litter Genie . If you follow the instructions , it will hold like ONE clump of urine . ( In response to a rather nasty comment on my review : there is nothing wrong with following the instructions on a product the first time out ... when I saw for sure that the bag would be too short , I pulled more of it out of the insert and went about my day . ) Gripe number two : The opening that you dump the litter into is way too small even with the scoop provided . I constantly have litter all over this thing . I feel like the whole thing is dirty and needs to get wiped down with antibacterial wipes every time I use it . I hate even touching it and I am so careful when I scoop ! Gripe number three : This thing does nothing to contain odor beyond a day or two . It may work wonders for people who use perfumed clay litters , but if you use something like `` World 's Best '' then it just sits in there and decays . No plastic contraption can keep THAT smell at bay . I walked into my house today and , for the first time ever , it smelled like I owned cats . Cats that were n't litter box trained . And this was after only about 5 days of collecting in the Genie . The Genie claims you can use it for two weeks . Two weeks was never my intention , but I was hoping to at least make it to the weekend ! I can only speak to my own experience and hope it is useful to someone else . I 've come to the conclusion that this thing is pretty stupid and wish I had n't spent the money . People that use scented clay litters are probably having better luck based on the reviews , but I would say `` natural '' litter users BEWARE .	-1
Hate this product , to hard to send back once I started using . I own the litter champ also , MUCH better then this , I do n't understand why pet stores have this and not litter champ , I have three cats , one of the springs broke on door of litter champ so I purchased another . Did n't know it had a warranty or I would have wrote company . Used for a while before this happened . Love other so much purchased as a gift . Would not get this one . It is n't good .	-1
We have multiple cats and have used Litter Locker successfully . Just received a Litter Genie and am disappointed . It is a little smaller and is flimsier than Litter Locker . I use kitchen bags for refills as they are much less expensive and you do not have to mess around cutting and tying . Litter Locker 's lid comes off so it is easy to fit the kitchen bag . With Litter Genie , the lid only flips up and you have to be careful when placing litter into it . Not sure why Litter Locker has not advertised like Genie . Will not buy another Genie.If you use the expensive refills , the Genie is probably OK .	-1
I returned this seems very flimsy . And I still worried that my dogs would be able to break through it .	-1
I have 3 cats it would seem at least one would like this but none of them did sorry to say	-1
First of all , I think most of the & # 34 ; positive reviews & # 34 ; on here were made by the company that makes the Clawguard . If you click on the & # 34 ; customers & # 34 ; , most of them have ONLY reviewed this product , which is very very suspicious . Anyway ... These are made from a cheap , flimsy , thin plastic , and come with one small piece of velcro . You could go to any craft store and buy this same plastic for cheaper , and just cut a hole in in . My dog weighs 35 pounds , and after 2 days of very moderate scratching , the plastic around the knob was ripped and had to come down.Save your money . Go to a hardware store and buy a sheet of plexiglass ...	-1
This looks like a floor guard that you use to protect your floor from scratches produced by a rolling computer chair . I think I 'll just buy one of those and cut a hole in for the doorknob ...	-1
I 'm baffled by the positive reviews this product has gotten . Is there perhaps something wrong with your dogs ? My dog is n't particularly intelligent , and yet he apparently had no problem pulling the guard down . I tried putting it back up , but I left the house for about 30 minutes , and when I came back , he had pulled it down again and chewed on it . Based on the positive reviews I kept thinking maybe I was doing something wrong , so I tried a few more times , each time pressing firmly on the velcro , making sure the opening was all the way over the knob , etc . Every time , he pulled it down and chewed on it . Obviously after a few days it was just too disgusting to even think about putting back on the door . This product was completely useless for me .	-1
Returned - Awful product . Sticky gummy pickle . Everything sticks to it . Yuck ! Would n't want my dog licking and chewing on this .	-1
I purchased this after receiving a return email from Starmark . They stated that this toy was for dogs of all sizes , even my small dog . Well , I can see it might be useful and fun for a large dog , but am sorry I purchased if for my JRT . It is a very heavy toy , and difficult for my little dog to use . Also , normal sized kibble falls right out of the big openings . I can not recommend this toy for small or even medium sized dogs .	-1
Thought this would last my lab/pit mix who is a heavy chewer but it not made as tough as the blue treat toy . Did n't even last through 1 teat play .	-1
Interesting idea , but my dog did n't take to it . The toy was heavily scented with vanilla , which I did not like . The smell contaminated the other items in my order , and I had to clean them off before using . The vanilla small was way too strong for dogs , and generally unpleasant	-1
Despite my dog 's long snout , she could not even get her jaws around this enormous monstrosity . it is WAY too big for smaller dogs ( i have a 16-lb dachshund ) . She ca n't even pick it up or carry it , much less get any treats out . The hard rubbery material does not have much give , so any treats remain wedged into the crevice.If your dog is & # 34 ; doggedly & # 34 ; determined , great . but my pampered pooch realized it was too much of a struggle and gave up after a few minutes.Better for large dogs .	-1
Cat likes the food , but after almost a month eating it he barfs it up . Switching to Natural Balance Green pea & Duck L.I.D .	-1
Works great when it works . First the charger pin broke off in the receiver the first day . Now , after less than two months the sender unit has stopped working . It 's a lot of money to keep breaking .	-1
inwas very disapointed when received the actual product . i expected to be made from higher quality material , not just regular cotton fabric . also size chart on their website is not so perfect . i followed the measurements but the vest is too big .	-1
My cats love to go outside and this vest which I thought would fit either of them does not . Had to give it away .	-1
I ordered this after I saw Jackson Galaxy putting it on all of the cats for outdoor use . Sidney will let me put it on , but it restricts his movements so much , he just lays on the ground and slinks an inch at a time . The fit is good , but he hates it , so I guess I do n't like it either .	-1
For some cats this would probably work great . My cat is too old to learn new tricks . It was funny watching him back up across the room. , but did n't work for us .	-1
I tried this harness on each of my two cats and they hated it . They do n't mind the harness that is just straps , but this one seem to have too much coverage to it for their liking . The thing is in my & # 34 ; pet supplies & # 34 ; box in it 's original wrapper .	-1
probably would have been a good fish tank but when we got it the bottom was cracked but returning it was no problemo	-1
This acrylic is very thin and brittle . The quality is poor and the product can not be fixed when the acrylic cracks . Apparently shipping stresses these beyond the ability of the tank to arrive in usable condition . Having made that clear , I would also say that if you need to clean this tank in the future you will be at high risk of cracking the bottom unless you use caution during the process . I would add a layer of clear tape to the bottom to reinforce it while it is new and dry . I am getting a replacement on this tank . I still like the size and the lighting features . The pump is useless and I will add my own pump . This fits perfectly on my desk . Buyer beware ! If this cracks and you have a leak all over your desk , and around your electrical wires etc . it would be very dangerous . Not for kids . This should be rated as `` Not for children '' because electrical hazards and use around children is not appropriate with this product . Employers may want to develop a corporate policy on this type of thing in the office . There may be high quality small aquariums available that would add ambience to the work place . This has serious hazards for cracking and leaking all over ruining equipment . If you do n't allow employees to bring coffee to the work station you definitely do n't want this in the work station . There is a spill hazards just cleaning and filling . Plus the maintenance of the tank will engage the employees time .	-1
Great size for the top of my bookshelf . Stay away from this brand , though . Nothing I purchased by them performs the way it should ( it was all purchased close together , or I would n't have wasted my money ) . The filter that came with this went out within a couple weeks . The lights were great for the first month , but then began to get dimmer and dimmer . I finally just removed the lid altogether and rigged up an old hood just so I could see my guppy fry.On the plus side , it holds water . That and the fact that it fits where I wanted it to fit are the only positives I can think of for this aquarium .	-1
The tank and the whole concept is great . However , in less than 6 months the LCD lights burnt out from getting wet . It 's a fish tank ! ! ! They should have sealed the lights up with silicone . Had I realized that , I would have sealed it myself . But there was no sealant and to purchase another top is more expensive that it 's worth . I WOULD NOT buy this ! ! !	-1
The Tank : I read through the reviews , most said good things . I did n't think the edges of the tank would greatly effect the view . You have to be looking straight on into the tank to see anything at all . Seems sturdy but not a big viewing angle.The Lid : I love the led 's . Its a nice clear light that i think the fish even like . The knockout pieces on the lid were very difficult to remove and ended up cutting them out . ( Their website said easy to remove ) The Filter : The filter is very strong . I would not reccommend smaller fish in this tank because they have a tough time getting around . After two days of use on this filter , its now making a terrible noise . It has poor reviews , which i found out later.Overall : The tank is below expectations but gets the job done .	-1
As too many of the other reviews said , it arrived today with a huge crack on it , hopefully the replacement will be OK , one more try I guess .	-1
Bought this back in the Spring just for a simple species tank with neons . The first one I got was scratched beyond acceptable because all of the extra stuff was bouncing around with no padding . Amazon sent a new one with no trouble ( good customer service always ) but it was scratched too . I did not want to waste time returning it again and this one seemed useable . I can not speak to the filter that came with it because I replaced it with a bio-wheel immediately . I should mention I have been keeping fish for 18 years . I decided to review it today , however , because the button for the light no longer works after such a short time . The light is fine , just the button is broken . Also I have never liked the hinge on the lid . It is messy and not very secure .	-1
We got this tank because the wife did n't want another square box with fish in it . The design is different enough to stand out and at the price , seemed like a good value . However , there are two big flaws with this tank:1 ) No matter what I did , the lights died out in 2 months , the replacements lasted just as long . They start to get more and more dim as time passes as if they were a flash light running on batteries that were nearing empty.2 ) The Acrlic is n't a very high grade and is not very durable . Some suction cups that were part of my filter , heater , etc all left what looked like circular surface scratches . However , they were much worse than scratches , they were actually stress fractures from the vacuum that eh suction cups create . They were very noticeable.I ended up replacing the tank with a Radius 5 gallon tank by Penn Plax . It 's true when they say you get what you pay for , we paid a little more and have a really high quality rimless glass tank .	-1
I purchased three of these for two reasons - they were relatively cheap ( $ 25 ) and I required a tight fitting gap free lid . After having them a while now , I have to say that 's still about it on positives.The ones I received did come with a med size HOB power filter that actually looked ok . Unfortunately I did n't need the filters and never used them , so I ca n't say any more about them.The manufacturers packaging was terrible , just a thin cardboard box with no cushioning . One of the three was cracked at the top . Easily repaired , but if I was concerned with appearance it would have had to be returned.The tanks are a curved shape , and the distortion is unacceptable from every angle other than straight on . The LED lights are decent , but some are already out and condensation is visible inside the clear cover over the bulbs- I do n't expect any of them to last . The flat lid design is a nice idea , but useless if the light fixture is n't properly sealed.I purchased these to house crayfish , so I only needed to drill one hole for an airline to run a sponge filter . The very substantial , escape proof lid is nice for crays . I would hate to have to modify it for a filter and heater for fish , and the distortion rules it out as a good display tank . Since the crays prefer darkness , the vanishing LEDs are n't even a huge deal , so for my purpose this tank just barely fills the bill.If you want more than a sort-of-clear 5 gallon plastic container with a lid , I would definitely look elsewhere .	-1
I have yet to receive this though ordered twice .what more is there to say ? I will keep waiting for it .	-1
The tool is crudely machined and does not appear to be made of a high quality stainless steel . The edges are too sharp to use on a dog 's teeth as-is . I will probably grind the edges down in order to make them more consistent and safe for my dog . I am really hoping not to discover this scraper is plated with some other metal when I grind it down . If so it will be useless .	-1
it never came when I ordered it . It was supposed to be in the package I ordered and it was missing .	-1
I 've been trying to use this to scrape tarter off my dog 's teeth in conjunction with PetZlife dental rub and I find this a little thick and not very sharp to use . I have so far not had an success with it .	-1
My basset hound is not a chewer and had a lot of brown gunk near the gum line . I could n't get the straight tool into the right position to get at the curved gum line . On the face of the tooth it just slid off and did n't remove much .	-1
This product does not work . I have been putting it on my dogs food for over a month and she still produces tear stains .	-1
I ordered Chicken Flavor instead of Beef . I had great success with the Beef and absolutely NONE with the Chicken Flavor . The chicken is 'natural ' . whatever that may mean , to me it means It does n't work . My shih tzu took the chicken angels eyes for over two months with NO RESULTS . She does n't eat food with dyes in it , drinks spring water , is bathed every two to three weeks , in other words I follow all the recommendations . Do yourself a favor and do n't order the Natural Angels Eyes . I wrote to Angel Eyes and they sent back a 'sorry ' and that 's it . I 'm trying to work with the seller to return the unused natural and get the beef flavored . I 'll update if I get my return or refund . It cost me $ 54.00 which is quite an investment in something that does n't work for me .	-1
And when they did finally eat it , it upset their stomachs and made them throw up . I think there was something wrong with it . Ended up throwing it out when they did the same thing with 2 new cans of it from the same box .	-1
Complete waste of money ... . catnipped it up and none of my cats touch it . I 've tried getting them on it and play with it ... They look at me like I have three eye balls . Save your money unless your cat is easily amused .	-1
I did not keep this . Latch did not close so the puppy could easily get into the bin . Gave me a hassle with the return but in the end it was returned . I suggest buying from a store so you can check the latch because if that does n't work what is the point .	-1
The latch is defective . If you want an airtight , easy open , stays-shut food holder , this ai n't it . For now I am just weighting it shut .	-1
I 'm another reviewer who had problems with the latch . It has to be pushed down to actually latch which is n't that big of a deal , except for the fact that it is incredibly easy to UN-latch . Any nuzzling at all by a dog or a very light touch of a human hand is enough to unlatch.I LOVE Vittles Vault airtight containers that spin shut , so I 'm very disappointed in this .	-1
... . as this is for the `` plastic '' version only.No WHERE in the description does it say this ! When I got my order , it does say it on the boxes they come in . I have the `` 360 '' stainless model and the pump design is slightly different.Had I looked further down the very unorganized list of products offered on Amazon from this provider I would have stumbled upon this , but again , this should have been stated in the products description . I blindly ordered a year 's supply of the WRONG pre-filters but I can make them work , so I will be able to use them.For this reason , this product only gets three stars due to poor advertising as I 'm sure the same misinformation will cause others to order the wrong filters also .	-1
I wanted to try this dog food to see if it would help reduce itchy skin . I did n't see any difference , my dog itches as before . What I did notice is that her coat got a little dull and she started to have gas . She has never had gas problem before . For the price , I would not recommend this dog food . I am switching to something else .	-1
I have four dogs and one in particular just loves to drag her butt on anything . I have had her tested for worms and she is clean . The Vet showed me how to go around her anal gland in a circular motion and pop any cysts in her anal glands but she has been clear of them . I thought the Pet Naturals Vermont Scoot Bars were going to be the answer to my prayers but nope . It has been a couple weeks but no change at all . She LOVES the bars and I do n't understand why since I think they are smelly . She continues to drag her butt across on my carpets , stone tiled floor and even our beds . Maybe I need to find some kind of probiotic colon pill for dogs ! Sadly , these so far have not worked . I will continue to give her the bars till they are gone but will look for other methods to cure her itchy butt .	-1
At one bar for 20 pounds of dog this should have worked out to a 10 day supply , but after less than half a bag I can tell they do not work on my dog for anal gland expression -they give him the runs . I have isolated these from other extras in his diet , but it is the same every time he has them , even after just one . Firm stools work the glands ; very very loose ones do not . In fact , that contributes to the problem . So while he actually loves the bars , they do n't love him . I 'm sticking with canned , pure pumpkin . It is much more effective , much cheaper , and much easier on my dog . I was hopeful , because it would have been so much easier to give him these bars as treats to firm him up , but they just do n't agree with him .	-1
Bought these all they did is give my dog runny stool will not going to buy these ever again : (	-1
When I opened this bag the first thing I noticed was that these 'bars ' are rock hard . One of my dogs is elderly , so I knew this would be an issue.I broke apart the bar into pieces and softened the bar with hot water . It was mixed together with the dogs ' regular food.The younger dog tried the pieces but spit them out and left them beside his empty bowl . He is not a picky eater , so this surprised me.The elderly dog tried to eat the piece I gave him , but even softened the piece was too hard for his teeth.In conclusion , my dogs were unimpressed with the Scoot Bars . I will not be purchasing in the future .	-1
Granted , our spoiled boy is very picky , so I was not totally surprised when he did not like the flavor of these . I passed them on to a neighbor who 's dog has quite a scooting issue . Did n't help him , and made his stool even runnier , so he was scooting all the more , in part to clean himself off . I 've tried other Pet Naturals products and found them great , so our experience may be the exception and not the rule .	-1
UPDATE : After using these bars for a month , I am not as happy as I was at first . When we first started using them , we did n't notice any scooting for awhile and were elated that our `` anal gland procedure '' days seemed over . Not so . About 3 weeks into the package , we noticed him scooting again , and I had to retrieve the Vaseline and Rubber Gloves from the utility cabinet . Oh My ! His poor anal glands were full to almost bursting because they had n't been expressed in several weeks ! What a relief to get his weekly treatments again.Now , after a month of use , we are noticing that our little dog is getting noticably portly and I think these bars have something to do with his newfound obesity . We loved them at first , but in the long run I have decided that they do not work for the intended purpose and they are very VERY FATTENING . He is now a little butter-butt and we still have to express his anal glands . No more scoot bars for him ! ! ! I have changed my original 5 star review to a one star review . Sorry , but Scoot Bars do n't work well at all in the long term . For people who want to know my first impressions , I have left my original review intact below : Original Review : We have a small-ish dog who has `` the scoots '' . Painful for him and expensive for us , because our vet charges $ 40.00 per incident to clear his anal glands . Since he needs them cleared every week or two , the cost was mounting up and so we learned to do `` the job '' ourselves - it involves Vaseline , rubber gloves , and humiliation for the dog ! This is unpleasant for us as well as him but we could n't go on paying a vet to do a job the he needs done as often as he is bathed.Needless to say , I was elated to find these Scoot Bars offered and so I thought I 'd give them a try . Our dog loves them and gobbles them up within minutes of getting one . We actually have to confine our other dogs when he gets his daily `` treat '' because they smell so yummy that they try to take it from him . And believe me , he does n't object to having a special goodie that only he is allowed to have ! LOL ! The great news is that it has been two weeks now and I have not seen him scoot once since we started these bars . These are now a permanent part of our dog care routine . What a great product ! No more rubber gloves for me , no more weekly vet bills , and no more being violated for him ! YAY ! I will check back and update my review in about a month and will let you know if the scooting returns , but as for now I think we have found a very nice alternative to the invasive and smelly job of expressing his anal glands .	-1
My Chihuahua has been prone to the butt-scoots every once and a while , usually when he is have a hard to time evacuating his bowels . I was hoping the Scoot-Bars would eliminate the scooting . But the first time I gave him one , three bowel movements later and he was scooting away . The next Scoot-Bar I gave him , the very next bowel movement he was scooting along the carpet . He did not do any scooting after the next couple bars I gave him , but he still does scoot ever once in a while so I am not sure the product has much effect in stopping the butt scoot . The package says that it supports proper stool consistency for anal gland health . It does have an effect on his stool , it seems softer and a bit greener than usual . On the bright side , sometime my dog , who is up there in age and missing more than a few teeth , had no problem eating the Scoot-Bars and enjoyed them a lot .	-1
I tried out the Pet Naturals of Vermont Scoot Bars on my 10 year old Golden Retriever . She has a bit of a delicate digestive system , but no real illness of any sort . Whenever she has a bit of a digestive upset , she `` scoots '' I know what the problem is and how to `` empty '' the problem area , but it 's not the most pleasant process for either of us . I decided to give the Scoot Bars a try even though I was a bit skeptical that a food product might work for this problem . After the first few days of the bars , I have to say that she really stopped scooting . Maybe it was just a coincidence , but I was becoming a believer . But , then after a week or so of 1 Scoot Bar a day , her digestive system decided it had had enough and she developed doggie diarrhea . Nothing serious , just a lot of trips outside and back end clean-ups . She did not , however , scoot afer these episodes.So , unfortunately , our experience is that the Pet Naturals of Vermont Scoot Bars have solved one problem for my dog , but created another . Truth be told , I 'd rather have the `` scooting '' than the `` doggie diarrhea . '' I 'm tempted to try the Scoot Bars on my 1 year old golden , just to see if he developes the same problem - but he does n't ever `` scoot '' so I do n't think it would be a valid experiment.If your dog exhibits scooting behavior , these bars might be worth a try - but I 'd be wary if your dog has any pre-existing digestive issues . I 'm back to being a bit skeptical about this product .	-1
The Product : I have to say that my dog likes these things a lot . They are n't her # 1 favorite ( she 's spoiled and gets a lot of junk ) , but she does her little happy dance to get one . They are a bit smelly , and I will be honest , I have not gone out to check the yard or gotten her anal glands expressed since I have been giving her these to know if they are actually working , but as a treat she really enjoys them . She never used to scoot , but she did used to chase her tail , which the vet told me was a sign of full anal glands and that behavior has stopped since I gave her this product . For the product itself:5 starsThe Price : Now the price . . . Since my dog has issues with her anal glands , and I have even had issues with my cat getting blockages that have led him to see a doctor , I have to say this product is VERY expensive ! ! ! ! ! ! My dog is 50 lbs , and you are supposed to give 1 stick per 20 lbs per day , I have been giving her 2 a day . So this bag of 30 will only last 2 weeks and at the price it is far too much . My vet has told me to just give both the cats and the dog some canned pumpkin a few times a week and the price of the pumpkin in negligible and both the cats and dog love it . I know this product claims to `` provides immune , digestive and colonic support '' but I do n't need those benefits . I am sure that if this product , or any other product , was that much better than just plain canned pumpkin my vet would have told me about it , plus my dog does more than enough to make sure her immune system is in top form , and usually she does it in the grossest ways possible . So for the price:1 starThe Sum up : A good product , but my dog would much rather have her `` bone money '' spent for actual greasy marrow filled bones than these treats she eats in 2 minutes . If you do n't want to deal with the canned pumpkin this works but at a much higher cost.Overall 2 1/2 stars .	-1
This food has made my poor cat sick , she has been throwing up , but this not hair balls , it 's just food . she also developed diarrhea since being switched to this food . I do like the non-grain free version of Wellness ( red bag ) , but after this experience I may switch to another brand completely .	-1
Ordered Salmon Jerky , got chicken . Not acceptable as my dog may be allergic to chicken . Amazon gave full credit , but left me without needed treats for training .	-1
for years i order these products for animals and now after this last time of illness never again ... something is not right with this product	-1
You 'll see the principal problem with this entire line of products if you read the amount of & # 34 ; happy hip & # 34 ; ingredients , and then look at how much a dog has to consume to get the benefit from it . They 'd have to eat the entire bag every day . Simply not enough of the key ingredients for this to be anything more than cheaply made dog jerky with a lot of rice in it .	-1
We buy a lot of dog products from amazon . We bought these in August but did n't get around to opening them u til December.This bag was burnt product inside . We 've bought dozens of the same treat with great success , but I guess a few bad ones get thru.I DO NOT blame the seller at all , this was a manufacturing issue before product was shipped . They came from china , which always worries me..	-1
I like that it 's a single ingredient treat , which is necessary for my dog with allergies . I had purchased these in a local pet store for twice the Amazon price . They are very fragile and prone to crumbling , making them difficult to keep in tact . The treats from Amazon arrived and were approximately half crumbled and not able to be used for treats . I liked the idea of them , but the freeze drying process makes them too delicate for use as treats .	-1
I bought this collar for my previous dog , but did n't need it until a year later with my new dog . I dug this unit out and the battery is shot . The battery is not user-serviceable and Petsafe charges $ 70 for a new transmitter . In short , I 've never used this item and now I have to spend $ 70 on top of the $ 160 I already spent because Petsafe wants to sell you a replacement transmitter rather than use a standard battery . This is standard practice for Petsafe . That 's why Petsafe is only for rookies who do n't know any better .	-1
This unit is VERY heavy and holds a lot of water . Unfortunately , the pump just was n't up to the job and died within 4 months . I have tried water fountains in several brands , and none of the pumps last very long . Problem is compounded by the fact that the pump has to have a specific configuration and water output spout size , so is hard to replace . My cats love moving water , but I 'm going broke keeping it moving .	-1
My cats loved the previous plastic drinking fountain but this one they would n't go near . One time shortly after I got it , I plugged it in and the pump would n't start . I unplugged and tried again and it started but after reading the reviews about faulty pumps , I was n't going to risk it . I might have held on to it anyway if it were n't for the cats not going near it anyway . It was also very difficult to tell the fill level of the water .	-1
This is the tiniest collar , I 've ever seen . I ca n't imagine what dog could wear this . The collar itself is made out of the cheapest material you can possibly imagine . It 's rigid and unbending . Do n't recommend it at all .	-1
this thing took forever to arrive and when it finally did i discovered it was nothing more than a tiny piece of junk barely big enough for a cat . JUNK . not worth it to ship it back	-1
I followed the directions and it worked at first , but then it just stopped working . Nothing I tried could get it to work again , so I returned it .	-1
this thing buzzed maybe once since i got it . there are not indicators to let you know that it is fully charged or operational . it feels like it is cheaply made . i guess you get what you paid for . additionally , my dog looks like a mangy mutt with that big , bulky thing on the side of his neck . the range of the remote is line of sight so good luck if your pup ducks into some bushes while chasing a squirrel or following a tempting scent . Do n't waste your money . ( I could probably recoup some of my money by selling it on Amazon but I do n't want to do that to another pet parent . this thing is not worth it ) I threw it away already .	-1
My two 3-year-olds have bravely tried the dozens of organic and conventional foods I 've offered them throughout their young lives in hopes of finding favorites for them . They like most Meow Mix flavors but just sniff at these `` toppers , '' leaving them in the dish for any other benighted cat fool enough to try them .	-1
My cat refuses to eat this . She 'll pick at the shreds with her paw then walk away without actually eating anything . I thought she would like this because she likes both shreds and pate , but apparently she does n't like them together , or maybe it 's this particular brand . Looks like I 'll be sticking with Friskies .	-1
expensive.cord is elastic , can whip dog 's face , your face , anyone nearbys face . and hard . can poke an eye out.cord is flimsy.made several cheaper , sturdy flirtpoles with home depot supplies for less than the cost of this item .	-1
I feed my dog another brand of Nature 's Valley , so I was excited to try this brand . As soon as it arrived my dog was eagerly smelling the bag and I thought for sure that it was going to be a winner . Unfortunately , the two days that my dog ate this brand he had runny poop and so I had to switch him back to his normal brand ( and his poop went back solid ) .	-1
How many times have we heard you look at a bag of dog foods first ingredient . That will tell you what type of dog food you are buying for your dogs . The first ingredient `` should be '' chicken , beef , or fish . The first ingredient of Instinct raw boost is chicken meal . To me that says it all . It is not a good choice for my dogs as I always purchase a dog food by the rule that most dog professionals tell you . LOOK AT THE FIRST INGREDIENT . Also , the freeze dried raw pieces are far and few between the Kibble . At $ 16.00 a bag for chicken meal , I wo n't be buying this product . You can get the same type of dog food on your grocery shelves , like Alpo or Pedigree , not what most Veterinarians consider good quality dog food .	-1
I am familiar with this brand of dog food and it is rated highly on almost every dog food analysis website . My dog has been eating this mixed with his Wellness Core which he has been eating for the past 5 years without any issues . My dog 's stool has remained the same and he is not showing any residual effects from eating this dog food . In fact he likes it a lot and he is one picky dog . I agree with some of the reviewers that stated that their dog picks out the freeze dried pieces but the dog will have to eat the rest regardless because there are not a lot of freeze dried pieces in the bag to fill them up . I will continue to mix this food with the Wellness Core since my dog is enjoying it . The pieces of food are very small so you might need to supplement with some type of dental chew if you are only going to feed your big dog this food . I gave it 4 stars because of the small pieces and the fact that the high cost does not seem necessary since there are so few pieces of freeze dried food in the bag . ****UPDATE 3/19/14****Well , my dog has become very itchy after 3 months of feeding him this mixed in with Wellness Core . My dog has been on Wellness Core for 4 years without any issues . Now he is scratching at himself throughout the day . I have stopped feeding him this food as of yesterday . Please beware that if your dog is prone to skin allergies , this food may flare things up . Wellness Core has been a godsend to my sweet boy and I will continue to give him this high quality dog food . If you are not sure whether your dog 's food is good or not check out [ ... ] It has almost every dog food on there .	-1
At first glance , some of the food items in the long , long list of ingredients in this pet food seem appealing : stuff like apples , flaxseed , and pumpkin seeds strike a wholesome chord in the anxious dogowner 's heart . But looking at all the ingredients there 's also a lot of stuff like ground chicken bone , chicken `` meal '' ( less than 20 % actual chicken ) , something called `` montmorillonite clay '' and the less-than-delicious sounding `` dried enterococcous faecium fermentation product . '' I really do n't want my dogs eating clay and faeces . If you would n't feed it to your kids , do n't give it to your dogs .	-1
After noticing lots of hay/grass like long thin pieces in the kibble , curiosity got the better of me and i decided to see just what this was . I picked up two pieces of kibble and something pinched my finger . Upon closer examination I saw a tiny bone shard sticking out of the kibble . Sharp and with a pointy end . My cat nibbled on this kibble for one meal then would n't touch it . Apparently Instinct did n't have the time or interest or wanted to spend the extra money to make sure they process the meat properly . Completely unacceptable .	-1
First , let me say that my Akita loves these things . The product itself , despite a recall in 2011 , seems to be great.Now , let 's get to the 1 star part . Over the past couple years , since the recall of the 10-12 '' Texas Taffy , I have made a casual notice that the size of the product seemed to be getting smaller . Add to this a price increase.In the past few months , I have bought 3 boxes of the 10-12 '' Texas Taffy . There is no way that these things are anywhere near 10-12 '' . With today 's arrival of a brand new box I measured all the chews.The average size : 8.25 inchesI wrote to Merrick customer service last week , and I was informed that the product is now 7-9 inches . I have 3 problems with all this:1 . This product is still advertised as 10-12 '' from places that sell it online.2 . Extrapolating from the sizes of today 's box , I estimate the average size of past boxes ( 2008-2011 ) to be ~ 11.25 inches.3 . Looking at my receipts since 2008 for the purchase of 30 count boxes of 10-12 '' Texas Taffy the prices have have risen by an average of almost 10 $ per box.How much more can we , as consumers , take with companies flagrantly ripping us off ? Todays box : 6.73 inches to 9.29 inches AVG=8.25Older box estimate : 9.73 to 12.29 inches AVG=11.25= 27 % decrease in size2008-2010 avg price : 40.992011-2013 VG PRICE : 50.8819 % increase in price	-1
Very pretty color and is flexible like silicone should be . But the smell is some off ammonia type smell . Very icky . Cant recommend this brand . Made my aquarium water smell like the hose .	-1
Firstly , none of my fish ate this - which is weird . They 're total gluttons for just about everything ... Secondly , allergic reactions to this are VERY common and VERY severe ! I have a shellfish allergy , and apparently if you have just about any allergic reaction to things , you 're at an increased risk for bloodworm allergy from what I have read . It can also develop later on , and appears to be worst with freeze-dried varieties vs frozen . I reacted very bad to just handling the container.I can not keep this in my house due to the reactions , so if you purchase , please be careful with handling the first few times.Additionally , my fish will eat the frozen varieties which cause me less issue . I recommend them .	-1
They did n't hatch	-1
I 'm not sure why . This brand has a very good reputation . I got a low hatch rate though . I 'd still buy from them , but am more likely to just buy live in the future .	-1
Zukes Greens are much better than this product -plus it has stuff I did n't recognize in it.My dogs love Zukes Greens !	-1
These do n't even smell appealing ! I know dogs do n't smell like we do , but even the dogs do n't want them . I have a doggie daycare , so I 've tried them on numerous dogs , lol .	-1
My dogs did not eat these . Maybe yours will but for me I had to rate this low since it did not meet my expectations .	-1
My dog has a chicken allergy . I assumed that these healthy SALMON Semi-Moist Dog Treats would contain only salmon . I was wrong . The list of ingredients is endless , filled with things you would n't expect to see on & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; healthy & # 34 ; dog treats . Fortunately , my neighbor 's dog reluctantly accepted them , so I did n't have to return it or throw it away . But seriously ... make sure you research your dog treats before buying them . I learned that lesson the hard way today ...	-1
The hollow runs are just too inviting for a parrot to chew off . I bought 3 of these and he seems to think they are a chew toy . He is a chewer , so I guess I should have expected that to happen .	-1
When I saw this product was made with all natural materials , it sounded like a win ! It looked like rope , and wood.Not exactly . When it arrived , not only did I notice that the rungs are held together with glue , it was poorly applied -- resulting in visible glue spots on many of the rungs -- one of them the size of a quarter.That in itself might have been okay . But then I noticed that several of the rungs were completely loose , sliding up and down on the rope . I gently pushed one that seemed solid , and it , too , moved.Rather than return it , I fixed it by taking it apart and using another ( longer ) piece of rope . I placed a knot under and above each rung . Now the rungs are solid .	-1
Duke is afraid to use the ladder as it is a bit unstable . However , he does enjoy chewing the steps off .	-1
Now that I see Tyson puts out this product I would run for the hills . Tyson is the most horrible , evil company guilty of atrocious abuse and treatment of their chickens which live horrendously awful lives . This company has no problem doing evil takeovers and manipulation so they can control the chicken market and treat the animals in a horrendous manner . There are videos of chickens being hurled against the walls and horribly abused by laborers there while they die . I would n't give this company a nickel . They know no limits when it comes to the concept of evil . Note how the product does not display it is Tyson . Do n't believe anything this company says or does . I will spare you the gory details , just stay far away from Tyson ... .	-1
When I had heard enough about dogs getting sick or dying after eating Chinese chicken jerky , I went looking for products made in the US and found this and have ordered several 1 lb bags . When fewer and fewer vendors were listed on amazon and the price quadrupled from my last purchase , I called the manufacturer to see if they had stopped making the product . The person said no , they had reformulated it so I waited for that to show up . Now it has so I went back to the manufacturer 's web site to see what they changed.I was appalled by what I found . From my bags of the old product here is a list of the ingredients . Chicken , natural smoke flavor . That 's all.Here 's the reformulated product ingredient list : Chicken , betaine , brown sugar , cultured dextrose , sea salt , natural smoke flavor , garlic powder , mixed tocopherols ( preservative ) , paprika extract color , rosemary extract.I did n't know what betaine was so I looked it up on the net . After reading about it , I still do n't know what it is.The crude protein dropped from 77 % to 50 % .crude fat increased from 2 % to 5 % .moisture increased from 18 % to 28 % .I am not going to give this product to my dog and will make my own chicken jerky in the oven.___________________Update : I just went to a new Petco that opened near me . I found a 1 lb package of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats . Made in the US.Ingredients : Chicken breasts , natural flavorings.Crude protein 70 % Crude fat 3-7 % Moisture 10 % I will be buying these once I use up my old stock of True Chews.____________________Update 2 ( 8/17/13 ) : Since its been over a year since I last looked at True Chews , I decided to see if they 've changed their product . Yes they have : Premium Jerky CutsIngredients : Chicken , Vegetable Glycerin , Distilled Vinegar , Salt , Natural Smoke Flavor , Paprika Extract Color , Garlic Powder , Mixed Tocopherols ( Preservative ) , Rosemary Extract.Crude Protein : 40 % Crude Fat : 9 % Moisture : 28 % I 've ordered Colorado Naturals bags several times from the Petco web site and am very pleased with how soft the product is and how they have n't changed the ingredients ! _______________Update 3 ( 5/22/14 ) : I just received a new shipment of Colorado Naturals Chicken Jerky Dog Treats from petco.com and noticed a sticker on the back of the bags with new percentages : Crude protein dropped from 70 % to 50 % Crude fat increased from 3-7 % to 5-30 % Salt increased from 0.3 % max to 3.0 % max.I immediately took the bags back to a store . I will not be buying this product any longer . I got a merchandise credit and went looking at the jerky section of the store . They had a section of `` Made in the USA '' products and I looked at a bag labeled American Jerky Chicken Strips . The back of the bag says petco so I guess its their new product.Ingredients : Chicken breastCrude protein : 83 % Crude fat : 4.2 % Moisture : 11.9 % I will be ordering this product from the petco web site.Just got my shipment from petco . This reminds me a lot of how True Chews used to be when it was just made up of chicken and flavor . But its not as hard so it probably wo n't break my scissors like TC had done several times . Hope petco does n't mess with this and I can stop having to find new products !	-1
I know different dogs react differently , but my dog had the first ever runny farts in her entire 14 year long life after eating this product I could hear her across the yard . Enough said ? It was gross . Do n't even know what to do with the rest of the bag but throw it out . It 's a shame .	-1
My dog played with it but I was disappointed to discover that this product is made of a soft flexible rubber-like material . The inner maze is not attached to the wall so my dog managed to move it within the ball and preventing the treats from coming out . It is nearly impossible to clean and quickly developed a dingy look . It works but just is n't what I had hoped .	-1
It was good until one of the Shelties was able to break off pieces of the ball and swallow them ... .then it was a nightmare ...	-1
The rubber plastic is so cheaply made if you have a chewer he will eat through this ball in no time ! ! Save your money buy something else ! !	-1
It would be a good idea if it were surrounded by a stronger material . It is way softer and stretchy than a rubber ball . Even a little dog could chew through this .	-1
this product does not compare to capstar . it may use the same ingredient but its does n't work the same . it must contain garlic ( which is supposed to be bad for dogs ) cause when i give it to my chihuahuas , there breath smells like they 've been chewing on a garlic clove . wow ! aside from the garlic smell , i usually have to give them a full five day course for it to take effect and kill the fleas . one capstar does the trick . I also bought the diatomasous earth from the same company . it does work well .	-1
got ta give it to my dogs daily for it to work	-1
this product does not work ! ! my dogs have been on control for 2 months and i did the killer every day for a week now and still have fleas ! i contacted the seller and they were rude ! talking to me like i was stupid trying to & # 34 ; educate me & # 34 ; on what a flea is asking if i really had fleas DUDE ! i am a veterinary assistant i KNOW what a flea is and its life cycle ! I 've done the control the killer and the dust out side i have tried MANY products my area is BAD with fleas my neighbors are battling them also.. i am NOT a neglectful owner who expects an over night fix when i told the seller this they responded with & # 34 ; we do n't read or respond to venting emails & # 34 ; .. this tells me they must get a lot ! and told me i wont be replied to ... then replied again telling me i need to use the product right uummm hello your REPLYING and how am i using it wrong i got the right size dose and i give my dogs the pill same day each month ! they are a JOKE ! and RUDE ...	-1
I did n't see any difference . Also , please read all of the info , depending on the size of your dog , you may have to give several at a time . I would recommend and I am staying with comfortis . This works bar none for me and my dog has had no ill effects from it .	-1
My dog plays with other animals , including the stray cats that roam near our house , so he 's always getting other animals fleas on him ( he 's on Frontline . ) I used capstar before and it killed the fleas instantly when they got on him . I tried these things and it did n't phase them at all.My pup is short haired so it 's easy to see them on his stomach . Rolled him over after 30 minutes , picked one off of him ( still alive . ) Rolled him over 4 hours later , picked another one off of him ( still alive and jumping like normal . ) He does n't get many , just random ones that jump off one animal onto him , but these things are annoying . -_-And this product did not work for me . : [	-1
I was really hoping this would help with the sudden flea problem that has occurred with our pets . Like most people , I 've used generic medications and under most circumstances , at least for humans , they seem to work the same way . I understood that this was a generic version of Capstar . It did not work like the equivalent version of that medication . The fleas did not react at all in any of our dogs . One dog threw up the medication after every dose . Some people report great success with their purchase , so it all must come down to poor quality control.I purchased this along with several other Little City Dog products , and while the price is more favorable , its just a waste if the quality is n't there.I 'd avoid this product .	-1
Original positive review : I have rescued a very large , long haired mutt and two smaller shorter haired dogs and three cats . We try to use generic medications for all our pets to manage cost . This is a bad year in our area for fleas and we hoped that Fiproguard Fiproguard Topical Flea and Tick would be sufficient.Unfortunately , we found many fleas on the dogs within a week of treating them . I tried repeated Dawn baths and frequent vacuuming of our hardwood floors , but the big dog especially had many fleas.I treated all the dogs with Nitenpyram and after about an hour , checked their coats with a comb . The fleas were dead and the itching subsided for the day.I will have to find a long term solution that includes treating the yard , but at least they have relief for now.Conclusion : fleas dead , dogs seem fine . This appears to be a safe and effective product.Update : I used this on my pets and they still have live fleas . This product no longer works . So disappointing that a formerly great product is n't even a little effective anymore . What happened , Little City Dogs ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I 've tried a few toys by Petstages but all have lead to disappointment.The Durable Stick looked like a great idea . It made sense , we have two Old English Bulldogs who are serious Stick addicts . We were hopeful this toy would become a favorite.Durable it is anything but.Within minutes they were eating the toy like a cookie and tiny particles of `` scented wood '' were spilling out everywere . Our dogs were swallowing as much if not more than was spreading out all over the floor and furniture.I 'll caveat the following statements by saying we are animal lovers.Our dogs are family , I began researching dog food and toys before there was an Internet .

I 've been making my own dog food for over 30 years - you 'll find out of my 80 reviews published on Amazon over 40 % are dedicated to dog toys , nutritional supplements , special dog care products and other related dog items.That said , here is a list of concerns about this product:1 ) The toy is manufactured in China - consumers have every reason to be highly suspect of any dog food or toy coming from China.Every major recall including the 2007 nation wide disaster where thousands of dogs and cats died was due to Gluten imported from China . Reading the Petstages web site it 's implied their toys are made in the United States - they aren't.2 ) Not only does the toy leave tiny particles of wood everywhere . Again , your dog will ingest this material.The Danger : There is no list of ingredients on the package . The consumer has no idea what the scent is made of w. Or what chemicals are used to process the wood . No information whatsoever is provided on the packaging - with exception of promotional fluff . * The Animal and Veterinary division of the FDA states that all dog foods , treats and `` Digestible Toys '' MUST include a label of ingredients.For Petstages to ignore this requirement is not only irresponsible - it 's against the law . *fda.gov/AnimalVeterinaryTOYS YOU CAN TRUST : Nylabone - made in the USA for more than 50 yearsKong - Made in the USAKong Treats - Made in the USA of excellent ingredients and labeled in accordance to Law.Orbee - Sensational , innovative toys - Made in the USABased on the disturbing information regarding Petstages products I can not recommend them whatsoever.What is more - I would urge any Pet Lover to avoid this product at all costs .

I have a 50 pound Samoyed . I was recommended this product by one of my friends . At first , I noticed the package says , `` assembled in China '' , then I thought , `` Hmm ... what else is n't made in China these days ? `` , so I gave it to my Samoyed anyway . After about 10 mins of him chewing the wood/ stick , I noticed , as many others have , that small chunks of wood pieces had gotten chewed off by my dog and I was way too late to stop him from swallowing the pieces . I took the stick away immediately.According to petstages , this stick is safe to ingest and the materials are from the USA . However , what concerns me is that I have no idea what are inside the stick as they did not have any information about the ingredients of the product anywhere on the package . I am unsure if I will buy the product again , given that it might not be so safe to dogs after all .	-1

We were hopeful this toy would become a favorite.Durable it is anything but.Within minutes they were eating the toy like a cookie and tiny particles of `` scented wood '' were spilling out everywere . Our dogs were swallowing as much if not more than was spreading out all over the floor and furniture.I 'll caveat the following statements by saying we are animal lovers.Our dogs are family , I began researching dog food and toys before there was an Internet . We are passionate about their health and well being . I 've been making my own dog food for over 30 years - you 'll find out of my 550 reviews published on Amazon over 40 % are dedicated to dog toys , nutritional supplements , special dog care products and other related dog items.That said , here is a list of concerns about this product:1 ) The toy is manufactured in China - consumers have every reason to be highly suspect of any dog food or toy coming from China . Every major recall including the 2007 nation wide disaster where thousands of dogs and cats died was due to Gluten imported from China.2 ) Not only does the toy leave tiny particles of wood everywhere . Again , your dog will ingest this material . Reading the Petstages web site it 's implied their toys are made in the United States - they aren't.3 ) The overwhelming majority of positive reviews for this product are highly suspect as the reviewers have only have reviewed this one item . It is my considered opinion that these are bogus , planted reviews.The Danger : There is no list of ingredients on the package . The consumer has no idea what the scent is made of - Or what chemicals are used to process the wood . No information whatsoever is provided on the packaging - with exception of promotional fluff . * The Animal and Veterinary division of the FDA states that all dog foods , treats and `` Digestible Toys '' MUST include a label of ingredients.For Petstages to ignore this requirement is not only irresponsible - it 's against the law . *fda.gov/AnimalVeterinaryTOYS YOU CAN TRUST : Nylabone - made in the USA for more than 50 yearsKong - Made in the USAKong Treats - Made in the USA of excellent ingredients and labeled in accordance to Law.Orbee - Sensational , innovative toys - Made in the USABased on the disturbing information regarding Petstages products I can not recommend them .

My dog had this toy shreaded in less than a week , very disappointed in this product , would not buy if you have a dog/puppy that likes to chew	-1
The only reason this gets two stars instead of 1 star is that it did work ok as a car cat containment system . My cats tolerated it well on their cross country journey.However I would NEVER leave a cat in it outside that I was not watching all the time ( no looking away at all ) Takes one of my cats less than 30 seconds to open the zippers and get out . I was in a state park when this happened and if my cat had not willingly returned to me I would never have seen her again . Since I did n't have anything to replace this in the car - she did get out again in the car - but I was able to pull over without incident to get her back in.In addition to having zippers that are easily opened by cats - this thing is very poorly made . the wires are sticking out of the fabric . zippers do not align properly .	-1
I followed the instructions . I cleaned the outside of my tank . I rinsed off the brand new `` magnet '' even though it was new with fresh tapwater ( the side that goes in the tank ) . I then floated it inside the aquarium before putting it on the side of the tank . Stupid me started right down the front rather than the side . Yes , it scraped off the algae . It also scraped up the acrylic . I did not notice until I got to the bottom of the tank and looked at the path it made . Out of the package ten minutes and my tank is scratched to all_____ . To say that I am not a happy camper would be the biggest understatement in the world . I have a product to get scratches off the outside of the tank . I have no idea how to get scratches off the inside of the tank .	-1
This medicine is very hard on the marine fish.i even half dosed them n that was to much.I am switching to pima n melafix.I hope this will do it .	-1
I ordered this for my lab , but took a closer look at it , I noticed that her food was going to get stuck in it because of design flaw .	-1
It looks cool but it does n't make for a lot of fun . It dumps out almost the entire chamber of treats at one time , which makes it pretty much a waste of money . It 's over and done within in just a couple of minutes and then does n't really hold further appeal . I do n't recommend this for any dog . There are much better toys .	-1
This treat ball does not work well because the treats just fall right out . It takes my dog about two seconds to get it all to spill out on the floor . The hard sides are a disappointment . This manufacturer make a different one called the Hol-eee Treat Ball with soft sides that takes longer for the treats to come out . My 85 pound dog loves it and brings it over for me to fill up repeatedly . The Rockin Treat Ball is not worth buying . The Hol-ee Treat Ball is . The Hol-eee Treat Ball has been very durable and we have had it for maybe a year now .	-1
I recently read an article written by an exotic veterinarian who had removed 3 kidney stones from a ferret who was eating this food.Read this and decide if you still think you should feed this to them : http : //www.voernatuurlijk.nl/forum/viewtopic.php ? f=75 & t ; =9185 & sid ; =6f6d0b84d8f473bd02038de2e2f20764 # p136466I think pet stores should educate buyers on just how exotic these animals are , because really they should be eating raw food or live animals every day . Achieving a balanced ferret kibble is not realistic and a good ferret owner will be spending around $ 25/month to feed their ferret what they need .	-1
I purchased this to replace a supposedly smaller container of a different brand , only to find when it arrived that this was even smaller than the one I already had . Description of the amount this holds was very misleading - this is a small unit . Ended up returning and buying something else locally that I could verify the size of in person . Also disappointed with the seal on the lids - not as well done as I had hoped , and did not like that the lids were not both hinged to stay on . Amazon was , as always , outstanding about the return .	-1
I just returned from the Vet and a bill of $ 589 to try and figure out what is wrong with my cat . All of this started 5 days after treatment with Kirkland Flea and Tick Control for cats . We are new to this area and were told that since our cat is an outside cat to treat for ticks . I 'm not sure if this is the problem but the Vet is looking into it . The cat slept all weekend and did n't eat or drink . So today into the Vet we go . We are waiting for the blood tests and the X-rays showed no masses . After a day of IV liquids , he seems better but still wo n't eat or drink . Maybe he is full , but we tried boiled chicken and he never has turned his nose up at this before . So we take him back in tomorrow . If it turns out this product caused our cat to suffer , I wonder what other stuff stores are selling that are hurting our animals or us .	-1
I , like so many others , was so excited about Costco cheap flea treatment.But it 's SO MUCH liquid , and messed up my kitty 's fur for almost a week . Gross.And THEN , four days after I gave her this juicy treatment , she was sitting on my lap , and I found a flea on her neck ! I had noticed her scratching since I treated her , but figured maybe she had old bites healing or something.I 'll be taking that crap back to Costcto , it SUCKS . Never again .	-1
I recently saw this at Costco and figured why not give it a try - as their products tend to work just as well as the name band if not better . We got this one put it on the dogs every month to the exact date . It just did n't work the dogs were itching like crazy and then took them to the vet to find out that they did in fact have fleas . The vet then gave an oral treatment for the fleas and now I have to treat my house for them as well .	-1
I wish I had read all of the negative reviews before purchasing this product . I used it on my cat one week ago . He hid and would n't eat for two days . His fur fell out in clumps where it was applied , his skin was inflamed for days , and has now turned into a scab . To top it off , he still has fleas ! It does n't even work .	-1
This product is not safe . I am under the impression that Costco no longer sells this product for reasons I can only imagine . I guess you get what you pay for . I think I will stick to Frontline and Adavantage in the future.I do n't think Costco will guarantee products purchased on Amazon.And perhaps seller should fix typo - flea rather than fllea . Yeah . . .	-1
I am sooo glad I read the reviews on this before I used it ! I have an elderly cat who is FIV positive and has some liver issues . I bought this to use on her , my other cat and my dog . After reading the reviews , I promptly returned it . I noticed that the lady behind me was returning an opened package , so I asked her if she used it . She said that her dog had a terrible reaction and died a week after the application . Also , if you look closely at the dog flea and tick control , it says to keep cats away from your dog once you apply the medication . I ca n't imagine what it would do ! Do not buy this stuff !	-1
My 3 dogs have been eating this formula since it was introduced.. Prior to that they ate the original chicken formula . We opened a new case and fed a can to the dogs mixed with their kibble . They would n't touch it . Tried several more times to feed them this and they refuse to eat it . Maybe Halo changed their formula , do n't really understand as dogs usually knock you over to get to Spots Stew . Switched them to Simply Nourish canned food and the dogs are eating once again . Over the years the original Spots Stew went from being a real stew where you could see chunks of meat and squash , beans , and pasta . Now it resembles a paste . I was sorry to see the change as we pay a lot of money for this food at least twice the price of other food if not more .	-1
High price & my 4 cats were n't happy w/it . Better than a store brand , but I will stick with EVO , FUSSIE CAT , & other grain free that my cats like & warrant the high price $ ... .	-1
This is a pate , and the last 2 cases I got , the contents was a watery mush . Contacted Halo and they replaced , but the replacement cans where still not like they use to be .	-1
I do n't hate anything or I would have given these one star . Have tried at least 6 different brands of piddle pads . These do nothing . If pet tinkles on them it goes all the way through and runs off the edges too . Just makes a big mess . Awful !	-1
The same thing that makes this wireless fence an attractive alternative to an actual fence ( or a buried wired/invisible fence transmitter cable ) -- the wireless transmitter -- is the principal downfall of this device . Its coverage area is essentially circular ( from the omnidirectional transmitter antennas ) , and my lot is essentially rectangular ( well , wedge-shaped ) .Bottom line : the coverage pattern is too wide too effectively contain my dog on my yard . Add to that the dog in question ( a stubborn , sneaky , exuberant young adult Weimaraner generally unconcerned with corrections when he gets focused on his urges ... ) and this is a product that does n't provide a worry-free alternative to positive control on a leash . Your dog and your experience may vary , but mine were n't so good .	-1
We have a large dog who unfortunately loves to visit the neighbors dogs and jump into their ornamental ponds . He is a very shaggy looking dog , and our vet called him a beast even as a puppy . We were worried that someone would mistake his energetic play behavior as aggression . Being in a rural environment with deer , squirrels , and other critters he is awesome at sounding the alert.His personality is intense and high energy , while being deviously smart and willful at times . The problem with this wireless fence is that he learned the boundaries very easily but also learned how to run through the fence . So he would hear the tone and then Bolt through it being shocked all along the way before clearing the other side and to freedom . Even the highest setting is no deterrent . We have resorted to keeping him tied up after a neighborly visit told us he had scratched their car ! ! ! Yikes ! ! ! Other negatives ? - battery life is pathetic on this collar . You will have to switch batteries every other day or so . Gets tiring.- spotty wireless signal . I 've saw him take phantom shocks while being well within the boundary . I felt this made his manner more nervous and I feared he was terrified of these phantom attacks.If I was asked for a dog fence recommendation , I would not suggest this wireless system . In fact , I am writing this review after ordering a in ground fence and collar system . Our neighbors all have such systems and with great success ... I hope it proves more reliable then the disappointing havahart wireless system.-	-1
My back yard is fenced in with a 6 ' cedar fence . My Dobie , Max , can only see what is going on elsewhere by looking through the small spaces between the fence boards . I figured that I could put this wireless gadget around the front yard area of the fence where one of the gates is located . Max is of the short haired species so I tried to follow the instructions and use the short prongs that were alleged to be included.They were not . So , I set it all up with the long prongs which did not thrill my Dobie in the least . After I hooked him up I worked with him in the back yard for a while so he could get used to the collar . He is an inside dog and does not wear a collar except during his daily walks and other leashed activities.When I felt that he was ready for the outside of the fence I opened the gate , he saw a squirrel , took off like a bat out of hades after the squirrel , went way out of the wireless zone , gave a tiny flinch for the jolt and then came back to me with a smirk on his face . This Dobie is over 100 pounds in weight and is a member with honors of the canine branch of Mensa . He received extensive training similiar to that which I received at Parris Island . The jolts did not bother him in the least and since we have an abundance of squirrels , rabbits and cats he immediately learned to ignore the tone and/or jolt.I ca n't say whether the shorter prongs may have made a difference but I am seriously dubious so I did not pursue the aquisition of them . One of the reviewers had an unpleasant experience with Havahart customer service and life is too short for that kind of aggravation . Based on my experiencce with this item it is clearly not for Max . So if you are considering a purchase you may want to read all the reviews to be able to make an informed decision .	-1
I have 3 of the bark collars , but these batteries do n't fit two of them . I was very disappointed in this product .	-1
these are at a good price but do n't seam to hold there charge very long I have used other batterys that work better	-1
I have a very difficult , strong cat to pill and this one did not work for me . I just could not direct the pill past his tongue and he spit out the pill . This syringe has two methods to push out the pill : the usual plastic plunger and an air piston . Unfortunately the air piston slows the ejection of the pill , just enough to give my cat enough time to block the pill . So I gave up on this and use a simple plastic-plunger syringe piller .	-1
I tried using this and the pill kept getting stuck or the pill fell apart . The rubber tip came off a few times . : ( Did not like this at all .	-1
I have to give my cat a pill daily . The first piller I started with works well , but the tip of the syringe got stretched out , and would not longer hold the very small pill , so I ordered this one . The tip is much smaller , but the plunger is badly designed , being both too narrow at the tip and too short to push the pill through the opening slits . I ended cutting the tip off by a quarter inch to allow the plunger to push out through the end and release the pill . Now it works sort of okay . But I will continue to look for a better design .	-1
I 'm posting a second time because Amazon denied my first review I suppose because it was not a raving 5-star review . I used no obscenities and I 'm pretty sure I wrote more then 20 words . However , I was very dissatisfied with the delivery of these pill guns ( I ordered two ) . They had NO wrapping or packaging at all . How am I to know if they are new or not ? Both were not as much as wrapped in bubble wrap and no directions were included . Can I add water in the syringe with the pill ? I guess I can . I assume they are clean too . I 've never used a pill gun on a pet in my life . A few instructions would be nice . I 'm now watching YouTube videos to see how other styles of pill guns are used . I hope this review is posted . Not all reviews are going to toot the horn of something sold on Amazon , and as a longtime customer , I expect more respect.UPDATERUBBER TIP STRETCHES AND NO LONGER HOLDS THE PILL AFTER A FEW DAYS OF USE .	-1
We did not purchase this shock collar through Amazon for their advertised ( approximately ) $ 80 bucks , but instead spent $ 155 at Petsmart . ( Right there I feel cheated already ) . We bought this collar in November for our 4 month old Bull Mastiff . She loves to dig up flowers in the yard and has a problem jumping on people when they come over ... not to mention jumping up on our glass back door . We wanted to train her to ( obviously ) keep down and to stop the destructive behavior of digging . Needless to say from the moment we purchased it it has never been a strong enough shock . Here 's why I know . First , when we have it set at 8 ( +2 ) ( High ) and hold the button , she will shake her head-proving she feels `` something '' but nothing enough to warrant her to quit . Second , my parents own a Petsafe rechargeable collar that we borrowed over a weekend . We shocked our dog with a setting of 2 on their collar and our dog let out a yelp and immediately quit digging . We used their collar for 4 days and all you needed to do was show our dog the remote shock button and say `` no '' and our dog would n't even need to get shocked-she was too scared she would . She behaved perfect ! We bought 8 more batteries for ours and change them constantly and it still does not let off a good enough shock to get our dog to do anything more than shake her head . Very , very disappointed in this product . Please , spend the money and buy the rechargeable collar-I know it works !	-1
We use it but its too long and our dogs get tangled everyday . we have shorted to the maximum . The idea is perfect and just what we wanted but it is simply a inch or 2 too long . Its a shame . Frustrating . Heads up other buyers .	-1
I loved it when I got it and at first I had published a 5 star review , but unfortunately after a little bit over a month of use , this got broken . I decided not to purchase silicone bowls anymore and order a fabric one instead . See customer pictures that I attached as a proof .	-1
MY BACKGROUND : I own 5 cats : 2 outdoor , 3 indoor . Range 3-7 years old and are healthy . They tend to have similar taste in food . I felt the ingredients listing and the Meow Mix being & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; was a positive compared to other similarly priced wet cat food . I 've been doing a lot of research on cat food after working at a forever animal shelter where I constantly hear of clients with cats and dog developing food allergies.FOOD LOOKS LIKE : I can clearly see & # 34 ; shrimp & # 34 ; in the seafood flavor . They look like little fake shrimp dyed bright pink.SHRIMP LOOK FAKE ; CATS LIKE IT -- BUT ALLERGY WARNING : Most of my cats liked the food , only a little more than other wet food similarly priced . The reason for my 2 stars and large disappointment is that one of my cats has appeared to have an allergic reaction . I 've seen reactions a lot at work . The skin problems developed shortly after the full switch ( it was gradual ) . Since the switch back to his usual food , his skin has improved some and has stopped getting worse . Before he had opened sores and hair loss . Now , they are healing and his fur is growing back.I 'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF RELIABLE INGREDIENT & NUTRITIONAL FACT INFORMATION OF PET FOOD . This food should be held to the same standards as mine . I would be willing to make that investment in my pets .	-1
This collar is gorgeous but is so stiff that it is uncomfortable . My dog scratches his neck constantly with it on . I 'm very disappointed because it is so attractive . I 'll try washing it with fabric softener and post an update if that works ...	-1
This litter pan is exactly what I wanted for inside my cat 's bigger box , and I would have given it 5 stars , except that it is not blue ! The title and description say that it would be peacock blue -- - too bad the product that arrived is beige . Not a big deal you may think -- - after all it 's only a litter pan.I wanted a small blue litter pan to go inside the navy-colored big litter box that is located in my blue bathroom . If I was willing to settle for just any color litter pan I could have gone to the local discount store and bought one there.Perhaps aesthetics are not important to you , but I just wanted to tell other potential customers that what you see is not necessarily what you get .	-1
They are way too small , and after few minutes it comes apart . My dog chocked on it , and i tossed the rest out .	-1
MY DOGS WONT EAT THESE AT ALL STILL HAVE A FULL BAG,50 WAS WAY TO MUCH IN A BAG.SHIPPING IS TO HIGH	-1
I bought these thinking they were made in the US . They are labeled as made in china . hard to find made in US treats .	-1
Finally gave up on this product only because my cats did not like the litter box used with these liners . They are expensive and my local Target store stopped carrying them . I went back to a traditional clumping litter so overall it 's now more cost effective .	-1
UPDATE : Later on 7/25/13 : I finally got a call back from Amazon customer service . They are going to try replacing the order from a different warehouse . This seems reasonable to me . Someone else had the same issue but we are both from the same warehouse and the rep gave me the choice of waiting a few days while they investigate the cause or having them ship out the replacement from a different location in case the issue is isolated to the warehouse.I think this is a great way to think outside the box . The worst thing that can come of it is that I end up 1 pack closer to a full 10 ! *********************************************************************************************************************Original review : I had to order a single pack for $ 12.50 because Amazon was unable to fulfill my subscribe and save order when I was out . The nearest store that sells these is 2 hours away.Today my order ( pack of 10 ) arrives at my office at 7:15pm and it is a huge box of air pillows with 1 pack of pads in it ! At this rate it is going to be cheaper to drive the 2-hours than to keep staying late at the office waiting for UPS to show up whenever they want to deliver 2-day packages that do n't contain what they are supposed to . ( UPS will be hearing about that ) Apparently Amazon STILL has a problem with this product and their systems are n't noticing that their packages only weigh 1/10 of what they are supposed to . It would seem to me that as automated and smart as these systems are that they would kick packages out for human inspection that are that much over or underweight in the name of customer service .	-1
Worked well at first application . Killed all aiptasia that I put it on and did not seem to effect my fish or coral . First application no side effects noticed . In two to three weeks some of the aiptasia came back killed 2nd time now they keep coming back every few weeks but fewer each time I had 10 now 4th time of killing , I now have 3 aiptasia , I have not seem any effect on fish or coral.From Oct 2012 to Jan 2013I killed two more today it controls but need to do every few weeks not a cure may need to keep this up forever ?	-1
Broke within 6 months , the connections were flimsy and the screws stripped .	-1
It is slightly smaller and much more narrow then expected . My kittens love it but my larger adult cats avoid it . It wobbles to much and is not steady it 's not even on carpet it is on tile flooring . I just recently bought it and tightened it as tight as I could as soon as I bought it , but it is already loose . Unfortunately it is no where near as dependable as my previous cat tree from Petco . I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
I received this yesterday . It was nicely packed and relatively easy to lift . The tower comes with a diagram and list of parts . Okay ... really ? Go Pet Club . Could you not at the very least put a sticker on each component designating A , B , C or L or whatever ? ? ? The piers are close in size . Apparently it 's unwise to guess -- as I sadly learned that L was not the piece it appeared to be from the diagram . You have to take a tape measure to be sure you have the right one . I learned the hard way and after putting two sections on -- was frustrated beyond belief and gave up . While you are screwing and unscrewing to change your errors , it 's a bear to manipulate , and the material sheds like crazy ! I have not finished assembling . Will have to tackle again on the weekend , but in eyeing the size of those platforms , am not even sure my fat cats will fit - they seem rather small to me . Hope I do n't have to end up sending this back . We shall see.Update : I have finished assembling . It is really small and awkward for my large cats to maneuver . It also wobbles and makes me extremely nervous . I am betting at least one of the top tiers is broken within a month . Hope my cats do n't get injured . What a disappointment . UPDATE : Have had this for 3 months . The stairs are a joke . The whole thing is hardly maneuverable for my 3 big lanky boys , and the 2 girls avoid it . It shakes/wobbles and collects fur . The old one I had was much more stable and this one makes me very nervous . I 'd never recommend this . I wish I could have my old one back . Sadly it was discontinued .	-1
unfortunately the tree is not sturdy enough to warrant the cost . It wobbles when the cats jump up on it or even walk on it . None of these cat trees seem to made that supports its construction . I did keep it because the cats love it . They do n't mind that it 'll fall apart any day now .	-1
My dog is a 6 month old lab , about 40 lbs . And these sticks vary in length , most are about 2 to 3 inches long . All sticks are about half inch in diameter.When I gave my dog about a 3 inch stick the first time , it disappeared in less than 10 seconds . I thought she had dropped it or something . No , she had bitten it and swallowed it in less than 10 seconds ! The second time , I watched her and tried to get her to bite it - which she was doing , but it went down too fast.I do n't think it 's meant to go down that fast . The sticks are hard , but brittle . I think they 're not designed well enough . I 've given my dog these sticks over a week now and they always disappear too fast . In case you 're wondering about my dog , yes she does eat fast usually . But never this fast . E.g . For rawhide bones about the same size she takes about 15 to 20 minutes to chew on those . Not 10 seconds ! In any case , they do n't seem to be making any difference in my dog 's breath.I would n't recommend these at all .	-1
This probably does eliminate germs but it takes lots of them to do one cleaning ! They smell nice and keeps my girl from licking her paws , but if I use 10+ everytime she digs , it is too costly	-1
This is a very nice product but the execution is off a bit , i would be nicer if there was a power cord for each color . also the power supply is probably not adequate for continuous operation with moonlights and such . that being said my power supply died after about 3 days and the lights would barely come on . Thank goodness for Amazons awesome return policy .	-1
Had just over 30 days . Light went dim and the moon lights started flickering . This is my 3rd light from Finnex and was very happy with the other 2 , so I bought a 3rd . Unfortunately I can not return it now . I wish I could get an exchange ... ... . : (	-1
This led light is not very well made . Entirely from cheap plastic.I bought this from Amazon warehouse and it arrived on time in a very rough original packaging box because it has been opened and returned by the previous owner.However , I do n't think the Amazon warehouse people tested the light thoroughly and just repack them and sell them as & # 34 ; used-very good & # 34 ; condition.I turned on the moonlight effect and it started blinking non stop.Right there an then I realize this unit is defective.Sending it back right away tomorrow morning .	-1
I ordered the Drinkwell Outdoor dog fountain and received an indoor small capacity fountain that had a cat pictured on the box . The directions stated the product was for indoor use only . Not sure what went wrong with the order ... ..I set up the fountain anyways to see if my dog would even drink from it , since ( and I 'm ashamed to say it ) she drinks from the toilet . She actually did drink from the fountain , however since it is small , and my dog is not , she left a lot of water on my wood floors . The larger capacity Drinkwell fountain would be better for large breed dogs .	-1
I tried a cross species experiment by using this dog auto waterer on my cats who have been using a different type for a number of years successfully . This dispenses water that simply begs cats to play in it . Since I am their staff the cleanup job becomes mine unless I want great aunt EdIth to fall and break her hip . I was not impressed by the cheapish plastic it was made of even before my cats rejected it . My cat auto waterer is much more studier and well made . After a week of this circus the previous one came back as did my dry floor . Would not recommend it for any of my dog loving friends .	-1
Despite the Chew Guard Technology , our 12 pound Schnauzer chewed off a black fabric hand within the first hour of delivery by UPS .	-1
My boxers seem to enjoy them , but then again I have n't found a treat those two wo n't eat so I 'm not sure if that says anything about the product.The container they come in is very ineffective . it does n't really & # 34 ; seal & # 34 ; so the treats become hard and stale rather quickly . The lid is a joke . This is a major flaw.The dogs still eat them though , so for that it gets two stars .	-1
I purchased this from Amazon bc the product description said that the product was MADE in the USA . However , when I received the bag , it is clear that the treats are only MANUFACTURED in the USA - no indication where the ingredients are actually sourced from . I did some further research on the Cardinal Laboratories website but I did n't find enough information to give me comfort in giving this to my dog . With all the worry over the jerky treats currently , it just is not worth the risk to feed this to my dog . ***The company does admit in their statement about the jerky treats recall that they do make the jerky treats in China ! So I would not be surprised if these treats are also made there . ***	-1
My fussy dog rejected this treat completely . I was disappointed because it sounds good to me , but we frequently disagree on favorite snacks .	-1
If you have a small dog , do n't bother . Maybe these would be more useful with a large breed dog that can scarf one of these down in half a second , but with a medium to average dog , they are simply the wrong texture and consistency for fast paced clicker training . They are strangely hard and chewy , and my dog needed to stop after each treat and take at least ten seconds to fully chew the treat . If you are at all familiar with clicker training that relies on mere seconds of response time , you can understand what a great hassle this can be.They smell strongly of bacon , but neither of my dogs were especially & # 34 ; crazy & # 34 ; about them to begin with . I would not purchase again . On the plus side , Amazon refunded my order .	-1
Upon receipt that evening I opened the can and fed to our two dogs . They ran up to their dishes with their usual excitement of dinner and as they stuck their noses into their respective dishes they slammed on the brakes and backed away.I was really surprised ! I am not used to dogs turning up their noses at canned dog food . When they realized this was it and after about 10 minutes of hemming and hawing they ate it but picked at it.When you see it come out of the can it is n't a very good looking food and when you read the label you understand why . The best way to describe , the ingredients are the by-products of the by-products with some other crap thrown in . I can not recommend based on my dogs review .	-1
Seriously , for the money go for the Fat cat Kitty Hoots Big Mama 's Scratchy Box . This Crocodile one is a joke , way too small for even my 12 lb cat . Would never purchase again and feel like I wasted my money . Unless you have kittens , this will be too small .	-1
It 's a nice idea but if you expect your puppy to just start using it , think again . My pup would run as quickly as possible away from the Pet Park . She is used to going potty on the grass and did not take at all to this product - preferred to use hard floor . Additionally , the Park was too small for her in two days ( when she was 16lbs ) . It may be good for small dogs that get trained to use it , but does n't really work for medium to large breed pups .	-1
First Impression : Pricey for What you Get , which is essentially a plastic tray covered with AstroTurf that drains to a smaller , internal plastic catch bin ( 10 '' L x 10 '' W x 3/4 '' D interior ) .For clean up , you have to clean the AstroTurf , the larger drain tray & the catch bin . You are going to get your hands dirty.And then there is the training . I wanted my older , female dogs to use the system ( even tried putting a potty pad on the Astroturf ) . They were a no-go even though they pee daily on outside grass . On the other hand , my male dog had no issues with the system - he snuck into the room twice , lifted his leg made a mess.So , given the limitations of the system ( 1 ) made for small , female dogs or puppies that do n't yet lift legs , ( 2 ) the clean-up factor , and ( 3 ) the price , I am not impressed with the system . It is easier and cheaper to stick with potty pads & doggie diapers .	-1
So this has become a lackluster piece of scenery around my home . My dachsund , Dobey , who just turned 6 this month , has been paper-trained and potty-trained since a pup . He goes on paper when we are n't home or at night if we 're asleep . So after he did n't understant this or my attempts to put it in his potty `` spots '' , I even put his papers on it . Nope . He 's like `` huh ? '' He just wo n't go on it at all . At one point I had to take it out of my daughter 's room where she was using the pee-collection drawer ( never used , mind you ) , as a secret hiding drawer for her jewelry , lol . I have tried for months with a no-go . I think perhaps this might work best on a puppy if you start training him/her right away from day one , but not my dog . Not recommended by me . Too much money for the average buyer ( mine was free , but even if my dog did use it I think paper would still be easier ) . Also , as I said you would probably have to start with a puppy to get them used to it , and that 's quite a step up/down for a little pup , so paper training would still be easier and cheaper imho . Not recommended . The concept is a good one though which is why I definitly was eager to try this .	-1
The Pet Park is sturdily made , of three easily hosed down pieces : a grassy mat , a frame for the mat , and a sliding tray to collect any dog urine the park attracts.PROS : The little lawn is really pretty . The plastic grass has a good texture , is smooth and soft ; it 's even a bit luxurious.CONS : My dog uses the pretty little grassy lawn to sleep on.Since the pet park is ostensibly set up for my pet to do his urinary business , I would appreciate him peeing on it . He already has other places to nap . : - ) I did pour water into the grass to see how the unit worked . The liquid seeps into the plastic middle level , which is angled with a hole to direct pee into the bottom tray . The tray is not very big . This is clearly not intended for many sequential uses.When I pulled the laden tray , I had to move carefully to dump the fluids without spilling any . I also found the middle layer would retain some liquid , and that it would drain out after I removed the bottom tray . So there is a learning curve to not get peepee on the floor at all.Dealing with pet poop is simpler . The dog is supposed to poop on the grass mat , which you can pick up later with a baggie for disposal . I am sure if it occured to my dog to poop on this , that would be great.Not all dogs understand about grass , because not everyone HAS grass for their dog . Some city dogs eliminate on sidewalks . Some peoples ' yards , like here in the desert , are of gravel or xeriscaped flora.To entice my dog into peeing on this mat , I imagine needing some sort of marking scent to spray on it . I would have to do some research to find such a thing . I know wee wee pads come impregnated with it . Or I could embark on a new potty training program.And for leg lifting dogs , could a post of some sort be jerry-rigged ? This all seems like a lot of effort for a product that intends to make my life simpler.For dogs that are used to squatting in the grass , I think it 's worth giving this pet park a shot . Keep in mind that the pee catching tray is rather small , and that not all of the urine might make it down to that level without jiggling the park around first .	-1
The PetZoom Pet Park Deluxe dog relief system seemed like our answer for constantly having to use pee pads . Our dogs are older and sometimes ca n't hold it overnight or while we are away . They do go on the pee pads , though . And we never really had to `` train '' them to use those . They naturally took to them . Unfortunately , like many other reviewers , we just could n't get our dogs to use this . One big design drawback is that the base is plastic and does not have any grippers are anything to keep it from sliding on our wood floors . Therefore , any little bit of pressure causes it to slip sideways just a bit . I think this is something that really turned off our little , old dogs to it . I tried putting on my own adhesive rubber feet , but the corners of the PetZoom plastic tray do n't all have a flat spot to be able to stick the grippers . For the price of this , I would expect to have included some sort of method to get it to stay put on solid floor surfaces . Even when I was able to get it to stay in place , I still could n't get either one of our dogs to try it.I agree with a previous reviewer , that it is a pretty little grass mat for our dogs and cats to nap on , though .	-1
Since I have access to a steady supply of dogs through my friend who runs a rescue organization , I figured her charges could put this contraption to the test . When one runs a foster home there are bound to be accidents and for her this is no exception . So she tested this on four small dogs . Below is what we both liked about this product and what we did not like : LIKES- There is no assembly . Just remove it from the box and ensure that the grass sits on top of the platform with the tray underneath . There are only three pieces to this unit ( a platform , waste tray , and synthetic grass ) .- The platform is sloped slightly to allow the urine to drain into the hole that leads to the drip tray.- The pegs on the platform should prevent most of the urine from sitting up against the grass as it drains through to the waste tray . However , that only works if they go into the middle of the unit as the grass sits up against the platform since the nubs are flatter around the outer edges.- This is sized for small and medium sized dogs.- It does not take up too much space ( 25 inches long x 20 inches wide x 2.5 inches high ) and can be used indoors or on a balcony , porch or patio.- The three pieces can be cleaned with warm soapy water ( see dislike about this three-piece system below ) .- If the dogs do n't use it at least it can be used as a sleeping platform or scratching area.DISLIKES- None of the dogs could be trained to use the grass ; instead they sniffed it , slept on it , scratched on it like a cat would a scratching pad but never went to the bathroom on it.- My friend and I consider this expensive . In fact she said the price is too high . For me I feel it is an expensive solution for what essentially acts like a flat litter pan with grass and drip tray . However , I do agree that IF IT WERE TO WORK , it exists to direct all `` accidents '' to a certain area so from that perspective it might be worth the price because all that wayward urine and feces is not destroying another part of the home.- We both felt it was too complicated to clean because it is a three-step cleaning process ( the tray , the platform and the grass ) and you probably would have to have access to an outside hose unless you wanted to clean it in the tub . In fact , my friend felt it would just be easier to clean the floor because that is a one-step process.Being that my friend has a lot of experience with dogs , I have to defer to her with regard to what is dog typical . She said `` they are used to the real grass . '' She even used a soiled piece of paper towel and put it under the grass so they would sniff and go and use it but none of them did . Based on the failed test with four small dogs , I 'm rating this 1 star . That does not mean it will not work for you . I do think that if someone has exhausted all their options , it might be worth considering since it seems ( based on some reviewers ) that a few dog owners have had success with this unit . I suppose if you bought it and they did not use it for what it was intended , it could be used as a sleeping or scratching area . In our experience that has been its only redeeming quality .	-1
I have to give this item a thumbs down . We have two 6 year old beagles who I thought might use this on rainy days instead of going out , or maybe at night . The box clearly says `` Good for older dogs , too ! `` , but I completely disagree with that . My dogs were n't the least bit interested in trying it , and in fact , since they chew so much , I 'm very worried about them taking off the artificial grass and chewing on it and choking . It it not secured to the `` waste tray '' at all.You might consider this if you have a puppy , but hopefully you will be able to find some instructions on how to train your dog to use this . There are no instructions whatsoever in the box , and the outside just tells you how to assemble it ( it was very easy - I 'll give it that ) and at the very bottom of the box , in tiny print , it says `` Find out more '' and then gives their Facebook page . Very inconsiderate of anyone who may not be on Facebook . I would think for the price of this item , a few tips on training your dog to use the system would be included.I can not recommend this item at all - first because I feel there are safety issues with the grass not being secured and most dogs chew things , second because my dogs would not use it and third because no training tips were included .	-1
This was not at all what I expected . It looks good on the surface , but the `` pee '' area is considerably small . If you take a good look at the picture , you will see the small tray that slides out for you to empty . The `` grass '' area drains into a sub area which is the size of the `` grass '' . That area funnels into the small slide out tray . If you decide to get this product , it should definitely be for a small dog and you would likely have to empty it frequently . If you are using it for an all-day thing , you may want to put something under it , in case of overflow . You might also consider putting a couple of Bounty paper towels in the tray , to help absorb . ( Bounty absorbs well ) . The pull out tray is not very deep , so pulling out a loaded tray could get yukkie . And , you would have to constantly wash this thing out or it would get nasty fast.BTW -- My 10 pound toy poodle sniffed it and walked away ( even with the spray ) . She will have no part of it whatsoever .	-1
I feel bad for having to say this , cause really , it 's a great idea . But I have three dogs , and I could not get any of them to use it . One dog even uses a potty pad , but when presented with this , she merely sniffed it , laid on it , and proceeded to try to chew bits of the fake grass . Not a single dog showed any interest in pottying on it . I 'm going to try again one day when there is a mega blizzard ... Perhaps when their little bladders are fit to bursting , they can be convinced to use it , but I doubt it . I think one may need to buy those special sprays that tell a dog to potty here ( I know they have sprays for NOT pottying . ) I think it 's a great idea , but also , upon further examination , I wondered why one would n't just use a potty pad . At least with a pad , you can just pick it up and throw it away . With this , you have to pull a tray full of nastiness out and wash it all with soap and water and that 's a big gross . For that dog that wo n't use a pad , though , I can see this coming in handy . Sadly , it did n't work for mine .	-1
This seems like a good alternative to the traditional puppy training pads . I decided to test it out with my daughter 's new Boxer puppy . She had been using the puppy training pads but they get expensive and I do n't think Bruiser was understanding that he was supposed to be going potty outside when the opportunity was presented . He would be taken outside and do nothing and then go back in the house and immediately use the training pad to do his business ! The PetZoom Pet Park Deluxe seemed like a good solution . My thought is that Bruiser would associate the synthetic grass with real grass outside . We took it out of the box and put it in the spot where he used the traditional training pad the most . We started by putting a regular potty pad on top of the synthetic grass because he was used to the regular pads at that point . He sniffed around it for a minute and then pawed the regular pad off the Pet Park . We tried a few more times . Then we removed the traditional pad and threw it out.Next step was to catch him as he was urinating on the kitchen tile , grabbing him midway and placing him on the grass of the Pet Park . He stayed and finished his business but did n't seem happy about it . After a couple of hours we went to see what he was doing . He had pulled the synthetic grass top off of the Pet Park and was chewing it ! Thankfully he did n't ingest much . I doubt that plastic is great for his system.Here are the problems with this `` system '' . The synthetic grass pad is not attached to the base in any way . It just lays on top . I thought about double face taping it down but any dog could still paw or chew it off and the tape would deter the urine from going through the holes down into the catch pan . The other problem is that the holes in the grass are NOT really big enough and there is a certain amount of urine that gets trapped in the grass mat and it DOES smell . The third problem is that you need to empty and wash the catch pan often or it smells as well . You would think they could incorporate some kind of charcoal filter system but then that would increase the cost with having to replace the filters.I do n't really see this as a training tool . I can see it for someone with a small dog in an apartment building but even then I would rather just wad up and throw away a disposable training pad then have to empty and wash out a pan of urine every day . And this product does nothing to deal with the issue of poop . Good idea but maybe they need to go back to the drawing board with this one .	-1
The tray is a lot smaller than anticipated . The tray is also wobbly and therefore makes the dog uncomfortable to use it . I have not been able to get my dog to use the petzoom even with the & # 34 ; frequently bought together puppy training aid & # 34 ; .I bough some sod and put it next to the tray . She will use the sod . We tried putting sod up on the tray but the wobble still bothers her and she will not use it regardless of the sod .	-1
I really like the concept of the PetZoom Pet Park Deluxe system . It would be especially good for heavy pee-ers . However , heavier dogs may not be comfortable stepping onto the plastic system . My dog is about 18 pounds , and she jumped off of it because of the noise and shifting that her weight caused . For smaller dogs , I think the regular pee pads you can find are much better . I have found a brand that does n't leak for my 18 pound dog , so I would assume that smaller dogs would be fine with a pad . It may be a pain to have to throw away the pads and keep purchasing them , but I will continue to do so since my dog is afraid of the system . She does have some unusual fears , so it could just be her . My friend 's poodle does n't like to go out when it is really cold , so I may see if she wounld want to try it out .	-1
After trying two different brands of pads for my older dog to use if I am gone for more than a few hours , I was pleased with this product in that my dog has used it once , which is one time more than she used the pads ! She has never been a dog who had accidents in the house except when she became ill , so I have no idea how this would work for a dog with `` issues . '' It is easy to set up and easy to clean . Due to the configuration of my house , and the need to keep two cats away from the dog when I am gone , the PetZoom does take up a little more of the available space than I would like , but that is a small sacrifice . I think it will be really useful in the winter when ( and if ! ) it snows , as I can put it on the enclosed patio and take her `` outside '' to use the system . UPDATE ( 10/27/12 ) : My dog still has only used it the one time , and that seems to have been by accident , so to speak . I am consistent in the use of the word I use to tell her to `` go , '' and when I point to the Pet Park , and use our word , she furrows her brow and shifts her eyes to the left , as though she ca n't believe what I am directing her to do . Her reaction is very cute but obviously I am not getting the results promised by the product so I lowered my rating to 2 stars .	-1
We have two dogs and two cats . All are housebroken but , when we 've been gone for a lot longer than we had planned , there have been accidents . We had tried using the Wee Wee Pads , but half the time they ended up shredded and the accident had occurred somewhere else . I had seen the infomercials for the PetZoom Pet Park Deluxe 3-Piece Dog Relief System and do have a couple of friends who have one and love it , so I was hopeful that this would work for our two dogs.The product is very easy to put together . There is a large black tray with a slightly sloping bottom with an opening in the middle for waste to drain down into a removable tray . A plastic grass pad sits inside of the large black tray . It came with a pamphlet that included tips on how to train you dog to use this product . After three weeks of using those tips and information we found online , neither of our pups will use this for bathroom purposes . We have had to move it out of our lab/retriever 's way since he thinks the plastic grass makes for fine dental floss . Our other dog , who has anxiety problems , refused to even go near it because of the sounds it makes when she tries to step on it . Though both dogs are larger sized dogs , both had enough room to use this for going to the bathroom . Unfortunately neither of them would use it even after weeks of treats , using sprays supposedly to attract dogs to use this as a potty , and various methods of training.Pros : * Easy to put together* Easy to clean* Easy to remove waste trayCons : * Expensive* Not a product all dogs will use* `` Grass '' pad slips off the base too easily , which could cause injury in older dogs ( or kids who accidentally step on it ) * The plastic smell is very strong for a few weeks after removing from the box . It was so strong that we had to let it air out outside before trying to train the dogs to use it.In the end we gave up trying to get our dogs to use this after several weeks of training every day . Our cats , however , seem to think this is the litter box from heaven . So now this potty tray resides next to the litter box . I have to say this is n't a bad situation as it has saved us quite a bit on kitty litter . The litter box and this product are used about 50/50 . This is the only reason I gave this product two stars.There are quite a few similar products on the market , and the price range is quite wide . This product , for what you receive , falls at the expensive end of the spectrum . Maybe if they had included an instructional DVD for potty training , rather than a skimpy pamphlet , training might have been more successful . This product , if you can get your dog to use it , would be excellent for apartment dwellers , elderly dogs , use during storms , etc . But for $ 80.00 this is a pricey experiment . Start out with the cheapest model you can get , and if your dog ( s ) use it , then go for a pricier model like this . Otherwise , this is an expensive item to send to the recycle bin .	-1
I bought three bags of this stuff because I am crazy . Now I am stuck with three bags of thin brown hay . My guinea pigs eat this stuff so slowly I swear they are sick or depressed . Do not buy this brand . The seller is awesome , I had an issue and it was quickly resolved , but the hay is terrible . If my piggies could talk I 'd make a video .	-1
Not very durable . One of my three dogs had it ripped up in no time . Wish that someone could please make a DURABLE interactive dog toy like this but would last more than a day ! !	-1
The squeakers are great . Well , they were for 5 minutes . My dogs were having a blast for a couple minutes until they tore the thing apart . Then it was a shredded rag . Sigh	-1
Basically head is coming off and torn in multiple places . Only had it a few months . Not worth the price . Was good while it lasted and my dog got hours of play from it . Would not buy again .	-1
We love these flat toys without the stuffing . Our Boston puppy usually ca n't tear them up , but this toy immediately came apart at a seam and the big squeaker came out . He had n't played with this toy for 10 minutes before it came apart . We have a flat fox & a white flat sheep from another company on Amazon and he 's played with them for months they are well made while this one came apart , sadly , in minutes	-1
In the battle for survival , the eight pound Papillon who envisions himself a Mastiff , one again emerges as victor by chewing through the head of the toy to remove the squeaker which he in turn ripped apart and ate the squeak . All in one day .	-1
This was ripped to shreds in minutes . Not worth it . The only advantage is that it did n't have the big stuffing mess .	-1
This gave my betta fish dropsy overnight . Google dropsy and click images to see what that is . I would not re-purchased this stuff again . Betta fish dead .	-1
Great for a puppy to a small dog . Is so cozy and safe , and my new one falls asleep the moment her head hit her soft bed inside.Uhoh , update . The zipper on the door broke last night , not sure if I can fix it , but three months is not long enough for this to last . My puppy loves it , is her bed , but tonight I am not sure what I will do .	-1
While I had high hopes for this shirt , it only made my cats anxiety worse . He did not move for hours after we put it on him and acted as though he could n't walk . I checked to make sure it was not too tight and it did not seem to be constricting him in any way . After we took it off , he hid for hours . Whenever he sees it now , he `` freaks out '' . I must say , however , that a friend of mine purchased one for her cat and had good results . I suppose it just depends on the cat , but be prepared that you may not get the result you want .	-1
I bought this for my mom 's cat because she 's been having litter box issues and just seemed anxious for some reason . In addition to adding more litter boxes and taking her to the vet , I wanted to try out the thunder shirt . The moment I put it on , the cat went crazy and was so anxious she ran under the bed and began biting on the shirt . I thought she was gon na have a heart attack . She was finally able to get the shirt off herself . I felt so bad causing her so much anxiety . Cat are different from dogs . They do n't like shirts . I do n't know what I was thinking .	-1
I used the measurement guidelines , but it still seemed too small . It was also difficult to put on because of her fur as well . I sent it back for a refund .	-1
I have three cats . Two are two years old and one is 16 years old . I got the shirt for the male 2 year old who is scared of EVERTYTHING and EVERYONE . Mailman ? Cat is terrified . Garbage day ? Cat is terrified . ( three times as we have three trucks every Tuesday ) Car ride to the vet or pet store ? Cat is terrified . Thunder ? Lightening ? Cat is terrified . When it is just the family at home watching TV cat is fine . He plays with his sister and the older female cat . ( Torments the older cat but we protect her from him most of the time ) When the vet recommended Lavender I tried it . No improvement . The vet recommended the Thundershirt and after a year of nothing else working I tried it . Small was to small for my little guy who is 9 pounds . The neck was huge but the Velcro barely managed to hold around his chest and he looked like he was in a sausage wrapper . It caused him to pant since his lungs were being compacted . I exchanged it for a medium . Neck was even larger which was not good . The chest fit better but it did n't help . He was still shaking in terror at every little thing . I tried it on my female cats ( the older one did n't seem to care and the younger one ( scaredy cat 's litter sister ) is so laid back all the time that I think she just figured I 'd take it off eventually which I did . I gave it three days for the male . He never warmed up to it and indeed started to get terrified if I simply picked it up in the same room he was in . I returned it . My quest continues ... . I did include 2 pictures of him wearing it about 4 minutes after we put the medium size on him . He was still baffled but not terrified of it yet . Sigh .	-1
We had several people try to get this on our cat but she scratched one and bite another . So my conclusion is our cat needs something better to calm her down .	-1
The measurement says the small shirt should fit cats up to a 13-in chest circumference , but my cat with a 12 '' circumference did not fit.She fit in the medium version I got for my fat cat , and it does make them much calmer and it fits better than the version for dogs .	-1
I have four dogs and one of them just loves to bark at anything . She will bark at the neighbors , cars driving down the road , to even leaves falling down from trees . It is not a soft quiet bark either , it is one of those loud pitch barks that hurts your ears . I have tried using a using a water squirt bottle , a metal can full of rocks and a citronella spray collar but those are just temporary fixes . I can not go squirt water or shake the can at her when she is running around outside barking , and once I remove the citronella collar she knows she can bark again . When I saw the Havahart Remote Trainer I thought it was the answer to my prayers , boy was I wrong . All my pooches already wear collars since we have an invisible fence . They are all trained and know the boundaries very well and never even attempt to run out of our property . I thought this collar would use the same concept or approach since the invisible fence collar gives a sound warning and then give a slight shock when they are too close to the boundary line.First I notice that the collar is really cheaply made , I was having problems putting the battery cover back on the collar and was worried I was going to break it since the plastic tab the holds it in is so thin and small . It states the collar is water-resistant , but I highly doubt the receiver is because of the way it is constructed . After programming the collar , I really thought my dog was secretly laughing at me . When my dog starting barking I gave her warning sound that did not even phase her . After several failed attempts of the sound warning I tried the static correction on level one and nothing . I increased it to level two and still she kept on barking . By the time I got to the highest level and she was still out there barking loudly at the wind and I gave up.This did not work for me at all . I will mention that the dog I using it it on was a 15 pound Chihuahua short-hair mix . If anyone out there has any other ideas for bark control , please let me know in the comment area - it would be greatly appreciated .	-1
I had high hopes with this unit . I imagined that those times when I take the dog out on our property without his leash , and he wants to run off into the cornfield beside us , I could just click and he would stop running ... That was n't the case.This collar does n't effect our dog at all . He is a 13 month old Pit Bull who is at normal weight for his age . The audible warning made him look around a bit as if to say `` What was that '' but it did n't stop any unwanted behaviors or make him pause at all . The actual `` shocking '' did nothing for him either . I guess the `` shock '' is n't strong enough on this unit . You could see when the button was pushed there would be a very slight twitch in his neck , but it did not stop him at all . He kept on doing what he was doing as if nothing ever happened.The collar itself seems very cheap . The nylon is thin and flimsy . The plastic buckle is less than desirable . The set does come with training cards which are useful with training in general and they also give you precise instructions on how to incorporate the collar into training . There are 2 sets of metal probes for you to get a good fit/connection on your dog.I wish I had some better things to say about this trainer , but unfortunately it was a dud for us .	-1
I have used the Havahart Remote Trainer for a few weeks now , only for correction of bad behaviors . Upon opening the package , the build quality and materials feel very cheap . I mean VERY cheap . The remote uses very light and frail feeling plastic . It feels as if dropped , it would certainly break apart or even shatter . The collar feels a little more heavy duty , but still not up to par when compared to my other electronic collar . The engineers who designed this product also confuse me . Why on earth did they make the power button on the collar microscopic ? The on/off button is sooo small , why not make it a little larger ? Also the battery compartment on the collar itself requires a coin to open . For the price I do not recommend this product . For the rest of the details , just read the description of the product . I do not recommend this electronic collar by Havahart .	-1
This Remote Trainer would be a good idea if it actually worked ( I also own the Havahart Fence Free Containment System and had similar issues there ) . Havahart can not seem to get their act together and test their units prior to selling them to customers.The unit does not stay linked together and I have to relink after every connection or audible alarm . I contacted Havahart directly and they replaced the unit , but the 2nd one did not work either . So Havahart is easy to work with - as long as you 're within the warranty period - but they just ca n't seem to get me a functional unit .	-1
This DIY containment system definitely beats paying thousands for the Invisible Fence . However , the trouble is getting a unit that actually works and Havahart can not seem to get their act together and test their units prior to selling them to customers.I got the main unit to work , but the collar was not functional . Replacing the batteries did not work either - there was no blinking light or reaction to the fence . I contacted Havahart directly and they offered to send out another collar , but now I have to send mine back , wait for them to receive it and then send out a replacement . More hassle than it 's worth ...	-1
It says right on the box some dogs will not respond to ultrasound . Mine did n't . I 'm pretty sure if you bought it from Amazon it can be returned for a full refund . Still , I would make sure you know what the return policy is from wherever you buy this from . Many sellers , even Amazon , state shipping charges may not be refunded unless it is broken or defective . In this case , the unit is not either ; it just does n't work on my dog ( pembroke welsh corgi ) . I would hope they make an exception based on the fact the product admits it may not work . Good luck .	-1
I have a 4-year-old Cockapoo who in the past 3 years has developed a bit of a barking problem . I 've tried everything I could to stop it short of more work with a trainer . I was curious about a device that would help stop barking but did n't want anything that would hurt my pet , so this product seemed like a good solution . I liked that it would n't hurt my pet and that it could be set up in automatic mode so it would respond to him whenever he barked without my manually having to use the device.At first , it seemed to work reasonably well . I watched the device and it did a good job of picking up on when my dog barked , even when he was straight across the room . I also noticed his ears perking up when the device went off . It usually would n't stop him from barking completely , but it would distract him long enough that I could sometimes interrupt him and get him to do something else . Over time though I do feel like he 's gotten used to it and thus , it seems to become less and less effective . It 's possible that it has affected the barking slightly but not enough , unfortunately that it is noticeable .	-1
This product does state that it does not work on all dogs . It did not work with my dogs . I read the directions and followed them step-by-step to test all the frequencies with my dogs . Even while sitting close , my dogs were n't phased at all . Or , if they were , it did n't stop them from still barking at the neighbors cats - which is the bain of my dogs existence . And the purpose of ordering this product . Very disappointing , I really wanted this to work !	-1
