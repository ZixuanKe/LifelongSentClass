As with most WordPress books , I simply wish for more technical details . Id like more programming examples and ideas for troubleshooting . I know what to do when things work ! But they do n't always work . At least not for me ! Still , one of the best -and only- new books out there on the subject . I keep seeing more in depth books being promised do perhaps WordPress writing is turning the corner .	1
OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook is one of these modern marvels when a person can acquire a book for mere $ 30 ( or so ) and build a career with it ! Thanks Packt ! And I assume one would get a very good living . These skills are very much in demand . So a big thank you to Kevin Jackson putting so much insight and effort into creating such a fantastic book . Indeed , the Cloud made quite a lot of buzz lately , and keeps doing so . With the prices per feature falling rapidly it is no longer a brainer Cloud 's adoption is accelerating very fast . Luckily , it is very much possible to build an enterprise grade or even your own cloud ( even on your own laptop ! ) . The OSS community and many for-profit companies work day and night to make the Cloud more resilient , affordable and flexible . OpenStack is probably the most bolding one out of these . But it requires a good training as the aspects of creating and maintaining one may seem intimidating at the beginning . It is thus very advisable to get yourself equipped with a good companion as the OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook.So , first things first , the book most probably is not targeting newcomers to the Cloud field or recent grads , but I may be wrong . Be aware though that the book is quite dry and spends a lot of time settings various bleeding edge technical things up ( on Ubuntu and some Windows OS ) . I state the reader should be familiar with some basic bash commands as awk and sed , networking concepts , database , virtualization and storage to rip full befits of the material covered . Another note is regarding the hardware , you would only be able to fully cover everything discussed in the book if you had a decent machine with plenty of storage and RAM . I did not see anywhere exact specs mentioned , but I imagine a MacBook Pro or a Ubuntu machine with 16 Gb or RAM and 500Gb of SSD/HDD free should do just fine.Those who have enough programming and/or administration skills under one 's belt will be greatly rewarded from reading this book . At the same time this book is a good guide on how to maintain properly just any environment up . E.g . monitoring events , react to issues , troubleshoot , remedy storage mishaps , monitor queues and databases . Plus more . Everyone benefits.While reading this book , somewhere towards the chapter 12 Monitoring , right after & # 34 ; In the Datacenter & # 34 ; I started to realize thanks to this book , I now have a better understanding what is going on behind the scenes when I click on provision new cluster or allocate a new VM in the cloud as an end user . Total coolness ! After finishing reading this book I am under an impression it must be bought both , in print and electronic forms . One should lay down on your desk because the last two chapters about the monitoring and troubleshooting would be the one you want to skim through first upon getting an issue to tackle . And the ebook should be on your mobile device ( in case you get a trouble call or want to reply to an IRC message and need some reference ) , plus it allows easy copy-pasting into terminal or just in case you want a quick Ctrl-F ( search ) in your PDF reader for some information.Verdict , this is a hard to beat book in both quantity , quality and coverage , so a 5 out of 5 is warranted !	1
I read Tout Sweet when it was offered for free on my Kindle . Well I could not wait to read more of Ms Wheeler 's writing . She brings the French country side to vivid life . I have never traveled outside of the USA but after reading Tout Sweet and Tout Allure , I feel I took a vacation to the village of Villiers ! And I was even more happy when I saw that she had also written a third book , Tout Soul . I purchased all three paperbacks and plan to place them on my book shelf to re read as I do all good books . I am reading Tout Soul at present and I am reading it slowly for I hate to end my time with Ms Wheeler .	1
I love a good gossip , and this book is full of it . What lives these people lead ! I doubt that they can appreciate their money and pampering since they have never known anything else . With the exception of the Queen - poor lady , she seems to do her best with her silly relatives - I ca n't help but find most of the Royals to be beyond quirky . I wonder if they could `` make it '' if they had to deal with the reality of most peoples 's lives . I can see Charles as a clerk in a shop but not much else . An interesting read , though , if you like that sort of thing as I do .	1
This was an interesting book to read , but it really did n't share any dirty secrets and that 's what I bought it for . It did give me a quick peek into the royal family and their quirks which I thoroughly enjoyed . If you are fascinated with the current monarch then you wo n't want to pass this book up !	1
Rob Sanders has quickly and unexpectedly become my new favorite Black Library author . I loved his compelling tale of treachery in `` The Long Games at Carcharias '' in the Victories of the Space Marines anthology and `` The Iron Within '' was the best short story in the Age of Darkness collection , a collection that boasted some truly stellar work by the biggest names in the Black Library . `` Atlas Infernal '' does not disappoint , telling a harrowing tale , large in scope and finely detailed.There seems to be a trend amongst the Black Library authors , who seem to make a conscious effort to avoid major established characters and events of the 40K canon . I ca n't fault them completely , and the HH series has alleviated a little of my desire for big and important events/characters but it would still be nice to read about the 13th Black Crusade invasion of Cadia or the first Battle for Armageddon . Rob Sanders makes a bold move for only his second novel writing for the BL . He poses Azhek Ahriman , Arch-Sorcerer of the Thousand Sons and well established character as the arch enemy in his story . And it pays off . `` Atlas Infernal '' has it all , inquisitors , eldar , Death Korps of Krieg , a Deathwatch killteam , Savlar Chem-Dogs , traitor guardsmen , Grey Knights , daemons , a techmarine of the excommunicate Relictors chapter , a daemonhost , a rogue trader , Rubric Marines , and more . There is enough material in this book for a whole series and what could easily bog down a reader makes for a thrilling time . The novel is very fast paced and there is a good deal of action and problem solving . The prose is also a degree above the usual BL faire , Sanders is a fine wordsmith.Inquisitor Czevak himself is a character the reader will grudgingly come to love . He is hundreds of years old , and all that experience provides a resourcefulness that is more dangerous than any physical weapon . The supporting characters are perhaps a bit thin but they have potential to become very deep in future entries to the series . The inquisitor 's retinue is a diverse menagerie , all damned by their good intentions . I would particularly love to see more development with the warp-seer Epiphani Mallerstang and the Relictors techmarine , Torqhuil . On another note , though Sanders only briefly touches on Azhek Ahriman he paints a convincing image of the treacherous sorcerer . Another big draw to the book will be the depictions of the eldar for any of their fans out there.The action is very well written and diverse , with an emphasis on problem-solving over endless bolter and chainsword slaughter . It does seem that perhaps Czevak has the answer any problem and this can be a little grating , but the counter argument is that he does have hundreds of years experience and an extensive knowledge of the Eye of Terror . I 'm sure it will be a very humbling moment in future installments when Czevak does n't have a solution to the problem and I 'm eager to see that.The plot is tight , but for a few minor problems . There are several intermissions that throw off the pace of the book a little and may confuse readers at first because of the time distortion . Czevak 's quest for revenge against the inhuman and insanely powerful Ahriman is compelling . The torture Czevak endured under Ahriman has realistically effected his character and it shows throughout the novel . `` Atlas Infernal '' is by no means perfect . There could be a bit more in terms of characterization and some parts of the plot are a little thin . The character of Czevak , however is solid , the action is stunning , the set pieces are unique , and the prose is fantastic . My best piece of praise for Sanders is to compare this book to Ian Watson 's Jaq Draco novels , books that were crazy and strange and altogether unique . I ca n't wait for Sanders ' next novel .	1
Yes , be forewarned this book is extremely confusing , but it really is good.The story itself is insanely convoluted and confusing . Then again the main character was in the hands of one of the most insane Traitor Marines and tortured . So sanity is n't something that was n't expected from him afterward . And even before that , having been injected by the meme virus , a 40K virus that makes you addicted to knowledge [ I wonder if I have it ; - ) ] where the withholding of knowledge drives you into fever and insanity ... ... yeah it is confusing.BUT the actual story line that is covered was great . An insane mix of protecting the Imperium of Man and equally insane desire for revenge and hatred . What could you wish more . Personally one of the interesting books in the Warhammer 40K universe . It might not appeal to everyone , and not everything make always sense ( blame chaos ) but still a good read .	1
Lots going on most of it gets explained in the end , if you read warhammer very good if not I do n't know if you could follow it . I enjoy the Salamanders	1
Continuing with the Warhammer 40,000 read-a-thon I now introduce you to my favorite new blood in the ranks of Black Library publishing , Rob Sanders . It takes a real talented author to pen a short story that will hold my attention and so far Sanders has written two that I would not hesitate to call my favorite short stories of all time . `` The Iron Within '' in the Age of Darkness anthology and `` The Long Games at Carcharias '' in the Victories of the Space Marines anthology . It 's a short list but he sets the bar . Sanders has also written two 40K novels , Redemption Corps an Imperial Guard novel that I consider his weakest effort , and Atlas Infernal a fun adventure that is best described as Doctor Who in the 41st Millennia . Now Sanders has turned his attention to where his skills are best displayed : the space marines . This is Legion of the Damned.In the wake of a haunting red comet follows the Cholercaust Blood Crusade , a vast fleet of traitors , savages , pirates , and cultists sworn to the Chaos God Khorne . The sole motivation of the Crusade is death on a galactic scale . The only thing standing between the Crusade and Ancient Terra is the severely depleted 5th Company of the Excoriators Chapter space marines . A company led by Zechariah Kersh , almost unanimously hated by his Chapter for failing in the field of battle.The first thing that you notice when you start into Legion of the Damned is that it has a slightly different flavor than other 40K novels . Do not be alarmed . All of Sanders ' works are like this . It 's a good thing . As good as the established authors of the Black Library are , it almost seems as though they are adverse to risk taking in their writing . Sanders , on the other hand is n't afraid to hazard the occasional leap of faith . Sometimes the story stumbles because of this , but it always recovers and in the end reward is significant.Legion of the Damned is an extremely character fueled novel . Events unfold from a few minor perspectives but the focus largely rests on Zechariah Kersh , Scourge of the Excoriators . Never in all my 40K reading have I found a character so despised by his battle brothers as Kersh . To be honest , at the start I did n't even like Kersh . Yet as the story progressed the Scourge began to earn my respect as he earned the respect of his Company . There are some very interesting relationship dynamics in Legion of the Damned . From Kersh 's association with his serfs to his bond with those under his command you find a space marine of multiple layers . The aspect of Kersh I found most endearing of all is how truly he represents the Excoriators Chapter of space marines . The Excoriators are warriors of attrition , their battle honors go all the way back to the Siege of Terra when they were still considered Imperial Fists . Excoriators deny the enemy victory at all costs , despite the loses , and it is this ideal that Kersh symbolizes in flesh and steel.The Excoriators Chapter is very , very cool . The history of the Chapter dates all the way back to the Horus Heresy . These guys have been around since the beginning . As far as I am aware not much had been written about the Excoriators prior to Legion of the Damned so Sanders uses this to his benefit to craft a unique fighting force . During a competition at the beginning of the book readers get to see what sets the Excoriators so far apart from the other descendants of the Imperial Fists.The fighting in Legion of the Damned is visceral and intense . I am a sucker for sieges and the battle for the cemetery world of Certus Minor is no let down . The Excoriators 5th Company is seriously undermanned and with no hope of reinforcement they must make every death count as millions descend upon the world , hungry for their blood . There is no shortage of death and carnage here as the 5th Company faces everything from daemons to traitor Imperial Guardsmen and , of course the most reviled enemy of all , the Chaos space marines.The plotting is all very well paced , and clocks in at a satisfying 400 pages . Sanders spends just the right amount of time on world building , character development , and action . Legion of the Damned has its fair share of bolter-porn but deftly avoids sacrificing storytelling to fit it all in . The whole story wraps up in a bitter sweet sort of ending that successfully mirrors the themes of the book as well as the 40K universe as a whole.Now on to the one very minor complaint I do have . If you are not a Warhammer 40,000 fan to begin with this might be considered a spoiler but to anyone else it wo n't be . Still , please read on at your own risk ... Potential SpoilerThe Space Marine Battles series tend to feature a single space marine Chapter during a major conflict that has been touched upon in 40K lore but never really fleshed out . Fans will know what the Legion of the Damned is and as such they should know that their actual presence is minimal . I 'm cool with this because of the nature of the Legion of the Damned but I really feel like the Excoriators deserved to be the featured Chapter . Granted , this would n't have been nearly as likely to sell as many books but still . The Excoriators are just so cool that I would have loved to see Kersh on the cover , wielding a gladius and a falcata-style chainsword.Potential spoiler over . Legion of the Damned is a great read and further evidence that Rob Sanders is a force to be reckoned with . If you would like a great character driven story about shame and loss , redemption and hope , space marines fighting against all odds , then this is right up your alley . *The magic Goatfairy grants Legion of the Damned by Rob Sanders , 9 out of 10 cheesewands*Nick Sharps , Goatfairy Review Blog	1
This is indeed the 10th volume of the Space Marine Battles Novel . It is original in several ways , but also not original at all in others.One of my first reactions was that , yet again , and just like Angel of Fire , this book was about an Imperial army spearheaded by Space Marines that attacks a planet corrupted by Chaos and seeks to reclaim it for the Empire of Mankind . Yet again , they make planet fall and attack the main and huge city of the planet , here called Shardenus Prime.However , there is where the parallel stops . Instead of being commanded by Lord Macharius , the undisputed leader of the Imperial Army , the commander is Rauth , Captain of Clan Raukaan of the Iron Hands . The imperial Guard and their commanders are under their orders , and somewhat resentful because of the way the Iron Hand commander uses them in a rather callous way without bothering to explain his decisions and the threats that they are facing.The originality , however , is that the Iron Hands , despite their valor , are depicted in a way that makes them hardly sympathetic . Sympathy , approval or any human feelings , seem to be almost totally absent from their behavior . Rauth and his brothers simply do not care for humans who are there to be used as canon fodder , freeing up the Iron Hands to accomplish what the others can not do.Another interesting feature which , while not original , is nevertheless well done , is to tell the story from multiple perspectives . We have that of the Iron Hands , but also that of the Mechanicum with the interesting character of the `` female '' ( to the extent that such a term means anything for a Magos ) Magos Ys , of the Titan Princeps , of Nehata , the Lord Commander of the Imperial Guard and of Heriat , the General-Commissar who is his second in command . We also have the perspectives of a couple of humans from Shardenus , one ready to do his duty and die for it , while the other is ready to do whatever it takes to stay alive . Finally , we have the imperial assassin-spy , sent ahead to stir up trouble within the besieged city and kill the enemy command , if necessary and possible.I was particularly taken in by some of the twists displayed in this book . There are no real heroes , not even the Space Marines themselves . At one point or another , all of the main protagonists behave in a questionable way so that it was difficult for me ( not to say almost impossible ) to find any of them really likeable . Another twist is to make the Space Marines into `` Super-Machines '' , rather than the usual `` Super-humans '' ( or `` Post-Humans '' ) that have become closer to the Mechanicum than they are to normal humans . A third is the importance of the representative of the Mechanicum , with Magos Ys in a position to command the Titan Battlegroup but also forces loyal to the Iron Hands , if necessary . In fact , you get the impression that Magos Ys 's role is somewhat equivalent to that of Heriat the General-Commissar , except that she is probably much more powerful.The battle scenes and the enemy are much less original . While good , the depiction of grueling battles against contaminated humans , Daemons and so on definitely have an air of `` d & eacute ; j & agrave ; vu '' and are rather standard , although I am not sure to what extent or even whether the author can and should be `` blamed '' for this . The climax - the last battle at the top of the highest spire of the highest and biggest hive - is also not very original , and you know how it is going to finish almost before it starts.Nevertheless , this was a good read , with the original twists compensating somewhat for what it essentially a variation on the theme of the planetary assault to reclaim a strategic planet infested by the forces of Chaos . For me , however , this is not one of my favorite Space Marine BAttles Novel and it is only just worth four stars .	1

Ravenwing is the brand new book from Warhammer 40k writer Gav Thorpe and is the first of a new three book series called The Legacy of Caliban Trilogy . The book is also a sort-of sequel to the other Warhammer 40k book , The Purging of Kadillus that I reviewed a few weeks ago . In this novel we follow Brother Annael ; a new recruit to the Ravenwing . The Ravenwing are a group of Dark Angels that are above the usual Space Marine . They ride around on giant motorcycles and land speeders and are usually used as reconnaissance for the Dark Angels when they are fighting battles or chasing down their foes . However , unknown to Annael until his acceptance into the Ravenwing , they are also used to hunt the Fallen , the evil Space Marines who turned on the Emperor during the Horus Heresy and killed their own Patriarch- Lion El'Johnson.When a distressing signal is received from the planet of Piscina IV , the Ravenwing are sent on the hunt for a powerful Fallen Librarian . The Librarian manages to ` turn ' the leader of the Dark Angels on Piscina IV , Grand Master Belial , ( from The Purging of Kadillus ! ) and makes him doubt his faith in the Dark Angels , forcing him to kill himself and his brothers . However before his death , Belial leaves the leader of the Ravenwing , Grand Master Sammael , a message directing him to the infamous pirate Space-Port of Port Imperial . When the Ravenwing arrive at the Port , they find that the pirates have formed a cult around the Fallen Librarian and fight a fierce battle to protect him from the justice of the Dark Angel Inquisitors as he manages to flee . However , the trail is not lost and the hunt is still on as the Ravenwing follow the mysterious Librarian to his lair where more of his loyal and corrupt followers fight to the death to defend him.This was another good book from Gav Thorpe but I honestly did n't enjoy it as much as The Purging of Kadillus . I do n't know why this was , I think it might be to do with the fact that The Purging is a Space Marines Battle Novel and was really fast paced , full of battles , action and all in all , for someone like me , a great book to get into the Warhammer 40K literary world . Ravenwing on the other hand , is the first book in a series so perhaps was not going to be as fast paced as the one-off Space Marine Battle Novel . I also did n't enjoy the characters as much as I thought I would . I think that this might be because I 'm not that big off a fan of the Ravenwing as a unit anyway- which probably explains why Telemenus was my favourite character ! Nevertheless , saying that the novel was n't fast paced and then reading it in 3-4 days might seem a bit contradictory . Do n't get me wrong I did enjoy the book but not as much as The Purging and I 'd suggest that you read that book before you read Ravenwing . Nevertheless , I am looking forward to the next book in the series Master of Sanctity ! For more book reviews google adam-p-reviews !	1
The recipes are classic . There are the perfect amount of photos too and their quality is just as it needs to be . The quality of the paper could be improved upon . this book has a good feel and a clear point of view . the layout is perfect as are the classic recipes . I like the cabbage soup recipe and the baby leek vinaigrette . The rabbit with prunes is tasty too . Ah ! and for dessert , try the chocolate chestnut tart . One of my favourites is the roast chicken with herbs and lemmon . There is a little bit of everything for everyone in this book . I appreciate that each recipe takes one page and that there is a photo of each recipe . I think that this almost needs to be a standard . This book should be shared with friends .	1
This book is not just all about flowers , frills , and pretty linens , and trinkets . It is about those things , but not only about them . In a more broad definition of the word `` romantic '' , this book delivers on a sense of idealism and adventure . Bright colors are sometimes mixed with soft , as are dark and neon . Mod style is softened by frills , chandeliers made less pretentious by the addition of craft birds , and in general the whole fluffy , girly word of romantic style is made less saccarhine and uptight by a more casual and eclectic approach to the genre . If you are looking for rose infested decor and only that , then do n't buy this . If you are looking for something more adventurous and daring , then buy Ms. Lake 's romantic offering , and get lost in `` romance '' .	1
The hilarious adventures of the couple whose marriage was saved by the zombie apocalypse wrap up in Eat Slay Love . It continued to be funny and intelligent . It gave surprises and still felt familiar . I do n't think a better conclusion to this wonderful series could have been written . The topic of the purported `` midwest wall '' was addressed in brialliant and realistic fashion .	1
Any book with the Angels in it is awesome.Wonderful story , definitely plan on reading it again.I would recommend this to any one of my Doctor Who friends . And those who are n't !	1
I read & # 34 ; Magic of the Angels & # 34 ; by Jacqueline Rayner on the train this morning and it was awesome ! The Doctor dresses up as a stage magician , wearing a frilled white shirt , a loose black bow tie , and a cape lined with red . Amy dresses up as his lovely assistant , in a sparkly silver catsuit . Neither costume fit terribly well , as if they once belonged to someone else , but it was enough to get them past security and into the theatre to save the day.There was some plot about the weeping angels , and needing to save the world , but who cares when the characters get to visit the TARDIS wardrobe room ? ( Actually , the plot about a magician using an Angel to make people disappear was quite clever , and I felt like Rory was important to the plot , as was his being a nurse , which the screenwriters did n't do enough in show . He knew what was going on ages before the Doctor did . )	1
The book is very well written . I would recommend it to anyone . : ) I love a good Doctor Who story , they always suck me in .	1
This is simply a fact book about the TV show . Unfortunately they did not go into details about the newer series . Material was presented in a dryly written way - someone amazingly spent a lot of time finding out all the facts . But did not take the time to write it out in a funny/clever way . A lot of information lists ...	1
Have you ever wanted to compare the exact differences in the various sonic screwdriver models ? Want to reminisce about the various adorable companions throughout the years ? This book has all that . It 's just great , perfect for die-hard , lifelong Who fans like me . If you 're just starting out , it 's a great way to see all the history in this amazing series .	1
Lots of information I did n't know . The Who fever which caught on recently , began 50 years ago for the world , 35 years ago for us . Great fun reliving the history and filling in the blanks .	1
The sinking of HMS Repulse and Prince of Wales on 10 December 1941 by Japanese bombers was a catastrophe for Great Britain and a lesson to one and all that battleships no longer ruled the waves . Noted Brit diver/author Rod Macdonald examines the life and combat careers of those legendary ships and their current condition on the bottom of the South China Sea in FORCE Z SHIPWRECKS OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.Sent to bolster Britain 's defenses in Southeast Asia , Prince of Wales and Repulse - part of Force Z - were sunk eight days after arriving in Singapore on an ill-fated sortie to locate and destroy Japanese invasion convoys . Lacking air cover , the two ships were swarmed over by 85 level- and torpedo-bombers and sank within two hours with a huge loss of life . With their loss , it was only a matter of time before the Japanese took Singapore.Macdonald does an excellent job of relating the overall development of British battleships and battlecruisers , the service careers of both ships , the 10 December air attack and the present condition of the ships . He is a skilled writer , the description of the 10 December battle being especially compelling . Equally compelling is Macdonald 's description of the sunken warships and the accompanying color photographs and artwork by Rob Ward . Visually the book is just fabulous.Although it lacks an index , FORCE Z SHIPWRECKS OF THE SOUTH CHINA SEA rates five stars . Its appealing combination of history and wreck diving complimented by top-notch photographs/artwork make for a great read . Highly recommended .	1
The description and function of the Five-Fold Ministry was very well described and is the central focus of the book . This is one of the books that I bought five copies of and loan out hoping they never come back .	1
This is an amazing missionary story ! I ca n't believe there are no reviews on this one yet : ) If you like missionary biographies , or just want to read an incredibly great book , read this one ! Mrs . D .	1
Refreshing to read a simple book with a fine moral in every chapter . Old fashioned , yes , but wonderful to read . Read aloud to your children and grandchildren .	1
As Shakespeare is to drama ( both comedy and tragedy ) , one might say that Wodehouse is to humorous writings . If I were to make a list of the top 10 humorous books in the English language , number one might be Jerome K. Jerome 's `` Three Men in a Boat '' , and number 10 might be Evelyn Waugh 's `` Decline and Fall '' -- all the rest on my list would be from the very lengthy PG Wodehouse oeuvre.This collection represents virtually everything that Wodehouse wrote before 1925 . It includes many stories that will be unfamiliar to modern day Americans -- only a couple of his most famous `` Blandings Castle '' and `` Jeeves '' stories are included here ( they are enjoyable nonetheless ) . Of particular interest to me were the many `` school '' stories which he wrote between 1900-1905 before he first traveled to America . These stories represent his recollection of his days at an English public school -- they are much concerned with cricket , rugby , and sneaking out of the house at night ( a pastime I myself remember fondly from my school days ) .I also found that the background to the stories gives an interesting picture of what every day life must have been like in the period 1895 to 1914 . All of Wodehouse 's stories ( which were written over a period of about 75 years from 1900 until his death -- he was working on a story in his hospital bed when he died ) are set in a pre-World War I Edwardian world there never was -- no matter how much we wished it had been.Some ( when they are down or depressed ) will turn to chocolate , or ice cream ; I , on the other hand , turn to my two favorite authors : one of whom of course is PG Wodehouse , the other being Rex Stout . No matter how bad I may be feeling , I can pick up any of these authors ' works ( no matter how many times I have read and reread them ) , and my spirits will immediately be lifted.The kindle formatting is good ; the table of contents is helpful .	1
I do n't have a Physics or Math background , and if you 'd told me 10 years ago , that I 'd buy AND read a book on Quantum Physics , I 'd have chuckled . You , of course , would have been right , because I did . I loved it and whipped through it pretty quickly.I bought this book to learn more about quantum theory . I wanted a book that was n't going to beat me senseless with heavy theoretical math , physics or formulae . I wanted a more complete understanding of the possibilities that quantum physics theory hints at , which is exactly what I got with this book . This book offers the Open-minded a fascinating overview of some of the more controversial quantum theories , the experiments that `` proved '' some of them , and what might be just over the horizon for quantum physics and for us.I found this book really worthwhile , with a positive slant that worked for me . What quantum physics seems to be demonstrating these days , according to the author , is that much of the information that we `` knew '' to be true , may very well not be . Which really does open up a world of possibility for all of us.This short meaty book is ideal for the quantum-curious . I highly recommend it .	1
I was cognizant of the historical incidents described in this book , but I did not see the relationship between these incidents and Zionism , till now.It is refreshing that this book is written by an Israeli , who we can assume intends no harm to Judaism as a religion , but he abhors any horrific act as much as he abhors the Holocaust.Ilan Pappe displays an exceptional courage in his examination of Israel 's faults before dissecting the faults of the other side . As a starting point toward reconciliation , both Israelis and Arabs should engage in significant introspection of their own actions , as did Mr. Pappe in this book.I disagree with Pappe 's analysis that the existence of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Palestine is justified , because both parties display actions for which he is critical of Israel . The dream of peace ca n't be served by actions of the Muslim extremists of Hamas and Hezbollah , nor by the actions of Jewish extremist .	1
I teach German and I incorporate the story of the White Rose into my curriculum . I have read Inge Scholl 's book , the McDonough book , and seen both films ( The White Rose , 1982 ) and Sophie Scholl : The Final Days . This is , in my opinion , the best of the books and complements the films by adding a lot of new information that I did n't know before . I especially liked the attention paid to the other members of the group after Hans and Sophie were caught . Everything I have read and seen puts all the emphasis on Hans and Sophie , with Sophie receiving the most attention due to the fact that she was the youngest member and the only woman . The other 's contributions and fates tend to be more glossed over . This book is the only source I have found that goes into detail about the others , which I enjoyed and found very helpful and which , quite frankly is owed to them . I highly recommend this book .	1
Complexity theory can be a difficult topic to learn and there is a wide body of literature with varying descriptions of what complexity means . Johnson 's book is a great starting point for many readers because it is conversational in tone , free of complicated equations , covers a wide range of topics and does not assume a prior knowledge of complexity theory.Johnson begins with a patient and detailed introduction to complexity and then introduces the role of disorder to build the groundwork for defining chaos , taking care to explain that chaotic does not equate to randomness when defined in scientific terms . His description of the eight key components of complexity ( p. 15 ) are particularly valuable insights for those new to the topic.An important feature of this book is Johnson 's ability to make certain core concepts of complexity science clear to his readers . Examples include topics such as `` pockets of order '' ( p. 21 ) , `` strange attractors '' ( p. 46 ) , and `` anti-crowds '' ( p. 72 ) . Yet , Johnson 's extended example of disordered files and filing cabinets quickly grows tedious . Nevertheless , for those who can endure the details , the example provides an effective way to explain some rather obscure concepts in complexity theory ( e.g . strange attractors , chaos ) .Johnson also articulates a very clear explanation for the formation and function of fractals as emergent outcomes in certain complex systems . This unique approach to explaining fractals is especially valuable for non-mathematicians who are curious about their relationship to system outcomes . Yet , because many people are confused by the role of fractals in complex systems it would have been helpful for the author to contrast the types of systems where fractals are , and are not expected to form . There appears to be considerable confusion about this in the business community and the popular press , especially related to organizations as complex systems.Another topic which often seems confusing to those learning complexity is the role of feedback , especially in the organizational context where information is the medium of exchange that alters the system . Johnson depicts a framework ( p. 26 ) of how feedback can influence complexity and provides order to a system , but fails to emphasize how feedback operates differently in a complex system , compared with a cybernetic system . He does indicate that feedback incorporates learning and memory into human dynamics but seems to suggest that feedback is the key ingredient that moves systems from order to disorder and back ( p. 110 ) . Johnson could be much clearer that complex systems do n't experience feedback as a regulatory mechanism to maintain equilibrium as seen in more traditional dynamical systems . And that disorder or emergent outcomes in complex systems are also related to other mechanisms . This is conceptually important , because complex systems are generally `` far from equilibrium '' , a characteristic that has deep implications for expected system behavior.Overall , these are minor issues that do n't mitigate the value of this excellent book , which represents an accessible and thorough treatment of complexity science at the introductory level . Lastly , do n't overlook the appendix for an extensive annotated list of references and resources about complexity topics.If you found this review helpful please click `` Yes '' .	1
As a Christian who embraces many truths found in the Buddhist teachings , I found this book to be an insightful and courageous exploration of the boundaries and interrelationships between these two sacred traditions . A profound book .	1
This book deserves a 5-star rating for its content . I devoured this book from cover to cover , because this was a message , I felt , that came from the heart . But it 's deeds that convince more than words , and Mark Boyle 's simple descriptions of his experiment in living without money for a year is very moving in parts , inspiring in others , even to most of us ( if you are like me ) who have no intention of changing lifestyles so radically . Wherever one stands on the I-love-our-planet spectrum , there is something that everyone can take away from it . Definitely worth reading .	1
This is a good book to get an understanding of the chaotic conditions that take place in Afghanistan . Very similar to the Vietnam conditions with insurgents and counterinsurgency and the problems without enough troops to occupy every town and village outside the main strongholds of the US and Afghan armies . Corruption appears to be rampant as in Vietnam . We take and hold an area for a brief time only to pullout and allow the insurgents to move back in after our departure . The lack of commitment of the ANA to actually fight and win . Almost an impossible venture . This is another reminder of how difficult it is to invade another country with ground forces regardless of the reasons . There will always be homeland guerrillas who can outlast the invading armies and threaten the locals about what will happen once the & # 34 ; invaders & # 34 ; are gone . Afghanistan has proved this over its many years of history .	1
I do not seek out the easy to read , nice friendly stories that assure me the world is all peachy keen.Rather I enjoy ( in a twisted way , I suppose ) reading of other people 's problems , tragedies and misfortunes . I do it with the intent to glean lessons from the story , and add them to my mental checklist 'What to do if I end up in similar SHTF moments'.I recently read & reviewed 'The Almond Tree ' by Michelle Cohen Corasanti . I had mistakenly believed it to be a memoir - which it is in fact a fiction piece . Yet I believe these two books should be read - one following the other ( which ever way you chose ) .Both books take place , in large part , in the same geographic location ; however told from the other groups ' point of view.David Harris-Gershon 's 'What Do You Buy the Children of the Terrorist who Tried to Kill Your Wife ' is a stunning , heart wrenching , educating , anger-inducing , peace-wanting read . And an actual memoir . Which I do prefer to fiction to a degree.While I wear many hats in my life , this book made me put work and recreation aside ; I lost sleep and cried from time to time.Originally I was going to give this book a 4 star rating because I wanted to know more about David 's interactions with the terrorists ' family , following their initial meeting and I longed for him to actually meet the Mohammed face-to-face . Alas , this did not happen , such is life ; and I decided to give 5 stars simply because of this reason . The ending of the book leaves me wanting to know more of his personal story . Did Jamie ever meet other family ? Do David 's children know of Mohammed 's children ? Did the prison system ever own up to their actions , or lack of ? Was that conversation truly the end of contact with the cab driver ? And so many more questions which can only spoil the story and remove some surprises.A read worthy time and tissues .	1
This is a very unique fashion book because it does n't just show pictures of the fashions ( which would be fine anyway ) It takes it a step further by showing the individual details of the clothing worn in that period . Very interesting I always find this kind of research help from books i buy from Amazon.com .	1
Wow ! Those pictures ! I found myself wanting to run to a museum to see textiles and incredible fashions like these .	1
I love reading about the history of jewelry , and I have an extensive collection of books on the subject . This is a book that I would rate solidly middling . It 's good , but it 's short and has a fairly small profile ( meaning none of the pictures are as large as I 'd like ) . A while ago I wrote the Victoria & Albert museum asking if they 'd ever reprint their earlier book on the subject , and was suggested this one instead . Unfortunately in comparison , this work is just a pale imitation . I would suggest that if you 're really into the subject and have several books on the subject , this would be a fine edition . But if you 're only going to read one book on the history of jewelry , or medieval jewelry , this one should n't be it .	1
The writting is somewhat dull and uninspiring , but the color photos and examples shown are good . If medieval jewellery is your thing , or you would like a nice medieval jewellry book to round out your reference books , this volume may do it .	1
I rely on all my Navarre commentaries to help me understand scripture but never so much as in this oh so difficult to read and understand final book of the Bible . Our modern culture has lost most ( all ? ) of the background needed to translate this book from confusing to enlightening . This Navarre give it back .	1
Overall a good read , but you might be better instructed on wearing the Kilt on youtube . I ordered this book and it was shipped from the UK- took a bit , but got here in excellent condition . The cover has changed . Some things are mentioned , and no illustration for it , and some things are just not mentioned at all . Is it worth your money and time ? Yes it is . However this is not an end all like some might think it 's the beginning .	1
THE ILLUSTRATED ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ESSENTIAL OILS by Julia Lawless When is an oil not an oil ? When it is an essential oil . Really the term essence seems more appropriate . Those tiny little vials termed essential oils are really the pure plant parts with nothing added , usually obtained by some kind of distillation process like steam . It takes a lot of plant to make a little bit of essence . Be careful not to leave the lid off because they evaporate ( ever see an oil evaporate ? ) A plant 's essence can help to heal us , calm us , or make us happy . Different plants contain different oils that do different things . These oils used separately or blended together have powerful physiological and psychological actions . Julia Lawless brings over 150 essential oils and the plants they come from to life as she explains each plant 's chemical components and what they are used for . The individual plant pages contain not only full color photos of the plants and its parts , but also the vials of essential oils , important to those of us seeking quality oils . The therapeutic index helpful in providing a list of preferred oils for specific ailments as well as alternates if that is what you happen to have . I particularly enjoyed reading about the many uses of basil oil . I seem to have at least one need from each of her use categories ( Skin care , Circulation , Muscles and Joints , Respiratory System , Digestive System , Genito Urinary System , Immune System and Nervous System ) . As a nerve tonic she rates it A1 . I guess my body must know what it needs ; I never seem to get enough pesto .	1
In this book a professional scientist writes about religion , specifically , about Jesus . It is a spectacular accomplishment , totally honest in its outlook and impressively comprehensive in its scholarship.I must admit that I am only halfway through its thousand pages . I am not reading it rapidly , but am annotating the margins of each page , in ink ! It may take me the rest of my life to finish it ( I am 77 and I read it only on Sundays for an hour or two ) , but already I know that I will never find a more scholarly and insightful work which honestly seeks to discern the true character of Jesus . [ Note added on April 22 , 2012 : I am now 87 , and I finished reading this book years ago . I am now rereading it , and appreciating it even more for its incomparable scholarship and insight ! ] Perhaps because I share the same scientific temperament as the author , we have a common bond that unconsciously brings us together . Davidson has studied and written exactly as I would like to , provided I could commit myself to devoting the immense amount of time and energy to meticulous scholarship , as he had done.In this book the character of Jesus is incomparably broadened and sharpened by bringing in many sources that were ignored by the political and administrative forces that finally determined the content of the New Testament . There are hundreds of lengthy quotations about Jesus from over three hundred sources that were written in the first five centuries after his death . Furthermore , each quotation is rephrased by the author for further clarification.Here is an example : `` Jesus said , 'If the flesh came into being because of the spirit , it is a wonder . But if spirit came into being because of the body , it is a wonder of wonders . Indeed , I am amazed at how this great wealth has made its home in this poverty . ' '' This is quoted by Davidson from the Gospel of Thomas which is rejected by fathers of the Christian Church , for it suggests that the soul may have derived and evolved from its life in the body , rather than vice versa . I find that `` twist '' fascinating ! Frankly , I find it difficult to believe that the historical Jesus actually spoke this thought , but somehow it does not matter . The Bible is a collection of many noble , and some not so noble , thoughts of human beings , but it has been edited for `` proper '' content by many biased editors with tunnel vision.In this book many insights are given that point toward the existence and the character of the divine in human life . And I find them inspiring ! Nowhere else have I found any writing on religion that approaches the dedication and illumination of this book . Page after page I am enthralled by my introduction to many obscure and unknown writers who , in their admiration for Jesus , have put their inspired words into his mouth in much the same way as the New Testament writers have done.It is clear that I can not praise this book enough . However , it is written for the seeker , not for the believer .	1
This is an excellent book , but loaded with minor errors . I am finding 1 per page on average . Have never seen a book like this . It does n't appear to have been edited other than for basic grammar and spelling.Definitely worth reading . Very straightforward coverage of the common formulas in Astrophysics .	1
Windisch is a miller in a small Romanian village on the German border . He is busy bribing the local officials with bags of flour to get a passport to emigrate with his family . Ultimately flour is n't enough and he has to offer his daughter ... .A haunting tale where Muller tells in short snippets Windisch 's story and also that of the dismal village , wrapped up in superstitions , corruption and the constant impositions made by the totalitarian regime.The fantasy forced upon them that the Ceausescu 's are the mother and father of the nation ; its ptotectorate , I 've read only one other Muller book , and like that one ( 'Land of Green Plums ' ) 'The Passport ' is told in fragments , each sticking in your mind adding to a bigger whole.Brief outlines of Windisch 's wife and first love Katherine 's live in a Russian forced labour camp are never fully expounded on but add to the fears and paranoia about getting the passport out . As you would expect from decades of totalitarianism , you blank out the horrors just to keep on going . In this way Muller really does create the Ceausescu dystopia.Only 90 pages long , 'The Passport ' demands reading and offers up more with each reading .	1
Although Nadirs and The Land of Green Plums have now been reissued in English , when Herta Muller won the Nobel Prize for Literature in October this year , only The Passport was available for monoglots wishing to gain a flavour of her work . Fortunately , it seems to be a fine example of her recurring themes and sparse prose style . Muller was born in 1953 in a German-speaking village in Western Romania and her work predominantly focuses on the harsh conditions of life in Ceausescu 's Romania and on the persecution of ethnic German Romanians by the occupying Stalinist forces.The Passport portrays the stifling hopelessness of Ceausescu 's regime as experienced by village miller Windisch , an ethnic German who wants to escape life in Romania and so applies for a passport to freedom and the glittering temptations of the West . Drudging through his daily life , never giving up hope but at the same time never truly believing that something better is out there for him , Windisch obsesses over the passing of time and the mundane , cyclical nature of his existence : ` Each morning , as he cycles alone along the road to the mill , Windisch counts the day . In front of the war memorial he counts the years . By the first poplar tree beyond it , where he always hits the same pot hole , he counts the days . And in the evening , when Windisch locks up the mill , he counts the years and days once again . 'With local government officials running a nice sideline selling Romania-born Germans to West Germany , obtaining a passport is no easy feat . Windisch believes that his occupation as a miller will be the key to success and so he begins to leave sacks of flour outside the home of the mayor by way of bribes . Times may be hard for the poor and the ethnically persecuted , but the rich were doing rather nicely under Ceausescu and so all Windisch 's offerings of flour gains him is starvation for his family during the winter . When this first attempt at bribery fails , Windisch , blinded by his own desire to escape , sends his daughter to visit the homes of village officials.Windisch 's life is one of conflict and oppression , his village is populated by forlorn , trapped people , and the tone of The Passport reflects superbly his sense of hopelessness and despair . Of course this does mean that it is rather a depressing read , all the more so since Muller exhibits such a limited , almost stilted , use of language . Sentences such as & # 34 ; Windisch shivers & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Amalie points at the map & # 34 ; , especially when used by a Nobel prize-winner , are bound to polarise readers . What the Nobel committee referred to as the & # 34 ; frankness of prose & # 34 ; , Tibor Fischer in his review for the Guardian described as & # 34 ; With the possible exception of Dan Brown or Barbara Taylor Bradford , prose does n't come any franker than this & # 34 ; . Damning praise indeed . It is true that Muller never seems to build on her prose , she has her sparse language style and she sticks to it . However , while her style might not be to everyone 's taste , in a short , fragmented novel like The Passport it does serve well to convey the haunted melancholy of Windisch 's village and the oppressive uselessness of his situation.The dark days of Ceausescu 's totalitarian regime in Romania are as important to remember as they are horrifying to recollect ; while Windisch might be just one man , the drudgery and depression of his life are reflections of the suffering heaped upon whole communities . Muller 's greatest success in The Passport is her unnerving ability to portray with absolute clarity the dreadful hopelessness that can infect the souls of man and the ease with which government and bureaucracy can triumph over humanity .	1
A very sardonic and withering look at Post-WW II Europe , Elfriede Jelinek 's `` Wonderful , Wonderful Times '' is a book that few will enjoy reading , but one that casts a certain mordant spell nonetheless.Jelinek writes pitilessly , dryly mocking adolescence , Fascism , Socialism , existentialist writers , class structures , and of course , human foibles . Her style is aggravating , I 'd have to say , as she insists on actually inhabiting the grimy world she depicts , and not transcending it . She succeeds in conveying a kind of gestalt , a portrait of a social morass in which four hapless and somewhat stupid Austrian youths are trapped like canaries in a coalmine.Though the young characters are introduced as loutish thugs , by the end of the novel Jelinek has created sympathy in the reader.The message ? `` When you pull the plug on dreams , terrible things can happen '' .	1
Joe Boyd had a young adulthood that many of us of slightly later vintage envy in our bones . Boyd seems to have been everywhere that mattered in music in the 1960s . His youthful mid-1950s fascination with blues records , combined with his means ( an educated Northern family and an early-graduation Harvard degree that he seems to have acquired almost casually ) , empowered him with excellent , wide-ranging taste and a charmingly self-effacing confidence . At 21 , he organized a 1964 European blues revue and a jazz tour later that year , each of which hailed , achingly , the passing of an age in their respective musical forms . Stateside , he was the stage manager during Bob Dylan 's earth-shaking act of plugging in at the Newport Folk Festival . He is the single human being on the planet responsible for Nick Drake 's careers -- the slight one during Drake 's brief life , and the one that since 2000 has had practically every white person with a guitar claiming Drake as an influence . Boyd turns up in so many varied , now-iconic places at just the right times , it starts to feel a little like Forrest Gump , but it 's only logical : though he never seems to think of himself this way , Boyd was exactly the right person at exactly the right time , a catalytic force behind the scenes and sounds ( though he did not meddle in the artistry of those he produced ) , an instigator who was not content just to have been there . The most touching moments are when he reflects on the magic of the times , but even when he is not openly discussing it , the longing for the idyll of the time is always present as a constant , enchanting undercurrent.See his website for an additional chapter left out of the book as kind of a `` deleted scene . '' I could happily read White Bicycles 100 times , either straight through or just diving for pearls and never coming up empty-handed .	1
last year i picked up a copy of the book `` 1001 books you must read before you die . '' this book ( `` cutter and bone '' ) was included as one of the 1001. i already had a copy of it . it had been in a cardboard box in one of my closets for about 20 years . so i dug it out and read it , and , unlike many of the other recommendations from `` 1001 books ... , '' this was actually a very good book . like most noir novels , likeable characters are scarce . this is dark stuff , about unappealing people ; but interesting and compulsively readable their lives are . the story is a wild one , and the author pulls it off in an unpretentious and seemingly effortless way . i felt not a false step among the pages . it struck me as believable from 1st page to last . all in all , an outstanding crime novel .	1
While the prose is a it old-fashioned and heavy going at times , it paints an accurate picture of what trench warfare must have been like . The reality of human relationships and the realities of time in the front line and back on rest . Well worth reading	1
Fantastic noir writer , a madman himself , his works are wonderful stories of depravity , violence and a nameless detective who is a tough , brilliant man who sins often and devotes himself to the destruction of evil .	1
You might ask why I gave this book 4 stars if I did n't really like it . But , the thing is , for the right audience , I think this would be a very good book . The plot itself was solid and the main character , Blake , was engaging . My problem was that I was language-challenged . First , I ca n't tolerate too much of first person , present tense , because it really gets on my nerves . The biggest issue was that I could n't understand the slang Blake used.The story had a `` stream of consciousness '' feel which might attract some readers . ( I 'm okay with that as long as it 's 3rd person , past tense for the most part . It 's just easier to read . ) Blake was funny ( dark humor ) and witty when I could understand what he was saying.This book was definitely for some other reader and I did n't want to be unduly harsh just because of my own mental inability to understand what characters were saying . I wo n't be trying any other books by this author , but I think others might really enjoy the series .	1
This was an interesting novel set in a working class , downwardly mobile , British town called Mangel where Royston Blake , no longer the respected doorman/bouncer at Hoppers Wine Bar & Bistro , is feeling poorly . He 's rumored to have `` lost his bottle '' , meaning he 's gone soft and is n't the menacing bruiser he once was . As the late comedian Rodney Dangerfield would have said about him , `` He ca n't get no respect . '' Blakey 's believed he 's also lost his manhood with regard to his relationship with the opposite sex . To make matters worse , the Munton Brothers ( Baz , Jess , and Lee ) , as nasty trio of siblings as you 'll find in fiction of this type , delight in treating him like dirt and rubbing his nose in the muck . Blakey , though , has a plan to make a comeback , just like his hero Rocky Balboa did in Blake 's favorite movie `` Rocky III '' . He sees himself as having been knocked down , but not out . And like Rocky , getting up off of the canvas to defeat Clubber Lang , Blake thinks he can take care of the vicious Muntons and get back on top . Things , however , do n't go as smoothly as he planned . Royston Blake soon finds himself up to his thick head in trouble.DEADFOLK is the first book in a trilogy about Blake and how he fairs in Mangel . The other two are BOOZE AND BURN and KING OF THE ROAD . I will definitely read them when they become available here in the US . One word of caution to readers who may be sensitive ... Blakey liberally sprinkles his speech with four-letter-words . I was n't offended and I think that the language totally fit in with Blake 's rough to the bone personality . 4 Stars	1
I just finished Vicki Hendricks ' newest book , CRUEL POETRY , and loved it.Dennis Lehane calls her `` the high priestess of neo-noir , '' as do many others , and this book does n't disappoint.CRUEL POETRY is a tale of obsession . Renata is a South Beach prostitute , and Richard is one of her regular clients , a poetry professor who wants to take her away from the seamy Tropical Moons hotel . Her next-door neighbor , Julie , likes to listen in on Renata 's sessions through a hole in the wall , and gradually grows as fascinated by her as Richard is.Lots of sex , murder and mayhem ensue , but the book 's strength is the depthof the psychological profiles of all three main characters . They transcendtype to become living , breathing people -- and of course , the hot , steamysetting is equally strong . If you like noir , you wo n't want to miss thisbook.Neil Plakcy , author of [ [ [ ... ] ] ]	1
John Jay 's role in the founding of the United States is too often overshadowed by iconic figures like George Washington , Benjamin Franklin , and Thomas Jefferson . John Jay played a role from the trip of revolution to independence . While not a military leader , he was a key supporter to George Washington as President of the Confederation . This book focuses on the life and achievements of Jay in the context with the other founding fathers . Often times he was playing a supporting role but he was always in the fight and always interacting with the more notable names in American history.The author does a wonderful job of carefully showing the depth and breadth of Jay 's involvement in both the history of New York and that of the fledgling United States to include his subsequent negotiation of the Paris treaty . He also shows Jay 's willingness to put his country before his family.This book does an excellent job of putting many things into perspective and highlighting one of our founding fathers .	1
Stahr 's book on John Jay is absolutely first-rate . Surprisingly , Stahr mentions that it has been almost 70 years since someone has done a full biography on Jay . This makes the book all that more appreciated.In short , although Jay was not as important and revered and talked about as Washington , Jefferson , and Hamilton , he clearly played a major part in launching this nation for over 25 years , so much so , that one wonders how he slipped under the radar screen . Here goes ... .He was a member of the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775 , and was President of it in 1779 . He lead the peace negotiation in 1782-3 at Paris which resulted in a very favorable treay for the US . From 1784 till 1790 he was Secretary of Foreign Affairs for the Confederacy , but more importantly , during this most fragile period in our history when most of the members failed to attend and rotated out after one year , he gave continuity and competency to the new national government . He was the most important figure in getting a very reluctant New York State to approve the new Constitution . He was the nation 's first Supreme Court Chief Justice . He was governor of New York State for two terms . There 's more.Furthermore , everyone in his times and now agrees that he handled all these tasks with competency to a fault , being admired by friends and opponents alike . Like Hamilton , he was a person who got things done , but , unlike Hamilton , he seemed to get along with everyone.The writing and research are great . One gets not only a feeling for who Jay was as a person , but also what his place in history is . It 's not a profound book or a book that comes to new conclusions and insights , but a book that exposes Jay 's life for what he did and what he was worth . It brings together Jay 's lifelong multitude of accomplishments . From the cover jacket , the author appears to be a lawyer/novice at writing books . Great first effort ! I 'd have to say that this is probably a book for people who already know something about the beginnings of the United States and are looking to fill in the gaps . Jay was clearly a team player , and this book focuses on Jay and not the overall picture.Lastly , several years ago I visited the Jay homestead in Rye , New York . It 's a beautiful piece of land by the water . Apparently the building itself just barely escaped the wrecking ball , hard to believe . I 'd recommend a visit .	1
This was a real treat even though it took a better part of a week to consume it all . Try Baby Blue by Lloyd Albritton ... ..	1
This collection is perfect for people who are not English majors and who are suspicious of much of `` modern '' poetry . These are `` accessible '' poems that stand up well to many re-readings . It is well worthwhile to take a look at Housman 's biography on Wikipedia . Many of the poems appear in a different light once you know his background .	1
awesome translation of the holy quran I highly recommend it .I would also recommend this bookThe Qu'ran The Final Evidence They Dont Want You To KnowI say they both are must read books if some 1 wants to know more on islam .	1
I love the books , I always have . I have had the audible version before and can read them over and over .	1
'Disaster at D-day ' is a very compelling 'what if ' book , which illustrate the idea of what small changes can make to a major story . The book may read very clinically unless you are into hardcore history / military history , however since I am into that type of stories and enjoy history in general I found the book very well put together , and answered the questions of 'what if ' very well.It most likely is a best case scenario for Germany , it may not really be all that believable for many . However having read 'Rise and fall of the 3rd Reich ' I know that active opposition did exist in Germany and within the armed forces.The notes added to each major chapter makes the book read even better , as one sit with feeling of actually reading 'real ' history , and the author manage not to take sides or make one side better or more human than the other.If a 'what if ' type of story is your thing , then 'Disaster at D-day ' is a great read and highly recommended .	1
As has been mentioned , this book is written in the style of a college-level history textbook for a survey course . While the story is certainly interesting , and I enjoyed it a great deal , I 'd be concerned about recommending it to anyone due to the extrememly dry nature of the text .	1
Evgeni Bessonov took part in the Great patriotic War while he served in the 49h Mechanized Brigade of the 6th Mechanized Corps of the 4th Tank Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front ( commanded by the dynamic Marshal Ivan Konev ) . In this book he recounts many of his wartime adventures , at least as far as his memory perimtted , because the writing was made many years after the war . Bessonov was a junior officer who commanded a platoon of 12 - 20 tank riders , the men who rode in battle on top of the Soviet tanks , mainly T-34s and later IS-2s . Although he saw much action and was wounded some times he was not lucky when it came to promotion and did n't manage to command his own company . Albeit he made the Army his carreer after the end of the war . The book is important because it presents the war from the view of a simple Soviet warrior and is particularly revealing regarding the strength of the Luftwaffe even late in 1944 ( when according to history books German aircraft had been disappeared from the sky of the Eastern Front , but quite the contrary was true ! ) and of the qualities of the German soldiers , whom he regarded as tough , well trained , cunning and strong opponents , from whom one could expect anything , anytime . Bessonov started his wartime carreer in August 1943 and finished it just a week before the fall of Berlin , when he was seriously wounded fron an artillery shell . The book contains some good maps but many of the places mentioned are not to be found on them . I did n't also understand why the translator kept calling the artillery and mortar rounds as `` mines '' throughout the text .	1
This book is a good overview of the diplomatic and military defeats of the Third Coalition by Napoleon . It outlines the troubles between Austria and Prussia and how the Russians failed to react in time to Napoleons drive . Napoleon 's generals were simply able to outperform all of the participants involved . The prose is directed and easy to read . You do not really need any prior knowledge of Napoleon to read this book and for those who are knowledgeable in Napoleon this book may drag on a little at times . Overall though it provides good information and is a worthwhile addition to any Napoleonic library .	1
A lot of reviewers have been quite unnecessarily cruel to Ms Denny 's book . OK so the title is all wrong and the battle for Konigsberg does not start till 7/8 of the way through the 230 pages . And also one must admit that Ms Denny knows next to nothing about military details or hardware . Who knows , maybe the publisher forced the title on her ; the wording of the title does not seem Ms Denny 's rather chatty style at all.But if you consider the book as an introduction to East Prussia then it is a readable and interesting history of the area , its racist Prussian inhabitants and their eventual downfall . So , if like myself , you happen to have been reading the excellent Tatiana by Martin Cruz Smith where the plot is centred on the Kaliningrad region , this book provides a very good background to the city and its area.By the way , this is one of the few Russian cities to have retained it 's Soviet era name and Kalinin himself was an interesting Lenin and Stalin era stooge whom Stalin enjoyed humiliating to the n'th degree . Yet he survived to 1946 and to have a major city still named after him .	1

Romantic Wedding Cakes ( Merehurst Cake Decorating ) Chosen and commissioned by Merehurst to design and develop the first international wedding cake book , Kerry Vincent , an Australian national living and designing in Tulsa , Oklahoma , has created a work in sugar artistry for the experienced decorator . Steeped in European history and the haute couture of France , her cakes of majesty have gained her international recognition as a sugar art designer.Ms . Vincent invented the Vincent Marquetry ( an inlay technique ) which is featured on a cake-top plaque gracing the exquisite Peche Belle La Russe cake where , inlaid purple flowers brushed with mauve luster dust and other blossoms with silk-white luster dust it sits on a crown of miniature carnations . On the bottom tier , this three-tired couture-inspired cake has sumptuous drapes pleated around the bottom tier while acanthus leaves curve under carnations . They stand tall , marching around the second tier . Matching bonbonieres ( favors ) shaped as domes , decorated with carnations , acanthus leaves , tiny violets and trips of sugar-silk ribbons enhance the cake design.Another invention is the unique 'organza sugar pleat ' featured on the Simply Pretty in Pink cake . Seamless strips of rolled fondant folded and wrapped overlapping around the cake are confined by pleated ruffles with molded buttons which have been brushed with red pearl luster dust.With her artistic vision established in tradition , Ms Vincent presents several cakes in the architectural majesty of the European past . Simpler to create than most , the Stylish Satin Sugar Roses model is wrapped sugar-satin roses which stand in a molded-sugar vase that tops an elegant five-tired cake embellished with 150 acanthus leaves brushed with antique silk luster dust and anchored with roses . The Breathtaking in Brides Lace cake , a majestic testament to the institution of marriage , reveals Ms. Vincent 's dedication to bringing the highest standards of design and workmanship to her art . This four-tired dramatic architectural form , a tribute to Christian Lacroix , is wrapped in lace , draped in sugar-ribbon , and adorned in swages that are secured with lisianthus flowers . A cake of understated elegance is Reception Confection . A superbly draped cake-stand gives the illusion of height for a small two-tired wedding cake . Milk-chocolate-colored grosgrain ribbons , roses , primroses , and stylized leaves are artfully placed . The Mosaic Magic cake , reminiscent of ancient mosaic tradition , is updated with magnificently crafted hydrangeas and balloon flowers . The top is a moulded-sugar vase filled with gold ribbon loops and the same sugar flowers . Ms. Vincent suggests sugar-mosaic gift tags to match the wedding cake which may be placed on the brides table.Ms . Vincent 's formal cakes excel . The Marquise de Pompadour cake , reminiscent of the Marquise 's lifestyle , reveals the elegance of jewelry design in sugar . Medallions , suggesting golden topaz surrounded by pearls , superbly ornament the sides of the four-tiered cake . Drapes and ribbons at the side caught by jewels add richness to the bottom tier . A very fashionable cake , Pretty Petals-Precious Pastels , is covered in rolled fondant , which is sponged with salmon-pink and white food coloring , and when dried , is brushed with antique luster dust . Stenciled ribbons and tassels complete the cake and magnificent polka-dotted and stripped camellias add drama . A delightful and sophisticated groom 's cake , Sea Shades Shimmer , has jewel-toned tropical fish artfully arranged on sand-colored fondant-covered white chocolate . Each fish is individually sculptured and painted with pale-green , green-gold , ruby and teal luster dusts.Attesting to true greatness in art , Ms. Vincent promotes decorators with promise . Although each guest cake is extraordinary , two are favorites . A crown of pale peach roses adorns the A Jewel in the Crown guest cake by Scott Ferguson . Splendid in three tiers , pale peach roses are tastefully interspersed among beveled lace leaves that adorn the two top tiers . White mini bells dusted with silk-white luster dust delicately hang over four magnificent Maharaja-type chocolate elephants which stand on the third tier whose side designs are framed filigree panels . They hold garlands of jasmine finger flowers in their trunks , which traditional thinking suggests will bring the wedding couple good luck . The Fantasia Roseta Romantica , a guest cake by Rosa Viacava De Ortega , features ruched dotted-Swiss sugar drapes with crocheted-like sugar trim . Pale pink fantasy flowers are positioned delicately , and patterned bows and ribbon tails sit on top . Each of the four tiers is on a separate acrylic stand creating the effect of cakes floating in air.Because weddings are filled with little memorable extras , Ms. Vincent has added several `` touches of elegance '' which may please the discriminating bride . Three of several catch the eye : The Tussie Mussie , a sugar Victorian posy holder embossed using metal strips , ornamented with sugar lace and filled with sugarpaste flowers of choice . The Romantic Foot First is a collection of dazzling sugar footwear for the bride 's table , each assembled on a Vincent Marquetry Plaque for display . The Petite Guilded Cottage , dedicated to Lord Wedgwood who encouraged Ms. Vincent in her career , is resplendent in gold and white . Tiers in a Teacup , tiny individual stacked cakes sitting atop elegant china cups are a timely design.Extensive instructions are provided for the cake decorations and the memorable extras . Templates also provided for flowers and side designs . Ms. Vincent 's signature recipes are included , as are her notes on decorating . Guest Donna Davis instructs on the decorating the cake table.Kerry Vincent 's Romantic Weddings will set the standard of wedding cakes for years . Every experienced cake decorator who desires to earn serious money for his/her work should have this book . Because knowledge about the basics of cake decorating and sugar work is necessary , dedicated amateurs will find Romantic Wedding Cakes an exciting challenge , beginners may gain inspiration , and the aficionados may experience delight.A most splendid cake in lace is Love is in the Air . It is decorated in pale teal rolled fondant and flounced with sugar eyelet lace ; each eyelet is circled in antique silk luster dust.The All That Glitters cake , dramatic with gold scrolls and pearls , is topped with an ornate crown .	1
I have been searching for this book ( 1st Ed . 1978 ) for some time and finally this new edition came out . If you are interested in German Tanks of WWII , or in military scale modelling , this book can provide you with invaluable information . This book is one of its kind !	1
2001 is one of my favorite films of all time and one of my favorite Kubrick films , and this is a worthy title for the library . Bizony does an excellent job of explaining the making of this epic film , and there many pictures from the fim , sets , and production . I do wish some of the images were larger and in color . There are quite a few color images , but there are quite a few black and white ones also . Highly recommended .	1
I liked this story as the individuals seemed real and there was limited text spent on setting up scenes . Rather the individuals talked and interacted and that allowed you to understand what the scene was and allowed your own imagination to work on the details . And most importantly , the main characters were not perfect individuals , they certainly had their foibles and that set up some of the mis-steps and tension in whether or not they would solve the mystery as they kept just one step ahead of the cops . The main reason that I did n't give this 5 stars was that the reasons for the villian 's actions seemed to be added at the end , with little to no lead up throughout the story although he was introduced relatively early in the action . Still , I would recommend this story to someone who likes to figure out mysteries and enjoys learning about the history of monasteries in England .	1
The adventures of Hugh keep us rooted in England 's past as we romp through a field of unforgetable characters , ancient biases and laws , and the short-comings of medical science in those years . I do n't want the series to stop !	1
In just six little chapters , Catherine Campbell breaks our hearts for all those who are hurting , all those who have been hurt . We 've all been there . We can all connect with one of her stories . We so want acceptance . All of us have at one time felt Nameless , or Hopeless , or Worthless , Helpless , Powerless , or Loveless . And God heals all that and accepts us . He knows our names.Each chapter includes an applicable Bible story about a real Bible character , fictionalized to make that person more real to us , to fill in some possible details . It is beautifully written . I was spellbound and could n't quit reading it ! The second half of each chapter describes the story of someone that has personally affected the author , Catherine Campbell . The stories are heartrending . These tales make us cheer for Christians who have helped others see the reality and majesty of Christ , those who have helped people understand that God knows our names and loves us . It 's about real people shining their lights for Jesus , being His hands and feet and doing something for His glory and kingdom .	1
If your kids are fans of the Miffy books they wo n't be disappointed by this one . It 's a cute story with Bruna 's classic iconic drawings .	1
This book was a quick read , liked the characters and the story line was enjoyable . I would recommend the book .	1
Enjoyed the characters and the storyline . Hope to see more of this author . Maybe we 'll see more of Claudia and Melanie on future books .	1
I enjoyed the story , well written . unfortunately I read about 7 books a week so I can not remember the story line just remember that I liked it	1
Great read which can be done in one sitting . Love the name Fizz , that was something different . Fizz and Luke clash and we continue the ride till the end . I will be reading the other two .	1
Well written and well illustrated , a nice book to have for studying this battle.A good book to have for anyone interested in the Civil war .	1
This outstanding review of the British Army of the mid to late 1700 's was published by Osprey History , the leader of military history . This is a basic review of the soldiers , equipment , life , and history of those in the British Army stationed in Europe and North America from 1740 's to the 1790 's . Brief summary 's are told about the life of a British Soldier , the pay he would receive , morale of units , harsh discipline , family life of the dependents , equipment carried into the field , weaponry , infantry tactics of battle formation and marches and their strengths and weaknesses . Excellent colored illustrations highlight the various headgear worn , different uniforms through the years , battles , marches , and even recruiting civilian men into the army.The author Stuart Reid did an outstanding job of summarizing around 50 years of their important history of the 18th Century when the Army evolved into an international force . This book is highly recommended for those who are into British and American history , American Revolution re-enactors , military history , and those who are interested in 18th Century History . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !	1
I rate this book highly because it does its job , which is an introduction and background to the Battle of Waterloo for people who are new to this part of history and might want a good general background and understanding without going too deeply into the area . Very easy to read with lots of pictures . Do n't expect a big heavy tome though , it really is a beginner 's guide and a good one too . A very good starting point and easily digested . The only criticism I had was that the illustrations do n't include the date , so a picture in the book is often not contemporary at all but painted decades after the Battle . There are many contemporary illustrations but many are n't and it is impossible to tell as dates are n't given . Since often contemporary pictures and illustrations tell us much , I found it bad historical practice that dates were n't given . However , a good starting point for the novice researcher .	1
This book proves a concise summary of the French Indochina war , but its real value is to provide visual context . Typical of all Osprey series books it is well illustrated and well captioned . There are organizational details and equipment explanations . The text is too short to provide more than a brief and cursory explanation of operations , but this is not its purpose . Author Martin Windrow is an expert on Indochina and is the author of a definitive book about the battle Dien Bien Phu . This book is an excellent companion to the works of Bernard Fall ( STREET WITHOUT JOY , HELL IN A VERY SMALL PLACE & # 60 ; etc ) and the recent spate of revisionist looks at the French experience in Indochina . Highly recommended as a supplementary text .	1
Prior to this book I knew next to nothing about this all important battle from Nappy 's early days . This battle illustrates the importance of assigning good men to the command of your Army so that they can arrive in the nick of time to save you from defeat .	1
This book is wonderful ! The authors take stories of influential women fromthe Arthurian legends and frame their tales in the context of the Goddess mythology that lies behind the legends . They explain how each Lady of the Lake is actually a disguised version of a Goddess archetype , thinly veiled by later patriarchal tradition . Wonderful for anyone who loves mythology . Also includes guided visualizations dealing with the women , which explore the reader 's own psyche as well as the archetypes . I devoured it .	1
Dr Miller is an expert in the field of helping people deal with ritual ( extreme/organized ) abuse , she presents at the International Society for the Study of Trauma & Dissociation along with better known professionals such as Ellen Lacter , although the majority of her time is devoted to clinical practice.At the start of the book were a number of different short sections , which , while helpful , meant it took a while to get to the essence of the book . If you pick this book up expecting to read about sensationalist crimes committed by satanists then you have chosen the wrong type of book . She does not write from a Christian point of view , nor does she suggest that religion is necessary for healing . There is no singling out of any particular community , and her suggested approaches depend on the actual abuse and current situation rather than the group 's beliefs ( or lack of them ) .There are warnings in a number of places to say survivors should not read the book - or if they do read sections it should be only will the full awareness of their therapist and some sections are unlikely to benefit survivors at all ( the book is aimed at therapists , not survivors or their partners ) . After flicking past this warning there is another , similar warning addressed to any `` detective parts '' who are still reading - those with DID will be able to relate to this immediately . It also offers a refund for anyone choosing not to read further.Although Dr Miller has included explanations of dissociative identity disorder and dissociative disorder not otherwise specified ( now known as OSDD in the DSM5 ) , I would be very surprised if anyone reading it did not have a grasp of at least some of the information beforehand . DDNOS is largely ignored in many books , but Dr Miller describes it well.I was also warned before reading this book that it was an extremely tough read ( emotionally ) and that it true . The book does give some trauamatizing examples of ritual abuse which are of course horrific , and which you are unlikely to have heard before unless you have worked in clinical practice with a number of survivors of this type of abuse . What I did not expect though was the description of her attempts to help her `` first four '' survivors of such abuse to turn out as it did , but it does the reality of how difficult this area can be to work in . She also talks about how survivors have been harrassed for attending therapy and how to keep yourself safe as a therapist.The chapter called `` The unimaginable '' was about the deep emotional pain in recovering from this type of abuse , and it was reassuring to see in print the importance of allowing someone to fully express their emotions instead of trying to comfort them too soon . Dr Miller talks about the importance of the griefing process in healing , something many other books gloss over or avoid.Much of her advice is incredibly simple and very effective , for example if programming is activated simply asking for the part doing that action to `` turn it off '' , and always seeking to understand the purpose behind the actions rather than being distracted or overwhelmed by the actions themselves . She also includes a section on tricks , lies and indoctrination which addresses the way young children are manipulated for the purposes of an abusive group.Several sections of this book include writing by survivors - which is a great help in understanding what it is like for them , including the tricky topic of integration as explained from several different points of view . One of the survivors was also a `` trainer '' within an abusive group as an adult and she describes the ways in which trauma was caused in that group , with Dr Miller analyzing parts of this . In addition she includes a chapter on `` programmed pedophilia '' and how this case be resolved by finding and resolving the original abuse which was used to create it . This is very much a taboo subject but she tackles it well . She also continually stresses the importance of survivors deciding things for themselves and explains clearly the importance of boundaries in preventing survivors taking on therapist beliefs as their own.Dr Miller 's writing style is clear and engaging throughout , she describes some complex topics well but only when absolutely necessary . Her use of anonymized case studies is a real strength within the book and makes it much easier to relate to and apply . This is an excellent book , and it will be interesting to see which minor changes she makes after receiving feedback on it ( she asks for feedback within the book ) . If you find reading the book too traumatizing it would be better to consider referring the client on.At the end of the book is a list of other books which may be useful , in particular she suggests Safe Passage to healing for survivors .	1
You can always count on Rudolf Steiner to take any of your preconceived notions and set them on their ear , and Secret Brotherhoods might be the most amazing of all his books . Steiner is no easy read , and even harder to explain , so I 'll do my best with lots of quotes from the great man himself.Secret Brotherhoods is a set of lectures given by Steiner in November of 1917 , and that 's what 's truly amazing . I ca n't think of anyone today , who 's even come close to the logical intelligence of Rudolf Steiner , and in so many important areas of life , actually , the most important areas of our collective lives.To sum up how Steiner is important today , is that explains the 2 thoughts that compete for our attention , or soul if you will . One is the Ahrimanic side of our being , and one is the Luciferian side of our being . Now this might seem antiquated to our modern minds , but wait , on the Arhimanic side , you have a pure materialistic view , while the Luciferian side , you have an idealistic view of life . The Ahrimanic side wants you to only see the material things in life , and to strive to towards them is the ideal , with money being the main issue.The Luciferian side wants you to live in the mind , ignoring the material and striving only towards an unattainable utopia . So how is the relevant today ? Republicans ( Ahrimanic , material side ) Democrats ( Luciferian , communist ideals ) , and wait , there 's a balance of both sides , a middle way , and that 's the Christ consciousness . We are here not to fight about which way is right , we 're here to learn to balance these two sides as Jesus showed us , and that 's through love . This is a fight for the very soul of man , not just the vote for a certain party.Hard to believe that Steiner gave these lectures nearly a hundred years ago , yet still they hold true and except that now , we 're so polarized that to even mention that you 're a moderate gets you labeled as 'wishy-washy ' or too stupid to make up your mind . Well , the joke 's on the name-callers , because being in balance is what our task is as a human being.Here 's Steiner 's explanation of the Arimanic ( could this be where the word manic originate from ? ) being ( which is what is talked about in Faust ) : `` When a human being enters earthly existence through birth he gains on the one hand the possibility of giving means of existence to his soul through his physical body . . . but on the other hand a person does not know his physical body at all well . What an extraordinary number of things go on in our body of which we know nothing . . . we arrive in this world with the garment of our organism without being able to to reach down into it with our soul to any great extent . Instead shortly before we are born , not very long before we are born , there is also an opportunity for another spiritual being , apart from our soul , to take possession of our body , namely , of the subconscious part of our body . This is a fact . Shortly before we are born another being indwells us ; in the terminology we use today , we call this an ahrimanic being . It is just as much in us is our own soul . `` So we proceed through our life while having our soul and also a double who is far cleverer than we are , very intelligent , but with a mephistophelian intelligence ( see politicians , bankers and lawyers for an example of this ) . and in addition also an ahrimanic will , a very strong will , a will that this more akin to the forces of nature than it is to our human will which is ruled by our heart and mind . . . Those electric currents are the forces that are introduced into our being by the being I have just been describing . . .They want to conquer the earth , so they need bodies . Having no bodies of their own they use much of human bodies as they can since the human soul can not quite fill the human bodies . `` pages 56-57And here 's the catch , these beings ca n't stand death , so they depart when the body is about to expire . They control our automatic bodily systems , which can explain why we lose those controls when we die , or are even threatened with death ( think of how ones loses control when they 're severely frightened and you get the idea ) .Anyway , that was just one page of a lecture , so if you want to jump into the very deep end of the metaphysical pool , Rudolf Steiner is your man.As an aside , Stephanie Meyers , the author of the Twilight series , wrote a book called Host , that touches on this subject . It 's worth reading .	1
This is a nice book with lots of interesting stitches , and illustrations . I can hardly wait to try them out	1
I looked at a lot of Aran sweater patterns , but I just could n't find the perfect one . I bought this book after I checked it out from my local libary , because it 's an essential for any knitting bookshelf . It has every stitch you could want , plus many combinations of stitches . It helps you put together your own unique combinations by organizing the stitch pattterns by the number of rows for each repeat . For each stitch you get a clear color photo , row-by-row directions , and chart directions . It also has comparison photos of common cables and bobbles by size , and how to read the charts and abbreviations .	1
I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers . This is a gorgeous book , the photos are beautiful , the yarns used are high quality and yet affordable , and the directions are simple.I have knit eight of the patterns . I have yet to have a mistake that was not of my own making . Even though I am more of an intermediate knitter , this book is just the thing for a quick project for a gift , or even for your own baby ! Debbie Bliss 's Cashmerino Dk weight is a perfect substitute for the Jaeger cashmere , if you ca n't find it at your local yarn store . Plymouth 's baby alpaca does nicely for the teddy bear . I used La Luz spun silk for the garter stitch slippers , and they turned out beautifully . The booties are soft and gorgeous when done in Lorna 's Laces Angel ( an angora/lambswool blend ) . I also used Lorna 's Laces Shepherd Socks yarn for the Mabel dress . I found the hand dyed yarn to give a gorgeous colorway , and the superwash wool to be extra handy for those times when baby spits all over her dress ! My reccommendations for this book are as follows : Make a gauge swatch . Read the pattern BEFORE you start to knit . Make sure you have checked the sizing charts at the end of the book , and remember that what would have fit my sister # 4 at birth ( all nine pounds of her ) , would n't have fit sister # 3 ( barely six pounds ) . Make two sizes if you 're unsure , you 'll find SOME baby to wear them ! Also , remember , it 's just knitting , so do n't be fearful to branch out ! If you have to pull your stitches out , no one has to know !	1
The book is a classic and hefty compendium of pipeline issues . It is certainly true that much remains unchanged from earlier editions . In part this is simply because many problems that are mechanical in nature , and involve design , usage and repair remain prevalent . The surfeit of diagrams is welcome and indispensible in helping the reader quickly grasp problems and their solutions.You can also appreciate from the book the variety of industries that use pipes . Most critically , we see issues in oil refineries and chemical plants . Intricate problems that have very expensive consequences if not quickly and correctly treated.The readership can vary , from the professional mechanical and civil engineer to a technician . Indeed perhaps even a layperson , who might be pondering tackling a piping problem herself . Though be warned that many methods involve specialised tools and machinery unlikely to be commonly available.Another reviewer remarked that the book describes using an HP C41 calculator , while claiming that the world has been using `` Excel for over a decade '' . This does depend on context of usage . The C41 is still widely used . Plus a calculator might be handier and more likely to be used than a PC or laptop by an engineer in the field , who needs to run some quick calculations . Note this - the book itself may probably be used in an office , due to its size . But the calculator functions well as a field instrument.Perhaps this book should have come out in hardcover ? The large number of pages and their size makes the paperback somewhat unwieldy , even in an office .	1
Materials and the Environment is a comprehensive , well-researched book on the subject . If you ever wanted to know about the life-cycle of materials , this book is for you .	1
First of all many of you have heard the term `` Gaussian '' , which is often used to describe something so unbelievably complicated , that we use the term referring to the mathematics of Carl Gauss , a mid-19th century mathematician . His understanding of statistics , waveforms and complex mathematics , probably rivaled Nicola Tesla , and maybe even exceeded him . I bring that up here because despite the 150 year span of their development , many of his mathematical treatment of waveforms , is actually used in Digital Signal Processing . Difficult to understand integrations , linear algebra with complex matrices , and calculations for various filtering , are true `` Gaussian '' concepts put in this book . If you do n't like math to some degree , stay clear of this book , it 's for tech savvy people only , to implement the content.Based on the title , I was expecting a lot more C language examples , of how to implement signal processing . In the beginning sections , data security , then data error correction , and finally lossless data compression , there was a lot of C code examples , to help you implement your own application . Once we get into signals , transforms , filters , digital communications , speech , then audio , and digital processing , most of the code disappears . In it 's place , some very complex math , topical layouts , schematics , and waveform diagrams . I think the book lets us down here , at the very least . they should have included a companion CD containing more sample code . It 's difficult to implement complex mathematics in any programming language , except perhaps MatLab or some other math-specific modeling product . I was looking to see some of these complex matrices , integral expressions , statistical formula 's , broken down , and implemented in C. I was disappointed to say the least.If you have a career with the phone company as an engineer , a CATV engineer , a sound or video engineer , or even a programmer of cell phones , and other infotainment devices , this book will at least give you a start . It will cover the topics you need to chew on , if you need to implement some complex form of digital communication . You are still going to need to get , the correct , specific treatments in your field , so this is not the best self-contained book . It is great to have on the reference shelf if you work in one of those fields , otherwise it 's just taking up valuable reference space . If you are a math student or engineering major , cross reference this with your physics , differential equations , advanced calculus , or linear algebra classes . If you understand it all , and even crave more , it may be time to apply to Cal Tech or MIT !	1
The pros and the cons are that this is like an older textbook . It is long , spends a lot of time on things that are n't really practical , it 's dry , but it does have a lot to say . It 's not something to avoid , but there are more useful choices for most people .	1
This is a pretty fascinating handbook to look through even if you 're not a professional . It 's chock full of complicated mathematical formulas which are way over the levels I reached . But it gives you an idea of the amazing technical complexity of the drilling industry . It sounds fun to head off to Texas or Okhlahoma and prospect for an oil or gas field . But it would probably be an extremely complex task to build a major company . Under Drilling Fluids formulas/categories , my gaze fell upon : Cua = Mud additives in the underflow going into the mixing pit ; and Cu = Centrifuge underflow volume . Even in the Basic Calculations , you find : BF = Buoyancy factor ; and Cca = Cycles or strokes for casing/drill pipe anulus . Ok , so I got my taste of wildcatting and oil rigging ! I think I better stick to movies . : P	1
Review of : `` Metrics and Methods for Security Risk Management , '' by Carl S. Young.As a Chemical Branch Officer in the U.S. Army and subject matter expert in the realm of CBRNE ( Chemical , Biological , Radiological , Nuclear , High Yield Explosives ) operations I am always looking to broaden my chosen field of learning and expertise . I obtained this text in order to review in particular Author Young 's thoughts , insight , and recommendations on reducing vulnerability with regard to vehicle borne explosive threats , explosive threats , radiological threats , biological threats , and chemical threats located within the last chapter ( Chapter 6 ) of his text . What I found was insightful and of value especially with regard to Anti-terrorism Level Two planning . I was pleased with the content of the rest of the book as well and learned much about `` The Structure of Security Risk , '' and the `` Measuring and Mitigating ( of ) Security Risk . '' I will definitely be referring to this text during my next round of physical security planning . Well done . Five stars without hesitation .	1
As a first introduction to manga as art and product , this book is fantastic . I started reading having only been exposed to a few manga titles and knowing almost nothing about manga in general , besides the stereotypes that exist in the American imagination . The author , Paul Gravett , dispels all of the popular misconceptions about manga and the Japanese people 's relationship with it and provides a concise history of the medium , from its roots in Tokugawa-era prints to the revolution of artists like Osamu Tezuka , and finally to the modern adaptations of many manga into films and television series.Gravett 's writing is easy to follow , and he seems to be extremely thorough in his research . He includes chapters on underground manga , erotic and pornographic manga , as well as the more well-known boys ' ( shonen ) and girls ' ( shojo ) manga that Americans are so familiar with . Since the book is large in size , the pages and pages of manga excerpts are easy to read and provide excellent examples of pretty much every genre of manga that exist.I recommend this book to anyone who is just beginning to venture into manga , or anyone interested in the modern Japanese psyche . Gravett 's history of manga is also a study of modern Japanese people and the way they look at the world around them .	1
Fantastic book , smart read and wonderful images ! A must for any art library . Viva fashion illustration ! Thanks , Cally Blackman . Brava !	1
Art by Tattooists : Beyond Flash could have been called `` Beyond Flesh '' instead , because it features works by tattoo artists that do not use skin as the canvas . 26 artists are featured , and Jo Waterhouse presents 4 to 6 pages of their art . She also gives very brief bios , and snippets of interviews . Typically the written portions discuss what media ( besides tattooing ) the artists work in , and how their tattoo art influences or differs from their work in other media . Websites are listed for the artists and/or their studios , though why all the myspace links but none to Facebook or Twitter ? As a person who knows little about art and tattooing this was a very satisfying introduction to these artists . It is particularly interesting to see how some of the artists such as Clifton Carter and Regino Gonzales produce works that one would not guess to be by a tattoo artist if not previously familiar with them . One of Waterhouse 's goals in producing this work is to show how tattoo artists are finally coming to be accepted as artists , and to this end she is successful .	1
Sometimes we are so opinionated and focused on the forest that we ca n't see the trees . It seems a human trait to want to decorate our bodies with art . Maybe that art is designed to ward off evil or show the wearer 's rank , but most primitive societies have been tattooing bodies for longer than recorded history . The prehistoric Ice Man discovered a few years ago in the Alps had tattoos . Peruvian mummies found high in Andes Mountains had tattoos . `` There are no records and no one can be entirely sure , the history of tattooing seems to show that the art of decorating the body with tattoos probably first made an appearance almost 40,000 years ago in the Upper Paleolithic era known as the Stone Age . Evidence of tattooing -- bone tattoo tools and pigments occurring this early have recently been found in a cave in France . '' It is n't a stretch of logic to deduce that Stone Age cave dwellers who could produce the lasting high quality paintings found in French Caverns would have first developed the ability to decorate their own bodies for whatever reason . Tattoos had the advantage of being mobile and traveling wherever the tattoo 's proud owner wandered . It is likely that the cave dwellers were or had been nomads for millennia before they started painting masterpieces deep inside caves.Today , people like myself , have neglected to think of tattoos as real art . We have considered them an interesting form of fashion fad with most examples rather primitive not-that-great line drawings produced to please lonely , lovesick drunken sailors or soldiers . The tattoo artist has been stereotyped as a skinny druggie or muscle bound ex-biker who scratches out a living providing poorly conceived and executed designs on the human body canvas.The classic tattoo designs of the past are referred to as `` Flash . '' As the title of this art collection says , this art by tattooists is definitely `` beyond Flash . `` Once a person thinks about it , they have probably seen some excellent examples of tattoos . The Japanese Mobsters the Yakuza have brought full-body tattoo wearing to a new high . This reviewer has often heard his sons mention the fact that some of their RISD and Mass College of Art classmates earn their living working in tattoo parlors.This 128-page art book , perhaps the first such book , includes the work of `` twenty-six international artists who use a variety of mediums , from ink , watercolor , acrylic paint , and oil to lino printing , painting on wood and board , and even examples of tattoo-style skateboard graphics . '' This reviewer would add the tattoo-like work often added to fancy vans and motorcycles to that list , but those artists are n't included in this book.The illustrations in this book are laid out in an exhibition catalogue style with a brief biographies and comments from the twenty-six artists whose work is included . The work is beautifully reproduced . This reader liked some work better than others , but was impressed by the sheer variety of styles represented . Carnie Marnie had a couple of works I found very skillful as well as very amusing . One acrylic and watercolor on paper life-like portrait of a frightened woman who appears about to scream out in terror at what she is observing is entitled `` There 's No Place Like Home . '' Across the double-page spread are two shocking pink toilet seats decorated with sexy little devils by the same artist . The titles included in big letters on the seats are `` Red Hot '' for one and `` Hot S -- t '' for the other.This reviewer loved the head portrait entitled `` Veil of Death '' by an artist who paints under the name of `` Sumo . '' Likewise for several of the works by Gillian Goldstein my favorite being a mixed media on paper called `` Ganesh . '' Another humorous mixed media on paper work by the same artist is titled Trophy Wife . `` Matt Hunt 's oil on canvas `` Love and Fear '' is a totally different style than the rest of the book , but it is beautifully done . The book includes a short foreword by Jesse Lee Denning , which is very helpful for the reader unfamiliar with tattoo art . This is a nicely done pop art book . No matter what the reader may think about tattoos hundreds of thousands of people have liked the art well enough to display it permanently on their body for the rest of their lives . Not that such a morbid fact is included in this tome , but the Nazi concentration camps often kept a rogues gallery of unusual tattoos from some of their dead victims . Sorry about adding that icky fact about the Nazi 's , but it does make a point . Some tattoos survived beyond the life of the human canvas.Much of the art included in this book would not make good tattoos on the human canvas . Much of it would look just fine decorating the human body , but then human canvas would have to put up with people constantly wanting to examine it more closely . That would probably be fine if the wearer is a real exhibitionist , but for most people that kind of attention would probably get old in a hurry ? For women canvases it could definitely become a really scary problem .	1
I have no relationship to the culture of fixed gear , ( outside of just liking the bikes ) , and expected more 'nuts and bolts ' , less style . Nonetheless , it 's an attractive book .	1
Divine is not a word I normally would use in describing anything bike related , but I think this little coffee table volume is perfectly described as just that - divine . I am not a fixed bike person - I adore my geared Raleigh , and have n't been as happy with a bike since - well - my first Raleigh ... but everything about Fixed is appealing , from the fantastic selection of photos and diagrams that pack a visual punch , to the well-written descriptions , explanations , theories , and observations that fill its pages . This is a book to savor and share , to give to all your friends who ride any bike at all . A note -- - I had no difficulty with the size or darkness of the type and I 'm in my 50 's .	1
I actually bought this twice , because I forgot I had purchased it the first time ... Really good though , must be to buy it twice .	1
this is the funniest set of postcards i 've ever seen ! the postcards have the tiny little figurines doing the most surprisingly offensive things ! there 's sex , nudity , and violence . when i 'm sending these , i put sticky notes over the really naughty pictures because i am a little worried about the postcards being censored by the post office .	1
I got one of these for each of my grandchildren 's families for Christmas . They love the game and ask me to play whenever I come over . Lots of fun for age 6-9 .	1
I bought this as a gift for my friend 's son to go along with a model building kit . I liked it I hope he does too .	1
I like this story the most of Hardy 's works . An interesting tale with some good , realistic characters . I think I 'll read it again .	1
For some reason Tom Holt has never gotten the attention that Terry Pratchett does . They are both comic geniuses , both very solid , imaginative writers , and both manage to be incredibly prolific . Possibly , it is because Pratchett has chosen to set his stories in Discworld , with a regular cast of characters , and Holt starts from scratch each time . But , without question , you ca n't go wrong with either one . Providing you like to laugh , that is.Somehow three little hackers ( disguised as three colorblind mice ) slip into the castle of the Wicked Queen and come upon her just as she is running Mirrors 3.1 on her magic mirror . They watch as she runs 'Who_is_fairest.exe and sets an appointment in her calendar for doing away with Snow White . As the queen slips off the hackers attempt to take control of the operating system . No surprise , the pest control software works and the Queen returns in what is almost the nick of time . Unfortunately , the female of the three mice turns the mirror off rather than shutting it down . In this world , Mirrors 3.1 is the real operating system , and it does n't take well to sudden power losses.In fact , it scrambles everything in memory - which is everything . The Wicked Queen quickly grabs her backup memory bucket ( think of it as a 'wet ' drive ) , and heads off into the magic forest to find someone who knows how to pour a full system reload . And so begins the ultimate fractured fairy tale . In it , you will discover that the Three Pigs have resorted to building with concrete and anti-tank weapons . You will meet the wolf that huffs , puffs and says 'rivet . ' And find out that Snow White is fond of bondage . You will even get to wonder 'What are these seven samurai doing in a dwarf tale . 'What you wo n't get to do is sit there , read with a grim expression , and not even utter a snicker . Tom Holt is a wizard at the quickly set up , awful pun ( & quot ; two wrongs do n't make us Wrights & quot ; and & quot ; good fencers make bad neighbors. & quot ; He has a knack for literary sight gags and the sublimely ridiculous . His books are meant for those times when all the bits refuse to fit together and you just need to think about something else . Or when you want to get somewhat hysterical for a few hours . While this is n't Holt 's very best effort ( try 'Expecting Someone Taller ' or 'Flying Dutch ' ) it is , like all of his work , way better than any of the competition except Pratchett .	1
This book renders essential insight into Korean culture , which is complimentary to the undertaking of studying Korean language . While one may learn to speak Korean , it is also very vital to know more about , appreciate , and understand the culture . This helps better direct language and treat cooloquialisms with awareness , as well as spoken figures of speech . As one may already know , in dealing with language , prosody and the way things are said or understood , are equally important in the dynamics of communication skills .	1
This book does exactly what it states . It gives you the bear heart of what Theravada Buddhism is , what those who practice it generally think as well as the layman views on it from east and western points . It does it in a way which is long and deep enough to give you what you want to know and a little more . Without over complicating it with alot of opinions , and degressions ! Absolutely worth buying .	1
I picked this handy little book up more as a writing reference than anything to use in day-to-day life , and in that it 's functioned just fine.The organization is simple and consistent . Each section starts with `` What [ Practitioners ] Believe '' , then moves into an overview of places of worship , which segues into services . From there , it continues into festivals and holy days , then rituals and ceremonies , starting with birth and moving through death . Each section then closes with helpful words and phrases.The information itself is sufficient , if not completely in depth ; it 's limited a bit by the format . Still , it 's a great launching point , giving one a good basis from which to research further . The `` What Do I Do ? '' boxes are unique and particularly helpful , too , in clarifying the expectations for the behavior of a non-practicing guest .	1
This is a concise survey of the beliefs and practices of about half a dozen of the world 's religions . It is useful for people who are invited to a religious event of a friend or family member of a different faith . Or for those simply curious , of course . If only people could come together as peacefully as the descriptions in Lonsdale 's little book.Basic tenets , places of worship , holidays , and ceremonies are described in overview fashion . Of valuable interest are the offset boxes on `` what happens , '' and `` what do I do . '' There are a lot of world religion survey books to choose from but few of them offer as much practicality in as little space . Highly recommended .	1
I was looking for a book like this . I highlighted the parts I feel I will need to work on . Easy to read . Good examples and guidance about how to communicate . I 'll hold on to this one .	1
This is a good book . There is an overemphasis on the endgame . One can not reach the endgame with the type of positions that this book would expect you to know if you can not survive the opening . My two favorits still are highly recommended over this one , CHESS FOR JUNIORS & WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS .	1
This is a great book and a must have for any chess enthusiast . I admire Tal for his humble approach to analyzing his own games and discussing his extrodinary accomplishments . Through this book I have learned an artistry and attention to detail , and possibly enhancement in my own games . The autobiographical accounts discussed by Tal give you a good perspective of the competitions he takes part in . There is also accounts of when and how he became a smoker , details into his medical procedures and how it affected him in his play and mood . I feel very thankful to have this unique account of Tal through his own words and through his own assessment of his games . Be prepared to be inspired by his colorful calculations that seem to come alive at the board the creativeness and amazing use of the pieces . I believe chess players that try to aspire to one brilliancy in all of Tal 's games will benifit by the creative approaches and look beyond the simplification towards more complexity , and to not be afraid to sacrifice a piece for activity , initiative , or tactical devilry . A very distinguished and talented player .	1
Joe Gallagher 's book Starting Out : The Kings Indian Defense , is a marvelous openings book for beginners and intermediate players alike . Gallagher focuses on the important things like the ideas behind the moves , the strategies , the tactical ideas that develop in the various structures and variations of the KID.The KID is one of the most important defenses in chess , and has been played by many great champions including Kasparov and Fischer . Fischer in fact used it exclusively throughout his chess career . The KID offers black a fighting chance for more than a draw against d4 , and is flexible enough to be used against many other non e4 openings.GM Gallagher presents the newest lines in a clear manner , He offers suggestions as to what variation might be best for you the reader . He provides invaluable tips and warnings throughout the book . The first 4 chapters are on the Classical Variation . He follows that with a chapter each on the Samisch , Fianchetto , Four Pawns , and Averbakh variations . The last two chapters are devoted to white 's early h2-3 , and `` other '' systems.While this book is not meant to be a thorough treatist on the KID , it is an excellent starting place , and allows the reader to begin playing the KID well , quickly . This book is supposed to be a beginners guide to the KID , not a beginners guide to opening a chess game . However , a beginner would do well to jump into this book and this defense quickly after blitzing through a good beginners book like Capablanca 's Chess Fundamentals.Everyman 's Starting Out series looks like a good one . I love this book and have since ordered Starting Out : The Caro Kann also by Joe Gallagher ( Since I also play the Caro , and have for years ) , and have recently ordered Starting Out : The Sicilian by John Emms since I am searching for a more aggresive defense to e4 to complement my d4 KID repertiore.In closing , I highly recommend this book , and suggest following it up with Mastering the Kings Indian Defense By Robert Bellin and Pietro Ponzetto . After that plnge into more complicated theory based works if you desire more , but thoses two volumes alone should serve you well for a long time , and help make you a dangerous player verses d4 .	1
The target audience of this book is players that really have no idea what they 're doing in a sicilian . It really is a fine introduction for such players . It will help you begin to form a repertoire as white or black.If you 've already decided to play 6 . Bg5 against the Najdorf , the Yugoslav attack against the Dragon , the Maroczy Bind against the Accelerated Dragon , and so on , this book is not at all for you.For a player who plays the Sicilian as black - pick your variation and jump right to the book on that .	1
In my first week of the fourth grade , the teacher announced that everyone in the class was going to learn how to play chess . She believed that it was the best game to be incorporated into an educational scheme and she was right . We all learned and certain times each week were set aside for games of chess . It was a very popular time , as playing any game was preferable to doing other things like spelling and writing practice.I am in complete agreement with this philosophy , firmly believing that everyone should learn to play chess . This book is an excellent way to start , which is what you would expect , given that Kasparov is considered the best chess player ever . He starts with a description of the pieces , how they can move and their power rankings . From this , he sets up the game and explains the basic goal of the game as well as the algebraic notation used to represent the movement of the pieces . Kasparov uses a series of situations to illustrate problems , such as how to force a ( stale ) mate from a specific orientation . Solutions to these problems are given at the end and many of them are nontrivial . You are really required to think hard before finding the answer to some of them.Basic strategies such as classical openings , defenses , the pin , a skewer and back rank mating options are covered . The illustrations are very high quality and it could have been used as the textbook for my fourth grade class , where I first learned how to play . Adult beginners will also find it an excellent way to learn.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics , reprinted with permission .	1
This is the best `` English '' book on the Scandinavian . Emms gives a good overview over the most important part of this opening . Studying opening theory in Scandinavian deeply may be neglected , because many believe that this opening is easier to understand than other openings . That 's wrong , Scandinavian is full of tactical possibilities and especially for white ( discovered attack on the queen , d5 breakthrough , attack the Scandinavian bishop with g4 , strong knight on e5 , pawn storm on both kingside and queenside etc ) . Black has to deal with all this threats and more . Emms manage to explain all this quite well ( 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 ) , though I miss more positional evaluation for Black from Emms in several variants . And when I read this book I get the impression that several variants actually are very dangerous for black ( for instance a white setup in the `` 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 '' variant , with Bc4 , d3 , etc ) when Black has to play very carefully . Emms has trouble managing to comfort the black player with clear advice how to meet all the treats from white . So this book is more an opening book on the Scandinavian , than a repertoire book for black.There are written few books about Scandinavian . Andrew Martin has written `` The Essential Center Counter : A Practical Guide for Black '' , which indeed have some value for Scandinavian players , but has a rather chaotic layout with some errors in text and diagrams , it is also rather thin book with large font . You should stay away from Plaskett 's `` The Scandinavian Defence '' , which is just a book with a lot of Scandinavian Games , with very poor instructive comments . Plaskett never manage to layout neither the tactical ideas nor the positional ideas in Scandinavian with this book ( 1 star ) .Scandinavian is a fun opening , and I hope one day there will be an English translation of Wahls `` Modernes Skandinavisch Band 2 '' , which is the Scandinavian bible , very instructive , an unusal opening book .	1
This book on The Complete Chess Workout : Train your brain with 1200 puzzles , was given as a gift and was received with smiles.+++++	1
In the past I 've had some issues with Neil McDonald 's writing , but he is certainly able to produce great books from time to time ; this book is proof.It is extraordinarily clear in its explanations of the themes in question , and is also exceptionally readable thanks to McDonald 's comfortable , avuncular style of annotation . The games flow together to nicely illustrate the author 's point.If nothing else , this book is a fabulous collection of well-annotated games from some of the best players of all-time . I am impressed and very surprised at the quality of this book ( since McDonald 's recent `` Starting Out : 1 e4 ! '' was rather bland . ) But this one is a keeper since it is probably the best book on basic ( to intermediate ) chess strategy in years	1
This is a truly exceptional book . Yasser Seirawan has been a top GM for many years , and for a time was a legitimate candidate for the World Championship . He is one of a rather small club of players who beat both Karpov and Kasparov in individual games when they were in their primes . What makes this book so exceptional , though , is that 1 ) Seirawan is an extraordinary analyst of chess games . He is a genius at positional chess , and has the ability to explain complicated chess concepts in a clear , logical manner that developing players can understand . He is considered one of the best commentators on chess games in the world , and he applies that great skill in explaining his battles with world champions throughout his storied career . 2 ) Seirawan is also a great story teller . In a field where some chess players ' idea of a great 'story ' is to complain about playing conditions , Seirawan is a brilliant and fascinating writer who is as good at human interest stories as he is about explaining a complicated strategic win . There are VERY few chess books that combine brilliant , clear chess analysis of very high level chess with great prose . This is a truly rare book , one that every chess lover should buy and absorb .	1
A brilliant yet down-to-earth touching account of Grandmaster meets the amateur 's mind , colored with masterful strokes from talented writing . The interaction between the two men is , at times , disparate , and other times the connection is powerful . The Grandmaster 's life experience with the doctor 's clinical understanding come together , with shear delight , in the love the battle.As an amateur chess player eager to learn not only how to think regarding the game , I am just as interested in they 'whys ' of amateurish thinking . The book , even without chess , is a fascinating study of how humans think , but it is invaluable to the chess student seeking to grow in his play.Well written , clear , logical , but always fascinating , it is a great tool to advance a player 's understanding of the game .	1
This is one of the best game collections ever written by one of the greatest chess player ever ! It does n't get better than this , Kasparov deeply analyzed his games from promising young player to World Champion ! There is an immense chess knowledge in these pages and a lot to be learned by playing over these games with Kasparov explaining his moves and thoughts during game . Of course he utilized computers to double check and shed new light on these games . This should be in every serious chess players library .	1
If you enjoy chess and Gary you will like this book . Great for anyone who is seriously interested in chess .	1
Interesting , well thought out . Did not know until the end if the two women would turn out to be sisters that were adopted by different families .	1
having purchased several of the other royal wedding publications available , i admit that i had no real expectation for this souvenir booklet . that being said , it turned out to be quite lovely ! be forewarned , this booklet is exactly that : a booklet . in total it is 40 pages ; most of those pages are devoted to the wedding itself , with a few here and there on royal wedding history , as well as william and catherine 's courtship . there are some lovely wide shots of the ceremony , as well as a large image of the balcony kiss . the booklet is concluded with a 5x7ish image of the two of them in the aston martin driving away.i 'm not sure how highly i would recommend this to potential purchasers , even though i am pleased to add it to my collection.the publication i would most recommend is david elliot cohen 's book `` william & catherine : their romance and royal wedding in photographs . '' i have found it to be the most comprehensive and quality publication available.again , i am pleased this is part of my collection , however short it may be .	1
Coincidences is the second novel I read from Maria Savva and it wo n't be the last . Her stories dig deep into people 's mental tug of wars.This story has to do with Alicia and her quest to find her long estranged father and Stephanie , her mother , who tries to shield Alicia from the truth ... ..as far as she knows it.Coincidences is full of layers , we have the events themselves - Alicia was born thanks to a surrogacy agreement , her Dad left them when she was a baby - but more importantly are the motives behind each decision made . Was Stephanie right to let Alicia believe she was her birth mother ? Should Stephanie pursue a relationship with a Father that did n't want her ? Every time a new layer is revealed you get the feeling there must be something more and there is . While the story happens in England , the emotions and situations are universal . Very well written story , I enjoyed it a lot !	1
A superb monograph of a superb aircraft which may be the last MiG fighter to see service . Sadly , this book is becoming hard to find at a reasonable price.This book is 500 pages of almost everything that is publicly available about the MiG-29 as of the publication date . In addition to the usual highly readable text there are plenty of photographs ( almost all in color ) , line drawings , graphs , and tables.In short this is a fantastic book with equally fantastic production values . Things that the Famous Russian Aircraft series does not provide but would add much to the package:1 . ) An index . A necessity for a volume this size . If it was too much to place in the book itself an online index would have been nice.2 . ) A glossary and list of acronyms.3 . ) Maps , maps , maps . For a book aimed primarily at a non Russian audience this is really a serious shortcoming.Another wish would be a greater number of specially commissioned drawings . The 6 view line drawings both of the MiG-29 proper and the various missiles are superb . What would be nicer would be some detailed cutaway and perspective drawings showing the internal details and arrangements of the various MiG-29 models . There are some provided and they are better than nothing but they look to be from technical manuals . Something more on the scale of what is seen in Air International would be more in keeping with the high production values of a book like this.But do n't misunderstand the nits I picked above . This is a five star book . If you have any interest in Soviet/Russian aircraft , pick it up if you can find it for a sane price or hope a 2nd edition is in the works . Much the same can be said for the other `` Famous Russian Aircraft '' titles . There is an Ilyushin Il-2/Il-10 volume on the way . I am looking forward to seeing how a WWII era aircraft is handled in this deluxe format .	1
Amidst the plethora of business books out there , here 's one that is likely to remain in print for many years without ending up in the $ 1.98 bargain table at your local Borders Books . Lewis 's tract covers over 60 different countries and virtually every major region in the world . New chapters in this Third Edition include information on doing business in Iraq , Pakistan , Serbia , Columbia and Venezuela . `` When Cultures Collide '' is more than just a book on doing business internationally ; it is guide to communicating effectively with the individuals of these diverse and emerging markets across the global marketplace.Divided among the `` Lewis Model , '' the author examines and divides cultural types through what he calls `` linear-active , multi-active , and reactive variations . '' For example , the Germans and the Swiss are considered `` linear-actives '' as they thoughtfully plan , schedule , organize , doing one thing at a time ; in contrast , the Chinese , Japanese , and Finns tend to be `` reactives '' since they value and priortize courtesy and respect , as they listen quietly and react carefully to another 's proposal.The book has been tremendeously helpful to me in negotiating deals foreign clients allowing me to avoid the faux pas we Americans erroneously commit while doing business with our international customers.In a nutshell , the author examines how the mind -- any mind is conditioned even at an early age . As a result , the irreversible nature of this childhood training establishes a relationship between langauge , action and thought.For anyone who does business internationally , or simply wishes to find out more about the other cultures on this ever-shrinking planet we share and inhabit , Lewis 's book is a must read .	1
I was a Third Culture Kid and I found this book helpfull in understanding who I am 40 years later . ( I found the TCK phrase awkward but could think of none better . ) I also think this would be of use to people whose childhood was similar to the TCK 's . Especially children who had little stability while growing up . Divorce , parential deaths , and especially children shunted off to boarding schools.Many boarding schools provide a fairly good life and a substitute family , but when it 's over , it 's over . and then who am I ?	1
I tend to be suspicious about most books that attempt to teach us anything from the success of others because I invariably find that they contain the same set of cliches and anecdotes that rarely have much to do with their success . Moreover , these books make one feel like a moron , because they play up all the traits that you probably do n't have . This book was a refreshing change . Written in a matter-of-fact style , it talks about some of the basic rules used by Buffet over many years . Making managers think like owners . Focusing on long-term wealth creation rather than short-term fads . Not investing in anything that he can not understand . This book is a great way to pick up a few broad brush strokes of the Warren Buffet philosophy and then jot down a few pointers that may work for you .	1
This book was very interesting and I enjoyed it very much . I was in Italy for 21 days , and I 'm ready to return after readingChirs Harrison 's excellent book !	1
Essential reading for all expat parents and their children . This book resonated so profoundly for me that I bought a copy for everyone in my birth family : children of expats who were themselves children of expats.It examines and explains the common experiences of those who spend a significant part of their development years outside their parents ' home culture . Pros and cons are addressed , together with practical advice on how to deal with problems . The authors ' understanding of the unique interpersonal and intrapersonal needs of children coming and going from culture to culture is both first-hand and well researched.As a result of this book , I also suddenly realised that all my friends are TCKs and why so many of us are global nomads ; some of us physically , all of us mentally so . There is so much clarification about our shared attitudes and beliefs.I have since recommended this book to a number of TCKs and parents with TCKs - also when the parents are of different nationalities even if the children live in one parent 's birth country .	1
Third Culture Kids are children reared in a country other than their passport - they develop a cultural identity that is neither multi-cultural nor bi-cultural but is rather a third culture . Parts of their parents ' culture , which they pick up from home and/or an international school situation and parts of the culture in which they are living are co-mingled in such a way as to form a third culture in which they live and that is unique to each person ; yet when a third culture kid meets another third culture kid , regardless of background , there is an immediate recognition and immediate kinship . There are some fundamentals , however , that are characteristic of all third culture kids . Common characteristics are a 1 ) cross cultural lifestyle , 2 ) high mobility , 3 ) expected repatriation somewhere , and 4 ) often a system identity with the sponsoring organization/business/ministry . A TCK can be a military brat , a missionary kid , a business brat , a government brat , a global nomad . All third culture kids have a broadened world view , often speak two or more languages , are often cultural bridges for others , have a feeling of rootlessness - home is everywhere and nowhere - and a sense of belonging with others of similar background . Third culture kids struggle with identity and experience grief - often unresolved . They are usually two or more years ahead academically and two or three years behind socially . Van Reken broadens the concept of Third Culture Kids to include Cross-cultural kids and does so in a way that is scholarly and practical . This should be required reading for everyone interested in cross-cultural studies/cross cultural families and who would like to understand children reared cross-culturally within their own country and those reared outside their home country . Expatriates should read this book as well parents who are rearing children in a cross-cultural situation ( ethnic minority parents ; immigrant parents ; mixed race parents , parents who adopt from another nation , and parents who move often from one region of the U.S. to another . )	1
I purchased this dictionary to go along side of my study materials in the course , & # 34 ; Irish : A Complete Course for Beginners. & # 34 ; This dictionary is everything I hoped it would be .	1
Anyone interested in dog rescue should buy this book . I purchased a dozen of them and gave them to all the senior officers at my county 's animal control department ... one month later they deceided to review their behavioral evaluation process and stop euthenasing behavioral dogs until they were sure the dogs were getting a fair shake ... this book might have saved hundreds of dogs lives and that 's in only one county ... perhaps a dog patron might want to try the same thing in their city/county ! Please spay and neuter your pets and tell everyone to do the same thing ... the un-intended offspring of our companion animals do not deserve to be tossed on the side of the road , neglected , incarcerated and euthenized due to their owners negligence .	1
The photography in this book is beautiful . Ms. Scott captures the innate beauty and emotions of every dog she photographs . Just by looking at these dog faces , one can get a sense of the hardship , the longing , and the hope of these canines . The stories behind each dog gives them such depth and character . Of course , these stories leave the reader/viewer filled with emotions including sadness and joy , but most importantly , they provide a reminder of just how precious shelter dogs are and just how much they want and deserve to be loved. -- JohnC	1
This is an excellent book to help you develop your own first kit car . It will guide you step by step including how to weld , where to source parts , etc . It is an inspiring book !	1
This was a beautiful book about the struggles of one Palestinian boy as his life is filled with chaos and constant grief and how he strives to make not only his life better but to make life better for his family . This fiction book gives readers a glimpse into the violence , chaos , and oppression that has been happening in Palestine for quite some time.I completely lost myself in this book . I felt like Ichmad 's struggles were mine , and that his joys were mine . Michelle Cohen Corasanti masterfully writes a poignant tale that will open readers ' eyes and their hearts . This was definitely one of my favorite books of the year . I highly recommend that everyone read this book , you will not be disappointed . [ I received this book from a Librarything Member 's Giveaway . The content of my review is in no way affected by that . ]	1
This book is a good title to add to your pile for Middle Eastern studies . Written with a young boys voice , we find the hardships of his young life to be amazing . The conflicts of the Gaza area are stated realistically but as you move into the story you become shocked that families can be treated so harshly on both sides . The young man 's intellect is the gift that helps him rise above the circumstances of his life . Counterpoint being his younger brother who becomes bitter and thus more active in the violence of the area . I recommend this book and have passed it on .	1
I am no expert on the early history of book printing , just a curious bystander , so I ordered The Coming of the Book because it sounded interesting . ( I had already read Elizabeth Eisenstein'sThe Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe , which I enjoyed a great deal . ) So what can one say about a 50-year-old work that one has just read for the first time ? The Coming of the Book was conceived by co-author Lucien Febvre , one of the legendary founders of the French Annales approach to history . He died during its preparation , and it was completed by Henri-Jean Martin and published in French in 1958 . The translation by David Gerard was first published in 1976.In the Annales style , The Coming of the Book is laden with facts : people , places , dates . It boasts a 30-page index , the contents of which are almost all proper names . In the text these 15th and 16th century people fly by in what is , for me , a mind-numbing parade . The fact that it is a translation does not help its readability . The book is hard work.But the work is rewarded . The scope of The Coming of the Book is vast and its scholarship is remarkable . From the development of markets for paper to the diffusion of technical knowledge to specialized areas like finance , labor , and regulation , Febvre and Martin provide exhaustive documentation . But it is not only trees . The forest is there as well , in the relationship between publishing and academia , publishing and religion ( i.e. , the Reformation ) , and the shift from publishing `` the classics '' to publishing contemporary works.So should you read this book ? If you are new to the field it is not the place to start . Eisenstein 's volume ( see above ) is much more readable . But if you want to move on from there and are willing to put forth the effort , this one is itself a classic .	1
It was amazing to me that Israel was always cast as being in the right , and the Palestinians as being perfidious , low life , treacherous , unimaginative antagonists . How can things be so one-sided ? Finkelstein provides a simple answer . They are not as simple and one-sided as Americans have been led to believe . A few specifics : Israel was not uninhabited when the Jews came in . Quite the contrary , it was rather fully occupied by Palestinians . Rather unsurprisingly , they did not exactly welcome the Jews . For the Jews to come in , Palestinians whose families had lived there for generations had to leave . The Jews used terror and atrocities to drive them out . Where did they learn these terror and atrocity methods ? Simple . Hitler and Stalin had recently used them against the Jews . The ends justified horrific means.Israel 's wars against the Arabs , even starting with their war of liberation , were wars of aggression by the Arabs , but the other way around . Israel 's victories should be no surprise . They not only had the advantage in arms , they had the advantage of timing.I tended to overlook Israel 's failings because I admire the incredible competence of individual Jews . They are very smart and industrious people . However , these admirable virtues do not offset the unconscionable act of having stolen their land from people who had lived there for centuries . Their incredibly artful propaganda , stemming from a nation of lawyers , only compounds the crime . If anything , we should hold such talented people to higher standards than others . They let us down .	1
From the substantive topics of LATE VICTORIAN HOLOCAUSTS , namely El Nino induced droughts and famines that brought on agricultural collapse and socioeconomic disintegration in the tropics , there can be no doubting that the real subject of this book is misery . It 's presented here in such a well reasoned , thought provoking , and professional way that we do n't notice how deeply we 've dived into the miasma before we are too far gone and by then we ca n't put the book down.To put misery into context consider that between 1876 and 1900 there were a series of El Nino events that Mr Davis estimates caused between 32 to 61 million deaths in China , India and Brazil . It was not all climatalogical ( i.e floods and droughts ) , but also diseases such as malaria , smallpox , dysentry , and cholera . Mr Davis , in building the theoretical underpinnings for his book posits two explanations : ( 1 ) These societies had pre-existing agricultural and social systems that were capable of ameliorating the effects of the natural disasters . To the extent that the systems were now failing in the late Victorian era , Mr Davis traces this to the policies adopted by the governments of imperial China , colonial India , and Brazil . In short the trade , finance and economic practices of Europe , Britain and America , had , - long before it became a buzz-word - effectively achieved globalization . ( 2 ) This is not to say that Third World poverty is solely a result of imperialism . It is not , and that is n't Mr Davis ' argument . It is instead , he says , an issue of & quot ; political ecology. & quot ; This concept as developed by Mr Davis interestingly shows how individual actions are ultimately the principal causes but also how intricately they are linked to geopolitical factors.In summary Mr Davis seems to be saying that neither the market ( or the lack thereof ) , nor government influence , are solely sufficient in explaining the Third World . Political ecology offers a holistic approach and sees the individual as responsible , but with a nod to the influence of geopolitics . The political element of the equation is all the more important when you realize that in the the Third World , poor also means , poor in power .	1
In 1887-1888 , former President US Grant undertook a world tour . In stop after stop , Grant and his party witnessed scenes of famine and mass death . This was no coincidence , Nature and other scientific journals published accounts of approximately coincident famines circling the globe . Millions died . Remarkably , this global disaster was only one of three major world spanning famines in the final quarter of the 19th century , all with death tolls in the millions . The explanation for these events was not uncovered for decades . In the 1960s , Jacob Bjerknes of UCLA synthesized approximately a century of meterological and climatological data and speculation with his description of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) as a major driver of world weather . All the great 19th century famines were driven by weather events resulting from unusually strong ENSOs.Davis does a very nice job of describing the character and history of the discovery of the ENSO , the history of the devastating 19th century famines , and the evidence correlating ENSO changes with the famines . This is a model of integrating diverse scholarship to produce a synthesis with considerable explanatory power . These sections are very well written and leave the reader with powerful impressions of the world wide extent and severity of the famines.Davis also makes a strong and largely successful effort at further elaboration and synthesis by integrating the social and economic history of the 19th century into his discussions of the great famines . Davis argues that the development of the world economy under European hegemony resulted in a series of changes in many regions that altered traditional societies in ways that made these societies more vulnerable to the effects of El Nino events . The increasing emphasis on cash crops for the world market , for example , eroded traditional subsistence farming that offered some safeguards against famine . Davis documents this feature best for the case of colonial India , where he can draw on a critical literature dating back to the 19th century and where successive British administrations behaved abysmally.Davis also discusses several other societies impacted by the great famines , notably Qing China and Northeastern Brazil . Quite a few other regions are mentioned at least briefly . Davis has probably bitten off a bit too much in some of these sections . His effort to be comprehensive leads sometimes to superficial coverage.Davis takes considerable pains to rebut the traditional argument that these famines were a Malthusian consequence of over-population . This is the complement to his argument that the 19th century European imperialism greatly exacerbated the consequences of El Nino events . In the case of India and some other regions , like the Phillipines and Dutch dominated Java , he makes a very good case . In the case of China , his argument is less powerful . By his own account , the horrible vulnerability of China , particularly North China , stems more from ecological consequences of population growth in the 18th and early 19th century plus the decay of the power of the Qing state . In all fairness to Davis , British imperialism did contribute to the decline of the Qing state.Davis argues also with some force that the great famines contributed to the immiseration of China , India , and many other regions , contributing to the 20th century backwardness of the Third World . This is such an ambitious book that Davis is not always successful , especially in the second half fo the book , in presenting a complete story . Nonetheless , this is an unusually informative and even daring book .	1
It 's great to spend some time with some old friends - Conan Doyle , Wilde , ( contemporaries who shared a publisher ) Orwell , etc and a few new names , all given the inimitable Hitchens analysis . This is a different writer than the political one ; here CH is kind , sympathetic , understanding . As much as I have read , and read about the Victorian authors in these interesting essays on literature , there is yet something fresh and insightful in each cameo portrait . Ah , they just do n't write like this anymore ! Craftsmanship is fast disappearing from all types of work . Many people have never read a well-written novel ; many have never seen a well-made piece of literary criticism . One may have both by picking up this collection of essays and following Hitchens to any of these authors.The title refers to a quotation by Shelley : `` Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world . `` And on a personal note , many thanks to my Amazon Friends and others who have appreciated my reviews and comments here . There will be many more reviews as I write them , no comments , but you know how to reach me if you wish .	1
John Pilger details in four case study essays , the means by which the strongest western nations hold life and death powers over millions living in the world , and how those powers , through a mixture a of corporate , military , and state `` Imperialism '' are routinely misused when it 's one rule for the `` big boys '' , and another rule for the rest.Essay one retraces Indonesia 's bloody initiation into the global corporate market through the western support of it 's murderous dictator , General Suharto , who , after taking control , literally opened the gates to the flood of corporations who took control of the country 's vast resources . Billions were `` lost '' from the `` loans '' provided by the World Bank and IMF which today are literally impossible to repay . Indonesia 's working poor , living on less than two dollars a day , and who work and live in intolerable conditions , have inherited this burden from a regime that was supported by the west for becoming `` democratized '' .Essay two focuses mainly on the 13 years of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq and the devastating impact on its people . The skyrocketing cancer rate , especially among children , is largely attributed to the 300 tons of Depleted Uranium left to blow in the winds and settle in the drinking water after the Gulf War . The manipulations of the US and Sanctions Committee , which routinely delayed or even denied certain cancer treating medicines , pain killers , or even desperately needed hospital equipment is nothing short of obscene.Pilger examines the means by which economic and political exploitations have been used over the years to keep the disparity of nations on an uneven keel , and the western public largely misinformed . The contradictions of words versus practice , hypocrisy of policy , and just plain bullying have resulted in the biggest `` rigged game '' ever with humanity paying the ultimate price.Finally he examines Australia to reveal behind the modern faade of a wealthy westernized nation , one who ranks among the lowest in the world with respect to infant mortality rate of it 's indigenous population , and tries to front an integrated image while the country 's Aboriginal people are force to live under apartheid like conditions.In each essay , the numbers who paid the price are staggering , the story shameful , and as history reveals , nothing short of genocide . By comparison , the carnage left in the wake of the strongest nations corporate , state , and military plunders , backed by the 'moral leaders ' of yesteryear and today , makes the world 's second baddest boogie man , Saddam , look like a fledgling novice .	1
Patrice Lumumba was a symbol for all that is despised by the Imperialistic West . A nation that was so rich with resources that the Congo could n't POSSIBLY be left to its own independence . Lumumba was a people 's leader . He had the following of the masses . He was an inspiration to not only the people of the Congo , but to many around the world , particularly in Africa during this time when many countries on the continent were throwing off the yoke of imperialism . It can be said that with Lumumba 's assassination , that the period of African neo-colonialism officially began . This particular case of outright murder was a combined effort with Belgium , French and American interests . De Witte does an excellent job exposing this injustice for what it was ... an attempt by the West to yet again meddle in the affairs of third world nations trying to maintain sovereignty and independence . In this case they were successful . Lumumba simply did not have enough time to prepare a solid nationalistic foundation in the Congo . Brussels thought that they would have much longer to move out of the nation , but realized that with the immense popularity of Lumumba , that they would have to move much faster , and would have to do so in a way that would place the blame on a few drunken Congolese enemies of Lumumba looking to stage a coup . It was only with the writing of this book that opinions began to change . In fact , this book had such an impact , that the Belgian Parliament ordered an official investigation into the murders of Lumumba and his 2 aides on that fateful day in January of 1961 . We have yet to see justice done in the Congo , and because of the meddling of the West , Mobutu amassed a huge personal fortune while reducing his nation and his people to poverty at the gain of the West . Lumumba is an inspiration to revolutionaries and anti-imperialists throughout the world as he had the courage to stand up and become a martyr for his country and spit in the face of those who had no business being in his country after June 30 , 1960 .	1
A laser-sharp , fly-on-the-wall encounter with John Lennon at 30 . He stops being The Beatle , The Genius , The Legend and becomes instead a guy who has seen and lived some very strange stuff . You feel for him and you see him finally as a kind of savant : He was an average guy with huge pockets of talent and pain who was body-surfing the tidal wave of his own life . BOTTOM LINE : The closest any of us will ever get to talking to the guy . You 'll love it .	1
As a father of six kids , I 'm constantly on the look out for another Bible story book . `` The Candle Classic Bible '' from Candle Books ( distributed in the US by Kregel ) is a fine addition to my collection . This kids ' book has the look and feel of a leather bound , weather-worn classic . It is beautifully illustrated and has a gold sheen on each page . The stories are short but follow the Scripture account well . And the volume comes complete with a ribbon and a full color illustration on the front.Some kids Bible story books are given to fancy and invention . Others seem to trivialize the text . This has the right blend of contextualizing the story for kids but staying true to the text . I appreciated that several of the less common stories made their way into this collection . It is divided into 365 stories , but I felt that much of the time the story would span two or even three of the daily readings . The Scripture references are included for each story which will invite the family to open up the real Bible and read the fuller account.The size of the book and its heft-it weighs in at nearly two pounds-will allow this book to endure the frequent use its colorful pages will invite . It is bound to be a family favorite , and I would be glad to see it end up on the shelves of Christians everywhere.Disclaimer : This book was provided by Kregel Publications . I was under no obligation to offer a favorable review .	1
The David Sticker Book written by Karen Williamson and illustrated by Amanda Enright is a great interactive story for your preschooler . What could be better than lots of stickers and the story of King David ? As you read the story to your little one , they can place the stickers on the picture . They will be drawn into the story of David 's life by the adorable illustrations and the text is written so they can easily understand.But for me , the $ 5.99 price tag ( printed on the back ) is a tad high for such a thin book for children . Admittedly , my husband and 3 year had a lot of fun putting the stickers in this book and reading it together . So maybe that alone could make it worth the price.Also , the book very quickly covers the span of David 's life , but I would have liked to at least have seen a reference to David 's importance in light of the eventual coming of Christ the Messiah . I know that is being picky , but just thought I would throw that in.4 out of 5 starsI received a free copy of this book from Kregel Publishers in exchange for a fair and honest review .	1

When I began to read this book the first thing I thought of was how cute it was . The short stories are beautifully told and the illustrations are also beautiful . This is the kind of book that should be kept on a child 's bedside and should be shared with others who have young children who are teaching them about the Bible . The stories are told in very easy to understand language for chlidren . I was given this book by Kregel Publishers for the purpose of a review and all opinions are my own .	1
Candle Bedtime Bible features stories from the New Testament and Old Testament broken down into three , five , and ten minute stories for children . There are cute little sheep with a colored clock on their tummies located at the header of each story to help you with your reading selection.I & # 8217 ; ve used this book around all three of my children . My youngest at three likes the illustrations , which are cute , but sometimes can not sit through the 10 minute stories . My other two at five and seven , like the stories and my oldest does some reading on her own . I think this book would be ideal for 4-7-year-olds . The age suggested is 3-5 so I would differ a bit on the recommended age.Candle Bedtime Bible includes 42 stories and is 160 pages . The stories begin with the story of creation and end around the time of Ascension Day . The images are cute and childlike and the reading seems fairly accurate to the time labels . I would just up the recommended age a bit , otherwise a nice way to share valuable stories with your child before bedtime.Disclosure : I received this book free of charge in exchange for a review from Kregel Publications .	1
My three year old daughter Paige loves painting and I 'm happy for her to have anything relating to the Bible so I was thrilled to give her the Bible Stories Painting Book 2.This book is different from any other that I 've seen in that it actually includes a paint palette with it . As a mom I loved the convenience of this ! It 's one less thing to have to get out in order for her to get started . There are two pages of paint in the front and two in the back so it 's a nice selection for them to choose from.I showed Paige how to wet her brush and get the paint off the pages and she was off and painting ! Each page is a different Bible story so not only was it a chance for her to express herself creatively ; it was also an opportunity for me to go over these stories with her.I love the idea of everything being included in one book practically speaking . However , the paint was so light , she had to keep going over the same spot to get it darker . I think this is true of water colors in general but these were even lighter than usual.Bible Stories Painting Book 2 is a great way to discuss Bible stories with your children and handy to have around without having to pull supplies from all different places .	1
This book is really good if you have been frustrated by having to learn musical notation and the & quot ; proper & quot ; way of doing things..There is nothing wrong with learning everything , but some of us want to learn to play just for fun and will probably never be a virtuouso ... It also teaches you to make your own music rather than only becoming good at playing other peoples stuff .	1
As the song says , Deborah Harry looks good in blue-or wearing about anything , or , as shown in other photo essays but not this one , nothing at all.Within the first few pages , Mick Rock discusses one key aspect of the Harry iconography : although their facial structures are almost utterly different , Debbie manages to almost eerily evoke the image of her idol , the late Marilyn Monroe . Indeed , she does so far better than does Madonna ( who made a much more conscious and public effort to do so ) or Gwen Stefani , both of whom have more similarity in facial shape . Debbie has an unusually large cranial structure and an extremely wide face , factors that make her universally admired looks even more remarkable . Unfortunately , Rock fails to effectively deal with the issue , but this is of tertiary importance in a book that could as easily have no words at all.Rock is a thoroughly competent photographer by the standards of rock journalism , but he 's no Sam Shaw , Cecil Beaton , George Barris , Eve Arnold , or any of the other classic era Leica/Rollei wielding pre-papparazi photographers , who made enduring idols not only of MM but so many of the other Classic Era actresses . As a result , a hundred years from now these images will probably be reviewed with interest , but not the unadulterated awe one might give to classic images of MM , Cyd Charisse , Ava Gardner , Audrey Hepburn , Elizabeth Taylor or others , none of whom-even the now-canonized Monroe-were objectively `` more beautiful '' than Harry.These images-taken from too few photo shoots-are fine photographs on their own , and a fine document of Deborah Harry , who is a first-rate vocalist and a fine character actress who , unlike a lot of rock-and-roll stars , might have been as successful as _almost_ any of her childhood idols in the worlds of film and music in the pre-rock-and-antihero 40s and 50s and early 60s , before an awful August night in Brentwood and an equally bad November afternoon in Dallas turned a decade-and a nation-disillusioned and sour.Deborah Harry is , almost everywhere except her own country , a major league rock star , and this book is a decent exposition of part of the reason why : she 's a stunning-looking woman who can effectively employ everything she 's got . The other lies in her music , both the `` classic five '' Blondie albums and her daring and eminently competent modern jazz and standards work with the Jazz Passengers , Stewart Copeland , and others . If you have a backward cousin in , say , Kansas City , who thinks that rock and roll means boring and dopey AOR warhorses like REO Speedwagon , Styx , and Rush , this book and a couple of Blondie albums might do him , or her , a lot of good next holiday season .	1
Although I could have asked for more examples , this book was well worth the money . The book goes from the very basic up to a fairly complex development . Easy to read and follow	1
I checked out several books on VB6 trying to get information on VB6 and Database programming . Having had good experiences with WROX books in the past , I tried this one . Excellent ! The way it 's written it 's easy to follow as well as NOT boring . The way the book is written , information in earlier chapters is built on in later chapters . It 's a good reference tool as well . It 's like a tutorial as well as a reference book all in one . It 's easy to go back and review something because of the way the information has been layed out.The only part I could n't find was information for connectivity , for a compiled program , to a database if it 's been moved . Other than that , it 's the best of the 8 ( yes 8 ) books that I looked at ... the other 7 were returned .	1
Boy , my reviews of Wrox books probably seem a little boring , since there is so little fault to find with them . The Wrox programming books are really the best books on the market , and it 's interesting that the Oreilly books have n't yet published a decent book on php or xml stuff . I liked the way this PHP book explained the various setup options and the amount of space discussing mysql ( which is a major reason why people are using php anyway ) .What distinguishes this book from the rest are the examples . The tutorial part of the book works with two simple projects , an online job app and an address book , which were easy enough to follow . Actually , I found this book to be a useful intro to cgi script writing in addition to php.Also interesting were 4 case studies about ways to use php . Example : did you know that with the qt libraries , php can manipulate images ( such as zooming , and overwriting images with text ) ? That is amazing ! A chapter on phorum explains how a discussion software uses php , and another one explains the use of a shopping cart ( I tend to agree with the other reader who thinks that this is not necessarily the best example to use ) . The book also describes other things like using php for file management and storage , email configuration , and network connections . Some other topics covered in depth include : xml , security and database integration.The appendix has many things . First , obviously , it has an alphabetical list of all the php functions . It also has a helpful appendix on http headers and another on browser support of html tags . This last thing is only somewhat handy to have , because web developers reading this book are past the point of needing browser support info re legacy html tags . Instead developers should be worrying about xml and xslt . Some technical books increase the size of their book by stuffing a lot of code throughout it . Wrox seems to like to increase the size by including large and somewhat irrelevant appendices.This book made me realize many new potential ways in which php could be used . That is the most valuable thing about the book . I have not tried very much of the code , so I ca n't comment on whether it all works . But ( to summarize ) it will really broaden your horizons of what php is capable of.The only reason I 've given it 4 stars is that I have n't read the whole thing yet .	1
... Anyways , I bought this book because I urgently wanted to learn PHP and use it with mysql for a web site , and it was great . You learn the syntax of PHP , and then there are a variety of tutorials on the different capabilties of PHP , including database and image editing ( this is actually really cool ) . Then at the end there are 4 sample full-blown programs that are explained and available for download at the book 's website ( as well as all the source code throughout the book ) . These include a web forum script , a send mail script , etc.As great as this book is , I would n't recommend it to someone with no programming experience though since the explanations are very concise and thus brief . But anyways , one should not learn PHP as a first language as it is very limited to web uses unlike other scripting languages such as Python .	1
Update 02-26-2010 : I threw this book out a few months ago even though it had all my notes written on the pages . I wish I had it back . I would downloaded and would like to learn the new est version . There are n't many books on the shelf for computers anymore - especially for programming . I still feel perl is a great language for digging data our of log files etc.Update 04-24-08 : I will likely be dusting this book off and bring it in to work . The notes I wrote in it make it invaluable to me . There is a new version too . UltraEdit is a great text editor and only costs $ 50 for the latest and greatest text version of the program.I spent a year with the book and went through almost every chapter in detail . I typed in nearly every chapter , wrote notes in the book , etc.It 's not perfect and falls a little short occasionally in the area of being pro-active . By this I mean there are some areas where the author could have emphasized things a bit more.Also , he makes it seem like learning PERL is a breeze . I found it a lot of work after spending 2000 hrs with the book . I can can code pretty well and consider myself an intermediate non-professional . This language is an outstanding way to learning advanced programming techniques common to all languages . It is also something I will use as I move from windows 2k/xp to Mac OS X Tiger - which has perl built in and is accessible through the Terminal.app window.Bottom line : if you have a need to manipulate text based data files or even excel - since there are many plugins for Perl or want to do Web cgi scripts this is a great book although it does not focus on web applications but primarily on the building blocks of text manipulation and general programming fundamentals , loops , statements , troubleshooting , etc you can not go wrong with this book . Also , do n't be fooled by its size . It is the right size instead of a giant telephone book that you will never read like most programming books . Also , much more helpful for learning than the Perl in a nutshell classic O'reilly book .	1
Occasionally I have the need to leave my IBM/Lotus programming platform and interact with data stored in Microsoft SQL Server 2000 . I even have it running on my laptop as a higher-end alternative to Access . I found that the book , Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming by Robert Vieira ( Wrox ) is a very good reference for manipulating data in that environment.Vieira concentrates specifically on the programming aspects of SQL Server 2000 as opposed to teaching you how to administer the server . He does touch on an administration overview in chapter 30 , but it 's not something you 'd read in order to pass an administration exam . Although the title does say & quot ; Professional & quot ; , this does not mean you have to be a veteran SQL programmer to benefit from it . The earlier chapters cover the fundamentals of RDBMS technology , as well as how SQL is used in a SQL Server 2000 environment . The further you get into the book , the more you 'll find subjects that are either more advanced or cover techniques you 'll use in application development , such as how to build triggers and stored procedures . While you will learn all these skills within the SQL Server 2000 platform , the core technologies are transferable to just about any RDBMS . Time spent with this book will continue to pay off regardless of what database system you need to use at any given time.While the content is technical , the writing style is conversational and approachable . It 's actually quite easy to read the material and digest the concepts without trying to fight against the author 's style . If you have need to work with SQL Server 2000 from a development standpoint , this is definitely a book to consider to guide you along the way .	1
I must own a dozen or more of these red-cover books from Wrox , and this one continues to meet the high standards of readability and thoroughness I have come to expect from the publisher.A great first book on PostgreSQL , the frequent & quot ; Try it Out & quot ; sections make it quite suitable for self-study .	1
In THE ROSE OF ENCHANTMENT Kianna falls in love with a handsome rogue , Jason Bradford and through her sweetness and beauty she makes him realize he should be married - to her - and quit his single ways . But , he 's unused to his feelings and he acts really jealous . In fact , he tried to deny his feelings in the beginning , saying he would end up hurting her because she was so innocent , and also that he was too old for her ; he was 32 and she was only 18 , but this kind of age difference is common in a lot of romance novels . And a look back in America 's history shows us that this is n't unusual at all . I think today it would be , though . Anyway , it 's a great , great story , and I was sad to see it end .	1
I am an experienced miniaturist of many years , and I checked this book out at the public library first to see if I wanted to get it . I thought it was fantastic , so I bought it from Amazon . These foods are largely universal although the Englishness of a couple of them is interesting , like the pork pie . I appreciated the instructions on how to do polymer clay seafood ( where else can you find directions on how to make a fish skeleton with a fishhead attached ? ? ) , and I also liked the instructions on how to make mini dishware to go with the foods .	1
This is an Ireland author with alot of Irish History . The nice thing is her knitting is not your standard american knitting . Some of the patterns are surprisingly easy with wow effect ! Some are alot more challenging but worth the effort .	1
Both this and number 2 are probably the best collection of tea cozies I have found , and of the several I have made for gifts they have proved to be winners . Very clear instructions also .	1
I ca n't wait to get stuck in and make some of these tiny treats . It all looks so easy to make - I am impressed by the simple but detailed instructions .	1
This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a wire work book ! I was n't able to preview the inside of the book , so I took a chance and luckily it paid off . I have many books on jewelry making and wire working . Most of the projects are n't ones I 'm crazy about or they 're too simple or too 'out there ' . This book is perfect . Some of the techniques and projects are more basic , but the level of advancement goes up quite a bit and every one of the projects is beautiful and useful ! ! ! This is the book to purchase if you 'd like some nicely detailed , beautiful projects for wire working . It 's worth more than the cover price , since you could easily spend this much or more just buying a couple on on-line tutorials . I would give this book 10 stars if I could ! It 's one of the best I 've ever seen in the jewelry making category .	1
Great book with so many different styles of the age old granny square.Easy direction and diagrams with beautiful color pictures ! !	1
The projects in this book are beautiful , and the overall instructions are quite helpful . There is a nice variety of projects , and I want to make several of them , no doubt . I waited anxiously for this book , and think I will use it often . The only reason I gave it four stars is that the copy I got uses UK terminology for stitches . There is a conversion chart , but I will have to remember to convert to US stitches . Otherwise , beautiful .	1
Like all of the book sin the Europa Militaire series , this volume is a wonderful source of color images of period uniforms and gear . While some of the models are a bit stiffly posed , and some more action-oriented shots would have been in order , I highly recommend this to any students of WWI or military uniforms.I also recommend the entire series . Some of the volumes also feature colour photos of historical re-enactors as well as models and all have fairly well-researched text , too .	1
It 's always irritating when narcissism does not equal stupidity and this book is an excellent example . Tarkovsky is a filmmaker that often requires a learned scholar to explain because while his dialogue is very didactic , the thematic qualities are extremely subtle . In addition , Tarkovsky 's personal subjective life experience in a non-Western culture can be inscrutable for lots of film students who are used to the Western habit of psychoanalytic , formalist , feminist , New Critical , and Marxist interpretations of films . Or what David Bordwell calls `` SLAB '' theory ( Saussure , Lacan , Althusser & Barthes ) .Robert Bird fits the bill of learned scholar and it shows well , but unfortunately , no one is more aware of this than him . Bird loves the sound of his own voice and is earnest to the point of pretension in structuring the chapters . Reading this book reminded me of dozens of film studies books so thoroughly riddled with 50-cent words of academic foundation that you can read a sentence three times over and not understand what it means . And because Bird feels so strongly about his opinions , he ca n't help but include his own voice along for the entire breadth of the tome in a way that is so invasive and distracting that I had a mind to give up before I even finished the introduction ! It 's like reading a book with the author over your shoulder , interrupting you to explain what he was thinking when he wrote the sentence you 're on.Annoying as he is , Bird is no idiot . What astonished me is how a writer this self-important could be so admirably thorough and selfless on the subject . The book is EXTREMELY well-researched , heavily cited , and the bibliography is far more extensive than a book this size usually is . He even manages to find reference and research material that probably could n't be found without going to Russia and examining Tarkovsky 's personal effects . Bird 's arguments are consistent , and they have a strong enough familiarity with Russian culture and aesthetics to be insightful in a way that most other writers on Tarkovsky overlook or fail to grasp at all.I definitely learned a great deal about Tarkovsky that I would certainly have never divined on my own . The only drawback was having to listen to Bird 's dramatic , obfuscating presence the entire way . Thankfully though , the introduction is really the worst part of that tone and he does put himself aside to make room for Tarkovsky as the book goes on.It 's definitely worth reading and studying , but be prepared for Bird 's academic pomposity to flavor the tone .	1
This book is extremely entertaining.It is a highly readable account of a complex set of circumstances.The author does an excellent job of explaining various points of view of the subject throughout history , as well as various opinions expressed by people in a variety of fields.About half of the book was the author 's narrative devoted to recounting his involvement in the resolution of a particular theft.The second part of the book was dedicated to an overview of similar famous cases.The author presented a well-rounded , well-researched discussion regarding various theories of the motivations behind art crime , and how they are affected by changing trends in markets and societies.The bibliography is impressive . I highly recommend this great read .	1
I love this book . Let me tell you a bit about myself ; I have been told , my entire life how attractive I am by men and women , and yet , I always seem to end up with a broken heart . Of course , the men that I am not interested in chase me like crazy , but I do n't want them , so it has always annoyed me and made me uncomfortable , and made me wonder ... gosh how do I get the men that I WANT to act like the men that I DO N'T want ? What is the key ? The men that I do want , always seem to be unattainable ... . or , when I do get them , I get so nervous and try so hard that they eventually dump me . I have always marvelled at women who , physically , were less attractive than me , get the men that I wanted ! I never understood it ... until now . Look , I am not looking to use men or break anyone 's heart , I just need an answer to my own heartbreaks and insecurities and nervousness around men that I really want to be in a relationship with . I do n't want to be used , and I do n't want to hurt anyone . This book is very empowering . It takes you out of your nervousness and puts you in your head , in control . It is like having something to occupy your mind when you are nervous ... instead of using that nervous energy agains yourself , you have a plan , you are prepared , you can succeed . Think about our military , our police force , our fire departments ... they train , and train , and train , so that when they are in those tough situations , they do n't have time to panic and make a mistake that could cost them their lives , they fall back on their training and they are able to do courageous and amazing things . This book is a training manual . Not a training manual to manipulate , or hurt , but a manual to give you confidence and something to think about when you are about to ; once again ... blow it . This is a very important book here , we are talking about our lives . Finding love and happiness in a relationship is one of the most important thing in life ... why not use a manual to help you do that ? I do n't agree with the critics who say that it helps people `` manipulate '' . Not true . We all naturally manipulate , we are all children really , just trying to figure out how to get what we want ... most of us just end up going about in a way that hurts us and hurts others . This helps us find love and keep love and keep it exciting . I especially loved chapter 20 : `` Mix pleasure and pain . '' It is okay to not be nice all the time ! It is so exhausting to try so hard not to upset people and not to want to displease people ... . only to find out that it has been backfiring ! Of course you want to be sweet , but it is okay to speak your mind and stand up for yourself ... not only is it okay , but it is attractive to the opposite sex . I am so glad that I bought this book . It is very freeing , honestly , this is a great book and an easy and entertaining read , but most importantly , can instill confindence and help to create a stronger person . *note* ha ha ... . I have noticed a lot of things in this book that men have used on me ! Now I know ... ... .. also empowering . Knowledge IS power : )	1
In the late 80 's , when Phantom was in it 's glory -- and still is -- George Perry wrote and collaborated with the stars of the original cast , Andrew Lloyd Webber , and historians to create an amazing companion to the musical , it was called `` The Complete Phantom of the Opera '' . It 's practially the bible to all things Phantom that you want to know about . Most importantly what you want to know about the original cast.It seems though they have copied pages of George Perry 's Phantom book , edited/shortened them , placed them in this book with all new pictures and , of course , details on the movie.It 's a good buy if you are looking for information on the movie , or pictures -- I found it lacking in the `` creating '' of the movie and the interviews with the cast , though . It also includes the original Screenplay from 1990 when they were going to film the movie.Also , instead of a lot of London Cast pictures , there are now pictures from other casts , other countries around the world . They are truly beautiful.All in all , it 's a fantastic buy . But if you are looking for more information , best wait until a better book that is thicker , and chocked full of more Phantom knowledge .	1
good , and exciting work . The seller was true to his word and everything was as described . It is a great book with great details about how to accomplish the work as described .	1
Although you ca n't `` Look Inside '' this book at Amazon ( currently , anyhow ) , the cover is exactly representative of the projects inside . This is no encyclopedia of a billion stitches , but a book focused tightly upon reproducing Redoute 's beautiful botanical prints in `` thread painting . `` There were several things about this book that stood out for me : Not the Kitchen Sink -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Trish Burr wisely restricts herself to a relatively few stitches : long-and-short , satin , stem , split , bullion knot , French knot , and perhaps a couple more . They are presented clearly , in diagrams and words ( and photos in some cases ) , and followed by a small sampler . Then come the Redoute projects ... Clear Presentation -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Each flower ( there are 17 ) is presented in the same format : - First , a large-scale photograph of the stitched piece , along with a list of needles and other materials.- Then , three line drawings : one for the pattern outlines , one to define which areas are padded or detailed , and one to show color placement.- Another , smaller photograph on the same page spread as the diagrams- A verbal explanation gives details on stitching each part of the flower : which stitches , in what order , how many strands.Ms . Burr writes in her Introduction that she aims for clear illustrations and good explanations , and she has achieved her target admirably . Although the format as I 've described it may sound repetitive , I found it refreshing not to have to flip back and forth between pages , searching for color keys or stitch info -- and equally refreshing not to have all the directions crammed into one cryptic diagram . ( Anyone who has ever struggled to decode the projects in `` A to Z of Ribbon Embroidery '' , for instance , knows what I mean . Sumptuous photos of the projects , but figuring out how to reproduce them is murder . ) Unusual Selection of Subjects -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -It 's easy to find embroidery books on English flowers , and many of them are truly gorgeous ( Helen Stevens ' Masterclass series comes to mind ) , but if you 're looking for something different , something ... well , something French ! , this may be just the thing for you . Instead of pinks and cornflowers and foxgloves , here are lilies and iris and camellias and magnolias . Roses , morning-glories , and a few exotics like amaryllis , bird-of-paradise , and poppy are also represented . Again , the cover illustration gives a good idea of what you 'll find inside . It ai n't no cottage garden ! Achievable -- -- -- -- -- All projects are stitched using easily available DMC embroidery floss . None of the stitches are jazzy or difficult . The instructions are so clear that even a relative novice should be able to achieve exciting results . ( Again , Helen Stevens comes to mind , but alas , as a counterexample . I love looking at her books , but they have never given me the slightest bit of confidence that I could do work like that . ) =============All in all , an excellent book , well worth the money . Bravo , Ms. Burr !	1
Want to know what to do with all of your small bits and pieces of yarn ? This book will take you step by step and show you how to use colors and create a piece of art . Do n't miss this one .	1
Easy understanding how to do stitches . Great practice items to work on . Will greatly increase you skill . Worth the buy	1
This book is really great , just love it ! Good instructions , ca n't wait to get started on some projects , the birds are so cute .	1
Shading with cotton or silk embroidery thread to make lifelike flora and fauna is a recommended technique for the aspiring and advanced embroiderer . Combining colors to make this happen is often a bigger challenge than the stitching techniques . Many people struggle with the intricacies of the color wheel and the differences between tone , value and hue when it comes to color - including me . Trish Burr has made all of that easy with a book that is visual rather than analytical . The first chapters have the review of materials and techniques that all good instruction manuals have , but then Trish Burr combines the colors for you , first in charts , with reference to both DMC and Anchor Thread numbers and then in lovely miniature projects that would be at home either on their own , on a crazy quilt or as part of a larger project . The possibilities are endless.Trish Burr has made color theory and color combination accessible and visual in this book and it is a prize indeed . I note that it is sold out on amazon at the moment and there is a reason for this : Burr makes color intuitive rather than intellectual and I believe this book may prompt many fiber people to finally understand that color wheel - but even if they do n't they will be able to combine colors for embroidery and other fiber projects . Truly a quiet masterpiece that will give needleworkers more practical confidence with color than almost any other work . Recommended .	1
I thought this was going to be yet another book trying to teach me the color wheel and various analogous or split-complementary harmonies . How wonderful that it 's not ! The first few chapters are basics of Trish Burr , fabric , needles , shading , etc.Then the rest of the first half of the book is full color lists of DMC thread colors that go together..with DMC numbers . Page after pager of colors that combine . No color wheels ! no harmonies ! For some , she stitched a flower with each petal showing various colors shaded and/or combined ( with DMC numbers given ) . You want an antique effect , turn to the antique page and there are stitched color combinations to chose from . Not sure what colors you want , leaf through the full color pages until you find a combination that calls to you.The second half of the book is projects . I do have a small issue with Ms. Burr 's projects , both in this book and in Needle Painting . I have found numerous projects that tell you to stitch every flower petal in A , B , C , D order . Yet the stitched example by Ms. Burr is not in that order , she mixes up the colors on her pieces , while the project directions clearly have you do each petal the same . Only after my first project clearly was not looking like her 's , did I see how she tells you to do one thing , while doing another . I do n't do a lot of other peoples art , so while I find it odd that she 'd do this , and question why , it 's not a big deal to me.Another thing I love is that the book is much bigger than I thought . I expected something the size of Needle Painting . This is big . In full color . With wonderful paper that I find myself gliding my hands over . Wonderful .	1
Ben Law is a hilarious writer although some of these stories are very sad . I have visited several of the countries he has shows though his original , erudite lens.I recommend this book to anyone interested in the societies of Australia 's neighbours .	1
I really enjoyed reading this book . I have read several of William 's books before and I finally got round to reading this as I 'm off to Xanadu later this year.The author describes his journey from the Middle East to China overland and the book is already one of my favourite travel books - he has a great style and William 's historical knowledge meant that I also learnt a lot . Not bad for a book published by a 22-year-old !	1
Barb & Ken Knight 's baby girl Kathy grew up to be a gramma and one mean piece of work . Having honed the art of killing , knifing , slicing , and dicing to a fine art prior to the closing of the abattoir in Aberdeen , Australia , she turned her vocational training to the man she thought done her wrong - making a meal of which Hannibal Lector himself would have been happy to partake . The scariest part is that Kathy 's real.Peter Lalor , local journalist , has done a fine work of writing about the lives and times of the Knights , the crimes , the victims , and the Aussie Law and Order folk . Of Kathy 's piece de resistance , he aptly sums : `` it was a crime that would have appalled Edgar Allan Poe and humbled the imaginings of Stephen King . `` As should be with all books in the True Crime genre , there are orientating photos in the center . For the non-local reader , a map of New South Wales would have been welcome , as would a glossary in the back : tip = dump ? Chooks = chickens ? And what to make of this sentence : `` Bob Price has an esky in a car in the carpark and is topping up constantly . '' Nonetheless , an excellent account of a terrible true tale . /TundraVision , Amazon US reviewer .	1
I absolutely loved this book . I read it with amazement as I compared the events of my time in Zimbabwe to the behind the scenes information presented in the book . I was amazed at just how much was never put on air for the general public to be aware of and also to know the depth of the people 's convictions ( even when they are wrong ) and their willingness to act it out was very intriguing to me . Well written book I even learnt some things about my history I was unaware of . I ca n't wait for the next book .	1
Was fantastic.We have just returned from The South Island and found lots of location sights.I reckon it saved us money on some tours that do n't take you to the spots mentioned anyway . Wil use it when we go to North Island Ca n't wait	1
Inside the pagan community and without there is an on going debate as to the origins of gardenerian Wicca . On one side of the debate you have authors like Heselton and Whitmore who believe that Wicca is an ancient pre-christian religion that centered on a Goddess and God . On the other side you have authors like Ronald Hutton and Aidan Kelly and Tanya Lurman will maintain that Wicca is a new religious movement . Aidan Kelly & # 8217 ; s perspective is unique because he is in fact an insider who practices witch craft . Dr. Kelley invented his own tradition of witchcraft with some other students in Sand Francisco . He was one of the founding members of the New Reformed Order of the Golden Dawn.Since he himself has founded his own , or at least helped found his own witchcraft tradition , he finds nothing wrong with what Gerald Gardner did . In fact it is a sign of healthy society that shows spark of creativity . At one point all religions were man made and at one point they were new religious movements . Many religious movements whither and die it is only those few that meet the needs of the people that end up surviving . Judaism , Islam and Christianity are examples and so is Wicca . The number of Wiccans and Pagans doubles up every two years.Gerald Gardner made many false claims implying that Wicca was an ancient religion . Of course when new religious movements come about they will often claim they are the original or the corrected version that people are supposed to follow . All religions start this way . Most follower identify this and just live with the fact that historical reality and mythos are not necessarily the same.Aidan Kelley put the written works thorugh a scholarly test to determine if there was any truth to Gerald Gardner & # 8217 ; s claims . Searching through Gardner & # 8217 ; s belonging kept by Ripley & # 8217 ; s museum of witchcraft and documents held by Carl Wesche he was able to determine through careful analysis and detective work that Gardner & # 8217 ; s claims were false . Among the papers he found several versions of the same ritual often with dyslexic spelling and cross outs . Many of the rituals had undergone revision . These are the signs of authorship not copying something down from a book of shadows . Almost all of gardners works were direct plagiarisms . Elements were lifted dire tly out of Crowley & # 8217 ; s works , Lelands Aradia , Rudyard kipolings work etc . Doreen Valiente saw this and when she was intiated she rewrote almost all of it.One things that Aidan makes note of is Gereald & # 8217 ; s interesting in spanking and bondage . His new religion sanctified it . The book does a good job of telling the background story of Wicca and how Gerald Created it . I think Hutton & # 8217 ; s book is more complete though . Inventing Witchcraft tends to over do on printing in the text and analyzing it.In the end after all my research I have come to the conclusion that Gerald Gardner did in fact invent Wicca from available sources . His witchcraft is very much influenced by Ceremonial Magiack . However I do believe that there were precedents about for following witchcraft and following the Goddess that Gardner was not expose to . I enjoyed the historical excursion .	1
Chip Crockett 's Christmas Carol by Elizabeth HandI wanted to read this book because the proceeds will go towards a fund of a special education teacher that died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown , CT a year ago . At that time I was traveling through upstate NY and when I got the call from my brother in RI I could n't believe the tragedy and so close to Christmas.Brendan and Teri have split up and their son Peter attends a specialized school . Brendan has Peter many nights and is able to pick him up after school . Tony wants to move in with Brendan til he gets on his feet . The death of Chip has got all of them talking of the death and remembering the episodes on TV.Very patient to teach his son how to do just the simplest of tasks , repetitious patterned behavior.Thanksgiving at Kevin and Eileens house..then the drinking started . Things used to be normal til the drinking overtook everything.Story is based on Chip and how they can resurrect the puppet show of the 60 's . The year the doctors figured out what was wrong with Peter , that was the end of Christmas for Brendan.Christmas morning brings the miracle that ties this whole book together . Authors other works are highlighted at the end.I myself was too young to remember watching the show but other things I do recall , especially the TV screen after 2am and the countdown to a show broadcasting.I received this book from Net Galley in exchange for my honest review .	1
`` Worship in the Melting Pot '' was written by Dr. Peter Masters , the pastor of the world famous Metropolitan Tabernacle since 1970 . The Metropolitan Tabernacle was the church which C. H. Spurgeon pastored in the 19th century . Metropolitan Tabernacle has continued in the Baptist tradition of simplicity and predictability in its worship , which is in stark contrast to the pre-Reformation aesthetic ( visual and/or physical ) worship of Roman Catholicism and the post-modern ecstatic ( feeling oriented ) and profane ( worldly ) worship of Charismaticism and Evangelicalism.Dr . Masters set out to answer questions such as the following : `` What 's the matter with contemporary music groups ? Is n't there every kind of instrument , including percussion , in the Psalms ? Did n't they dance in worship in the Bible times ? '' ( p. 9 ) . He aimed to `` focus on the four great pillars of worship -- the principles which the Bible insists on '' ( p. 9 ) .Dr . Masters primary text for worship centered around Jesus ' answer to the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4:23-24 : `` God is Spirit , and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth . '' From here Masters identified four major deviations from biblical standards in most modern worship.The first broken principle was that of aesthetic worship . Worship that focused on the physical trappings of art , drama , music , and performances denied the fact that true worship was worship that emanated from the spirit of man apart from any external means . Masters argued that today 's contemporary worship with its bands , orchestras , lighting , and dance has become a throwback to the Roman Catholic emphasis on the physical to please the Lord . Great performances and production do not make , and in fact , may actually destroy , true worship.The second broken principle was that of ecstatic worship . Worship that attempted to generate feelings at the expense of rationality denied the biblical principle of worshipping in truth . Modern worship tended to `` dumb down '' the songs , messages , and anything else that might cause a seriousness of thought on the part of the worshippers . Modern choruses were theologically shallow ( if not down right wrong ) and repetitive , and were used to generate an emotional state of satisfaction and happiness . Masters argued that emotions should be involved in worship , but only after the mind was engaged and made fully aware of the great truths found in Scripture.The third broken principle was that of profane worship . Worship that adopted the styles and elements of the world that were directly associated with and used to promote anti-Christian themes and rebellion was worship that was worldly and profane . Worship has always maintained a separation from that which was evil ; Christian worship was holy . Masters noted that the current trend arose out of two blending streams : [ 1 ] the Jesus People of California that refused to leave their `` hippie mysticism '' behind , and [ 2 ] worldly Christianity that wanted worship music to be like secular rock . These two were immediately adopted in Charismatic circles , which gave rise to almost all the new idioms of worship.The fourth broken principle was that of reverence . Reverence and godliness ought to characterize Christian worship and Masters argued that when this was lost , everything else went . He showed how a reverence in worship affected not only the believer 's demeanor at church , but also his dress , his behavior , his values , and even his personality.Masters debunked the myths that the great hymn writers such as Martin Luther borrowed from profane secular music . He spent time showing what kind of instrumentation was used for Old Testament worship and why dance , lifting of hands , and unrestrained percussion were not to be used . He focused on several worship passages in Scripture which gave rise to the traditions used for generations in Protestant churches . He evaluated the Charismatic argument of spontaneous worship and showed that God 's plan was that things were done decently and in order . He has some helpful charts that showed the similarity between the topics in traditional hymnals and the topics from the Psalms . He spent a great part of the book dealing with prayer in worship and gave a number of recommendations and biblical examples for public prayers.The book was refreshing in that it completely avoided discussions of musical genres . Rock , pop , country , jazz , blues -- who cared ? The issue was one of biblical principles and the consequent rejection of all that failed to live up to the Bible standard . This book should be a serious read for all who are concerned about worship . Many fundamental churches fall far short of the ideals articulated during the Reformation and reaffirmed here by Masters , even if they have not fallen prey to the Contemporary Christian Music ( CCM ) movement.While this reviewer did not necessarily agree with every specific conclusion put forth , Dr. Masters has presented a well articulated case against the modern worship trends . When one takes away the emotions involved in our worship and deals specifically with the biblical texts and arguments in this book , there will be little left to support the deviations Evangelicals -- and Fundamentalists -- have embraced over the last forty years .	1
`` Killing for Culture '' is a fascinating look at the subject of death in film and other media . Of particular note is the history behind the `` Snuff '' film , an urban legend that has persisted for years of movies where someone on-camera is murdered , for real . Of course , not one single frame of a snuff film has ever been uncovered , but that has n't stopped the legend from appearing , and re-appearing , over time.In addition to the sections on snuff , other areas of the death genre are explored , from the `` Mondo '' films of the 1960s , to the present-day `` Faces of Death '' style gore feasts . It makes for a fascinating , if gruesome , study of the various death genres of film and video .	1
Though familiar with David and his books , I had never read one . I thought it was going to be dry . Not so . The book is very pleasant to read and understand . Jacksons ' battle with Goring was very interesting and Speer 's turning surprised me as he never sounded like this in his book ( written in Spandau I believe ) . I recommend this to history buffs regardless of their revisionist or , lack thereof , leanings . Well documented and interesting expose ' on international and retroactive legal ideas !	1
I started reading the three books a second time . I consider them to be my bible .	1
I absolutely love this book . I 've read it twice through , and now I read chapters hear and there . It is incredibly faith building and a lot of fun to read besides . I ca n't recommend it highly enough . Wow ! Wow ! and Wow ! were my constant exclamations . I hope Dr. Cooper writes another book soon : )	1
I would have thought that a book written by an ex-SS member would have been full of justification for what the Nazi 's did in Europe . However this is more about combat experience and the hopelessness of the final fight in the last days of the Reich . Like soldiers everywhere it was about your mates rather than any political system One wonders if the full cost of the war was ever properly reconciled.A good read if you are interested in the Second World war , but I would avoid it if you are a bit squeamish . As a combat veteran I can understand many of the excesses and I have seen some pretty horrific sights especially when the perpetrators have been communists.Perhaps it should be standard reading at Dultroon .	1
Interesting ... To say the least ? The war thought the eyes of a third party ? Whom believed ... .in the cause ? Not tied to naziism as most would believe as much as against communism ? Interesting perspective . I am glad having read so many books from the victors ... To finally see both sides .	1
This book methodically and thoroughly delivers exactly what it promises . And this English-language book is a rare treasure , because there are very few books which cover this subject in English.Starting from the pinnacle of the entire German war machine with the Kaiser himself , the book details the command structure , unit responsibilities , and specific composition for the entire imperial German army . Following through its top-down progression it covers : the Supreme Army Command , the War Ministry , Supreme Commander East , the army groups , the armies , the general ( corps ) commands , and the divisions . The book also unravels numerous mysteries , such as the bewildering array of unit naming conventions , the creation and dissolution of temporary commands , the large array of unit types , the varying armament compositions between unit types , the growth of the air force , and all the administrative and logistical elements which are essential to any modern armies battlefield success . In addition , it presents several appendices which list : the complete German order-of-battle ( OOB ) for August 1914 , the 18th Army 's OOB for the March 1918 Kaiserschlacht Offensive , a summary list of brigade and mobile unit formations throughout the war , and a listing of all the army and higher level unit commanders throughout the war.The book tackles a very daunting subject and quite lucidly explains the inner workings of the German war machine . If you want to know how the German army was structured during the First World War , then this is the book for you . The book suffers from a few weaknesses ( but its valuable content overrides these ) . The most annoying thing about the book are the incorrect dates found throughout the first part of the book ( e.g . p. 79 `` During the 1918 offensive , General of Cavalry von der Marwitz was in command . The 2nd Army was dissolved on 13 January 1918 in Gembloux. '' ) . I actually sent an email to the publisher months ago about this but still have yet to receive a response . The other significant complaint I have is that the writing style is very dry and dull , but it is a reference work after all.In summary , I recommend you buy this book if you are doing scholarly research on the WWI German army . If you are looking for a narrative history or the complete German orders-of-battle for all the individual battles during the war , then look elsewhere . All in all , this is an outstanding and rare English-language reference work on the WWI German army .	1
Wonderful story combining historical facts with fictional events . The novel actual resonates with things going on in the world today . Great read when you 're traveling .	1
Dan Brown 's Da Vinci Code is one of my favorite books , and The Nostrdamus Secret is of a similar genre.The prologue starts the book out in a medieval secret chamber with the doom created by Nostradamus ' `` lost '' quatrains hanging over our heads . Then , the author takes us on an international political thrill ride to present day Washington , the Middle East , and the heartland of the U.S.where terrorists threaten our security.This book is not only a quick read and the characters written fully , but the story is pertinent to today 's political situation that we live everyday . I 've got several of my friends reading it . International intrigue , well-drawn out characters , Nostradamus quatrains , and a fast-paced read - it 's got it all .	1
This story held my attention but there moments where i could have used a better family tree . Great character development . Great sense of place . A few chapters were a little more drawn out than i would have liked . Overall a great historical fiction with a little literary license .	1
A well written science fiction work where the bleeding hearted liberals got their just deserts.I highly recommend this book that keeps you intertwined	1
I really enjoyed this book . I 'm more of a fantasy genre kind of guy , but this sci fi was right up my alley . It was pretty well written ( especially for being self published ) , the action flowed well , and the main characters were likable . The book was a fun readI also enjoyed the contrasts of the different cultures.A few suggestions I would give to the author:1 . I 've read other reviews that note how you stereotyped the black woman . The reality is that it is quite possible that there could be a black woman like that ( or a white woman , or asian man , etc ... ) . The problem is how you keep referring to her throughout the book as `` black '' . You might mention it once , then you should n't have to mention it again . Another strategy might not be to mention it at all and let the readers figure it out for themselves . Also ... let 's be real ... NO ONE admits that they only got somewhere because of affirmative action ... .you should just leave that part out ... 2 . The relationship between Harry and Kathleen is waaaaayyyy too shallow . They go from ( spoiler alert ! ) looking at each other a few times to doing it in the shower to being in love ... not much in between.The greatest part of this book , in my opinion , is the end . The author wrapped up the story ( while leaving an opening for further adventures ) rather than leaving you completely on a cliff . Although it is the first book in a trilogy , it stands by itself as a great story .	1
I enjoyed reading this book . The story unfolds quickly in unexpected ways . The science is not preposterous and the dialog was realistic . I thought the characters were poorly developed and flat , otherwise this could have been 5 stars . Most readers should like this book .	1
Fast moving and a little disconnected . The story telling is a little weak and the writer seems to feel that the reader can also dead his mind . But all in all not a bad book .	1
Metu Neter is a phenomenal book that has helped me a lot in my personal research and understanding . It covers a lot of ground such as history , biblical history and to my knowledge was the first spiritual book written from Afro-American viewpoint that discusses spirituality from a psychological perspective . It was through this book that I first became interested in psychology and understanding how it related to spirituality , because the author discuss in detail the various effects of the right and left hemispheres of the brain . As well as how these all relate to the conscious and unconscious parts of man and woman . The main focus of the book that is introduced is the Kamitic/Kemetic ( Ancient Africans of Egypt ) Tree of Life called the Paut Neteru.Unfortunately for me , the first time I read this book it was a little advance because I had not been exposed to the Paut Neteru or Tree of Life before , although I had come across teachings that were similar to it . This combined with a true lack of understanding about God and Self made it a little difficult to accept in the beginning but , the more I read it and referred to it . Eventually , in time it became a little bit easier to understand . When you finally read it and it begins to makes sense . It will serve as a great and invaluable reference guide that will help you to seriously think about what you are doing in your normal waking life , and how it pertains to your spiritual development . It is after that the various combinations called `` metu '' ( words in the Kamitic/Kemetic language ) , which correspond to the oracle system based upon the Paut Neteru begins to make sense as well .	1

Most readers will find that reading `` Wild Ink '' is like attending a workshop dedicated specifically to writers who write for young adults . For me , reading `` Wild Ink '' was almost like being at an author schmooze . Among the pages , I re-connected with several good writer friends and I even bumped into my agent . I ate my lunch with all of them.Amid the plethora of writing books in the world , this one stands out because of Victoria Hanley 's talent as both teacher and author . Do the exercises in Chapter 1 : Finding Your Writing Self , and you will know whether you really want to write for teens . Only then will you be able to face Chapter 3 's Obstacles and Demons . While Hanley presents a realistic picture of today 's publishing industry she is generous with advice , compassion , and humor.This book is not just for beginning writers because of all the interviews with writers , agents , and editors . While Hanley features such well-known authors as Chris Crutcher and Lauren Myracle , she also includes some `` not yet published '' in the YA genre authors , like Coleen DeGroff and Olgy Maria Aleu , plus interviews with self-published authors , like Becky Clark Cornwell . These writers ' stories give this book a feeling of `` we 're all in this together '' .As a professional for 30-plus years in the field of children 's literature , I am impressed with Hanley 's thoroughness , accuracy , and honesty . All writers whether beginners or experienced professionals , published or unpublished , will find themselves in good company . I wholeheartedly recommend this book .	1
Would that more sincere doubters and truthseekers would get their hands on works like this ! Dan has been on both sides of the fence -- believer and atheist , and therefore , can speak with a certain authority that few can claim to have . I read this as a defecting minister myself . I found much of the information helpful.The book is segmented as a compiled series of articles on varying topics . Dan begins by telling his story and then moves into dealing with different themes throughout the book . The book is not exhaustive and not extremely indepth , and is arguably a little too personal in its style of presenting facts , but still easily makes the cut as an excellent work that should be read by anyone looking to examine atheism vs. Christianity or freethought.

This book is full of female role models . Real movers & shakers . It should be required for children to study these women , and know what they did for the woman 's movement . I think too many young women take it all for granted and even tend to go backwards on women 's issues . It definitely is a must for all women to read.I only wish more information was included . I guess it would take a few volumes . Thank you Laurie Gaylor for writing .	1
Way back in the 70 's I became familiar with Robert Green Ingersoll - quite by accident* . My husband and I had a graphic arts business and one day a couple walked in with all the typeset pages for a smallish , limited edition ( college printed ) book of short excerpts from the works of RGI . It was our task to paste it up in folio form for printing ( something we always hated to do when our firm did not do the typesetting , in which case , if we had an accident we could print out a duplicate ) . It was not phototypesetting , but rather strike-on type from an IBM typesetting machine - smear-able among other problems . Boy , did it take a long time for me to paste-up that copy - since I found myself reading more than pasting . There was no internet then , so my husband and I went to a used bookstore and put out a search for the set of Ingersoll 's complete works . We lucked into 2 sets of the first printing , one in excellent condition and one in a little less good condition . They are treasured possessions.After reading that set of RGI complete works , we still had many questions about what factors in a person 's life could lead someone to so radically turn away from the `` norm '' of beliefs for his time and then to speak of those beliefs with such vehemence and openness . The biographical information with the set of his works was helpful , but we still had unanswered questions . This book , American Infidel helped us to fill in many of those blanks . It is well researched . This book takes you on a `` cradle to grave '' trip though RGI 's life . It is very fascinating , especially so if you are familiar with RGI 's works , to learn what was happening in his life and in the United States when he formulated his speeches that eventually were printed in the 12 volume set . This book also takes you on a trip through American politics after the Civil War . As an adult , RGI was `` from Illinois '' ( eventually moving to Washington D.C. ) , and since I grew up in Illinois it was especially interesting for me to read of all the `` wheeling and dealing '' there was in politics then . The more things change the more they stay the same ! I highly recommend this book to all lovers of Ingersoll . Even more so , I highly recommend it to persons who are not familiar with Ingersoll . Even if you do not agree with some of his beliefs , it is impossible to not see how dead on he was about the equality of all persons - regardless of race or gender . In many ways he was far ahead of his time . I believe that , if you know nothing of Ingersoll , and read this book , you 'll be hungry for more than the small excerpts of his works that are quoted in the book . You are fortunate - in the 70 's there were no reprints of his complete works as there are now - available in both printed and electronic copies . Sadly , none of us will be able to hear his rich voice delivering his thoughts and there seem to be no photos of him until he was well into adulthood . ( My copy of this book is the original 1962 printing - I hope more photos are in the newer printing . ) *Throughout my schooling , whenever a mention was made of a great 19th century orator , the only name I heard was Lincoln . I find it very sad that , because of Ingersoll 's beliefs , his existence was effectively expunged from history for so long .	1
I came across Martha Alderson about five years ago in a Writers Digest article . Immediately after reading the article I purchased the book . I devoured it . Finally somebody who not only got it , but could teach and explain it to others . Priceless.Before Martha 's book , I had read a variety of plot books ( Anson Dibell , Sawyer & Weingarten , etc.. ) many of which left me more confused afterwards then when I started . Her book was unique and provided a system that was simple to employ in order to achieve results.Currently , I 'm working on my first fiction novel . I called on Martha 's expertise to evaluate my project and the direction I was headed . During my two hour consult she was able to effectively evaluate my work , provide keen insight , as well as alternate avenues of approach to the telling of my story.I was truly pleased with the experience . If you are considering writing a novel you would be wise to consult Martha during the planning/outlining stage before committing ink to paper . This alone will result in a tighter story with more universal appeal.Martha is truly good at what she does.Matt Leatherwood , Jr.Author , Train To Baghdad [ ... ]	1
I am American and have a degree from a German university in translation and lived in Germany for over 8 years . I have to say that this book is simply brilliant and really explains what makes the Germans tick . I can not recommend this book highly enough .	1
What I wanted : I am moving to Germany this month and thought I should pick up a book to help understand the cultural gap between Americans and Germans.What I got : Exactly what I was looking for . The book covers the the German identity from the Roman times till about 2001 . Topics cover everything from Germans struggle to come to terms with WWII , business , personal life , and its changing socio-economic developments . I have lived in Italy for a couple years and made friends with several Germans . This book helped me understand a lot about my German friends that I did n't realize before . It helped me understand that although Germans and Americans are similar in many things , they are still very distant.I think this is a good read for anyone spending a significant amount of time in Germany . It will paint a pretty good picture of what the German culture is like.I felt that the book towards the end became very repetitive . I am not sure if there is an updated edition that brings it through 2011 , but overall I think this book will be invaluable to my integration .	1
At first glance Harding 's & quot ; headless & quot ; approach looks more like a gimmic than a spiritual exercise . Pretending that one has no head seems like something for children to do . Harding 's methods help one break through the subject/object duality of experience . All experience begins with the & quot ; I & quot ; thought . With Harding 's headless method the & quot ; I & quot ; is no longer idenfied with it 's customary location in the head but with what one experiences.I admit I had a hard time with some of his language as there seems to be a slight communication gap ( for me anyway ) between British and American english . It was n't until I actually has a headless experience that I saw the profundity of his work . With so many spiritual texts sounding like the other this is truly a unique work and perspective .	1
Douglas Harding 's On Having No Head : Zen And The Rediscovery Of The Obvious is a philosophical look at & quot ; headlessness & quot ; , or the psychological state of & quot ; no-self & quot ; of mysticism that opens one 's mind and senses to the workings of internal and external nature . Harding places & quot ; the headless way & quot ; within a Zen context , as well as comparing it to other spiritual traditions in this insightful and thought-provoking treatise . On Having No Head is a highly recommended contribution to Buddhist and Eastern Philosophy supplemental reading lists .	1
This guy seems nuts on the first read , but the second read , if read seriously is full of wisdom.A very unique , and well founded point of view .	1
God has n't asked us to set aside our intelligence to serve Him and have faith in Him . All it takes is opening our eyes to the intricate details of the world around us that work perfectly together in harmony to maintain life as we know it , to realize that there is a designer behind this design . This book will not help you to convince someone who refuses to take an open look at the evidence around them . It is absolutely wonderful , though , to show to someone who has honest doubts , but is searching for the truth- what ever that truth may be . God has given us plenty of evidence of His existence and the legitimacy of His word . If that 's what you 're wanting to learn more about , then this book is for you . From a scientific standpoint , it is to the point , deep but totally understandable . If you 're intimidated by science , do n't be intimidated to get this book ... the author does a great job at staying to the point and making it plain to the average person .	1
Beautifully illustrated oversize book with tons of fact filled information and Pictures on the World 's Greatist Healing Plant.Makes a great Gift for anyone.This book breaks apart The lies and Disinformation disseminated about Hemp and shows that it can greatly benefit Mankind.Highly Recommended it should be in everybody 's library ! !	1
I have avoided Solara 's writings for 20 years . And today I am magnetized by this book and have read it voraciously , absorbing every word . The book describes Solara 's direct experience with her angelic Self and the teachings of that Self for all humanity . The teachings include : the descent of angels into experience with matter and how human bodies were developed as their vehicles , how we angels can transmute our physical selves into a higher vibration , and how by ascending in consciousness we regain our Oneness with all Creation . I find Solara 's information , 20 years later , in perfect accord with what I need to be focusing on right now in my life , and I am grateful to have discovered this book .	1
This is probably the most informative lay book one can get for fish ID . Some of the material is a little dated . The binding and cover are done very well for a paperback . The only downside is the weight of the book . It 's a little too heavy to drag on trips .	1
Reviewed for web site : - whats that fish . Wonderful book , full of pictures and information , a must have for any diver !	1
I am an avid reader and if I never read another book , I am satisfied . I am in love with the way this book is written and I feel years of glorious learning ahead from only what I have read here .	1
I love Deepak Chopra 's messages . This book was very easy to read and I was finished rather quickly . It 's the kind of book you can read again and again to put into practice his common sense strategies for living a successful life . While the book is spiritual , it 's actually very realistic and practical just as the title eludes . Highly recommend for anyone looking to improve their situation or live a happier life .	1
Nice synopsis of true spiritual living . Helpful , clearlywritten . Highly recommend for those seeking meaning and purpose in life . Worthwhile !	1
Deepak Chopra 's The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success is a super way to compliment your self-help library . Even though I am not one to usually jump on the spiritual bandwagon , reading this book and listening to the tape helped me understand the laws of the universe better , and how important they are to adhere to . From what Mr. Chopra is teaching , it seems that the universe is guided by benevolent forces , and if we follow them , then we 're likely to succeed and be happy and fulfilled . I highly recommend this book and/or tape .	1
This book shows Jane Roberts at her best and nicely illustrates Seth philosophy in & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; ! This book shows Jane Roberts at her best and nicely illustrates Seth philosophy in & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; !	1
Every time I read one of the Seth books , my soul is nourished and enlightened . I am so very glad I discovered them . Thank you Seth !	1
I 've been fascinated with the Seth Phenomenon for awhile , and I knew that Jane Roberts had died fairly young of what appears to be systemic autoimmune disease . I 'm really glad her husband decided to publish this , it must have been very painful for such private people to write about their last , very difficult , years together . There 's a lot of honesty in the book , and genuine confusion for this couple over the obvious clash between Seth 's messages of optimism , healing , and encouragement , and Jane 's slow decline and eventual death . There 's a lot to think about here ... .I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it 's really a book for people who 've already read ( probably several times ) the Seth Canon . It 's really more of a coda .	1
I enjoyed this book immensely . I stumbled on it by sheer accident and it 's changed my life ! This book is so amazing , that i 've recommended it personally to others and even bought one for a friend for her birthday . i 've even read it aloud to girls who i 've dated because i felt its message was so powerful and i wanted to share it.At a Toastmasters club where i 'm a member , i delivered a speech on personal development and incorporated some of the principles in this book as well as another book i feel strongly about : Working on Yourself Does n't Work , by Ariel and Shya Kane . ( That book has 3 principles/axioms of Transformation that can not be proved but are experiential in nature . i.e. , you will feel in your heart and soul that they are true because you 've experienced them ) . I rendered that speech so powerfully because it came from the heart and people afterwards were truly inspired and asked me for more references , which is when i recommended them to The Mastery of Love & Working on Yourself Does n't Work . ( Also , the Kanes ' book on How to Create a Magical Relationship is awesome as well )	1
I loved this book and CD . It deals with how we deal with all realtionships in life . The book was great and the CD is nice to be able to down load or listen in my car especially when people are so crazy to keep me in check . It should be mandatory reading or listenting for all human beings . Also check out his other works .	1
`` Love your neighbor as yourself . '' Jesus . Miguel unveils the `` how to '' behind this famous quote in The Mastery of Love . He is masterful in his ability to make profound truths , concerning others , simple and easy to apply . This is the kind of book that you can open to any page and instantly walk away with wisdom that evokes a deeper connection to the experience of loving and being loved ... Is'nt that why we are here ? As I read through this book I get the feeling : `` Oh yea I remember , I was created in these truths , these ways of loving a long time ago and I simply forgot because of false beliefs and pain in my life that I have allowed to define me . '' Thank you , Miguel , for reminding me of the simple ways of loving I knew well as a child.Author Lauren E Miller [ ... ]	1
I loved this book so much that I read it twice , something I do n't usually do . Lots of food for thought and very practical . The author writes from his heart and directly to the heart of the reader . I am so glad I purchased this book as it has helped me immensely .	1
This book really goes into depth with the four agreements which , while very simple , are so deep that I found I needed more guidance . I am working through this book as it has a lot of suggestions for taking you deeper into unraveling your own deceptions , programming or beliefs that you need to let go of . Ruiz suggests questions you can ask yourself to take you to a deeper level .	1
Great Insight to the inner voice that we use to judge ourselves in negative ways . I enjoyed it but feel the four agreements is the better book between the two if your trying to decide . If you 've already read the Four agreements , then it 's definitely worth the read . I do not feel that this book repeats a lot of `` old hat '' topics , I just think he is covering them lightly in the event the reader has not read the other books and or is just recovering old ground for the sake of repetition ( how many times have you gone over the same thing trying to learn something and what better way to lean something then to repeat it ) . I only mention this as Ive seen other reviews bash some of his books for back tracking . I personally have never been bothered by it and feel it 's like retracing your steps and noticing new things you may not have thought before .	1
I am a long time fan of Don Miguel . The Four Agreements are life altering . This goes further to explain how you can change your mind and change your life .	1
Love Love Love . My hair stylist told me about the 4 agreements so when I saw it was a set I went for it . Worth the money for sure	1
I just started to read this and it is a great reminder on how to direct ones life.Based off of the orginal book `` The Four Agreements '' which I enjoyed and has been a great guide.This is a great outline on how to live ones life.A MUST read !	1
Looking for a bit of inspiration ? Open the book to what ever page you like and see if you are not so inspired ...	1
I had the honor to have both Don Miguel Ruiz and his son Don Jose Ruis on my LifeBites radio show last month . In their book , The `` Fifth Agreement , '' both do a great job in talking to people about discerning the truth . So much of what we are taught from the time we are small to adulthood is programmed into us ; we become like robots just executing what we have been taught to believe is the truth . Their work is much needed on the planet today . `` The Fifth Agreement '' is a great book for those of you who have read the popular `` Four Agreements . '' It expands the lessons and allows us all to go a little deeper ! [ ... ]	1
The concepts in the Seven Laws are concepts I can relate to and put in practice . My take away is the the laws of success is faith , faith in vision for your life as designed by the Creator and walking out the vision trusting that everything is orchestrate for you as you serve humanity and the Most High God .	1
The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success : A Pocketbook Guide to Fulfilling Your Dreams by Deepak Chopra is a book based on a ah ha moment in which he states `` We are spiritual beings having a human experience . '' Chopra tries to explain the natural laws of giving , desire and detachment among others and apply these natural principles into a satisfying life .	1

But it is a challege to first understand the laws but to practice them will eventually get you to your prize.Healing the Rift : Merging Science and Spirituality	1
Deepak is one of my favorite authors . I would marry this man . I love his works and I never get tired of them . I am not so thrilled of the idea that he teamed up with Oprah to do meditation CDs . Deepak had his own thing and I think he should have kept it that way ...	1
I love Deepak Chopra 's books and this one is amazing . It really remind us of Who we really are : a divine light , filled with power , totally free and immersed in Grace.As a student of Transpersonal Psychology , this book is very helpful for my course and my practice , as a therapist.I recommend it to anyone interested in the eternal big questions of life !	1
`` The Milepost '' is a uniquely invaluable resource for travel by road in Alaska and Northwest Canada . In a land with few roads and fewer services , this guide can be very useful to the average tourist , RVer , and camper.Alaska and Northwest Canada are a huge area with some significant terrain and far less travel infrastructure than most travelers are used to finding in southern Canada or in the lower 48 states . Travelers should not expect gas stations , restaurants , and franchise hotels at every exit of the highway , nor should they expect that facilities will be open year-round . Just to make it interesting , some routes are closed in winter or become highly dangerous due to snow and ice . Travelers should be alert to meeting wildlife on the road , or getting stuck behind a herd of bison at Muncho Lake in Canada.The Milepost provides maps , diagrams , photographs , and a mile by mile commentary for the major highways in Alaska and Canada . The information will allow the traveler to find the next open gas station , campground , or scenic spot , along with interesting places to eat . The advertisements allow visitors to phone or email ahead to make sure of a bed for the night . Travelers can also plan ahead for fishing charters or the operating hours of some unique museums and other roadside attractions . The most recent edition of the Milepost will have the latest updates on road conditions and bypasses.The Milepost is a must-have guide to the North Country ; very highly recommended .	1
An interlinear will not analyze every single word for you . What it will do , is to give you an quick translation of the particular word that might be giving you trouble . If you want more analysis of particular words , BAGD , Louw & amp ; Nida , and of course Kittle gives you good help there.That said , Green 's interlinear is invaluable for the Bible student . Unlike some interlinears , the entire text of the Bible is contained and translated in one volume . The & quot ; literal translation & quot ; in the margin is also helpful.Sometimes the KJV English is a little dated ( & quot ; peradventure & quot ; is not a word I use a whole lot ) , but again , this book is designed to give you a quick , one-word translation of the Hebrew or Greek word in question . This book will get you started , but you should be looking for additional help as well .	1
Debbie Lee Wesselmann has created one of the most original storylines I have read in a long time . And if the plot does n't immediately capture your interest , her magical characters will . They are irresistible.Michelle Trutor left Boston in a hurry . She is finally fleeing an abusive relationship , leaving her possessions and past behind and temporarily moving to Derbysville , NH . Arthur Wharton , a dear friend she met in an evening philosophy class , taught by her ex , has invited her to stay with him and his family for a while . Trutor nicknamed the old man & quot ; the Balloonist & quot ; because his eccentric dress evoked humorous images of him piloting a balloon , and soaring over the New England countryside . His Victorian home in Derbysville , thought to be haunted by many , is inhabited by Arthur , his twin Proctor , and their bizarre niece Roberta . Caroline , Arthur 's and Proctor 's adopted sister , left the house to the twins and Roberta , to remain in their possession only if they adhere to some pretty unconventional conditions . The Balloonist asks Trutor to open the locked door to Caroline 's past and write the biography of the many faceted and very talented woman who raised the brothers and their niece . The quest to discover who Caroline was is an enchanting adventure , filled with delightful riddles and much mystery.Underlying the novel 's light tone is the dark menace of domestic abuse . Most of the people in the novel have been victims and their fear , which surfaces from time to time , and the impact the abuse has wrought in their characters permeate the story . A particular passage struck me as summarizing the justification behind the hurt Caroline has inflicted on so many . It is from her diary . Burdened at too young an age with tremendous responsibility for which her years could never have prepared her , she writes : & quot ; Today , I have discovered that one is not remembered long for love . Hatred , pure evil deeds , are forever . One can so injure an individual that he is from that moment changed , and he in turn passes these seeds of malice to everyone he meets . After all of my helplessness , I finally wield power. & quot ; Ms. Wesselmann 's prose is lyrical , her characters complex , endearing , and often outrageous , the dialogue engaging . The mix of light and dark throughout this well crafted novel keeps the reader on edge . Once I began this very unusual book I could not put it down . Highly recommended ! JANA	1
Let me state first of all that this novel was a good read - I would n't put it in the same class as some other Irish writers I admire ( such as William Trevor and Sebastian Barry ) , but Keady seems to have a knack for a good , interesting story , peopled with an array of ( mostly ) likeable , idiosyncratic characters . The questions that naturally arise from the storyline - a nun leaving her convent and giving up her vows to take over the farm left to her by her recently-deceased father , then intentionally getting pregnant out of wedlock , with no intention of getting married - are important and valid ones . Set in 1950 , in rural Ireland , one does n't have to imagine very far to understand that the Church frowned mightily at such goings-on - and even within the Church itself , the reactions to Mary McGreevy 's 'scandalous ' behavior vary a great deal . Some of the Clergy are sympathetic and understanding - some are livid and vindictive.The character of Mary herself is an admirable one - many years ahead of her time , so to speak . She 's a strong-willed , intelligent woman , bound and determined to do everything her own way . She 's also possessed of a kind heart - and those of her neighbors who can see past her non-traditional path to motherhood recognize her as a good person , and do their best to be her friend . Again , given the time and place , that 's not always easy to do.Keady draws the characters well , but after a while , their 'Irishness ' seems to be laid on a little thick - and the story , as heartwarming and thought-provoking as it is , tends to run in a rut as predictable as you might find in a rural Irish lane . Maybe I just 'got lucky ' , but I saw the revelation at the end coming a mile away . These are admittedly relatively minor complaints - and they certainly wo n't keep me from recommending this novel . Try it - I 'll wager you 'll find yourself smiling a good bit of the while ...	1
Probably the single best Christmas book I have ever read . Fantastic story and terrific artwork . A lot of imagination went into explaining the various facets and history of Christmas . I have to buy a used copy since I gave away the other two I bought to friends and relatives .	1
The prologue to this book put me off a little , containing as it did a very descriptive act of violence , but I persevered since someone had recommended this book to me . Two more very ugly , explicit and disgusting sexualized `` scenes '' in the very early pages had me deleting the whole thing and not reading any further . I 'm told this has been made into a movie , which not only beggars belief , but illustrates why I rarely find a movie these days that is worth watching .	-1
Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane ; I will always view it differently ! The 90 year old man telling the story reacted the same way I would have ... stomach distress . Should be rated R for sexual and other graphic language . I do not reccommend it for sensitive , caring women .	-1
I never found a book that so accurately portrayed growing old and how you are treated . The story begins with life in the circus ,	-1
Dreadful . Judging from the first paragraph , this novel had the potential for being absorbing and a good holiday read . I was soon only making my way through it because I had nothing else to read and I kept thinking it must get better since it came highly recommended . If only I had had something better than this time waster : lazy plot that never seemed to go anywhere because it went in too many irrelevant directions , little firsthand knowledge of the circus , low-level vocabulary . A waste of time on a good topic .	-1
I did n't like it -- too depressing -- killings , , blood , war -- who needs it , even if t was Hemmingway . The main character in the book , Robert , may have been a self study of Hemmingway himself ! !	-1
I 'll make this as short as possible ... ... ... ..like I wish the book would have been . This read was easily twice as long as it needed to be . I got halfway through , and quit . It was so boring . I wanted , ( as always ) , a good story , not a tedious dialog that goes on and on about every little detail involved in colonizing a planet . I ca n't believe this author is receiving accolades for this work . He can , in no way , be compared to any of the greats in the sci-fi field .	-1
Red Mars started off just dandy , with a variety of characters ( a bit too one-dimensional , but hey ) struggling with how to best colonize Mars . No one was a 'good ' guy or a 'bad ' guy - just good hard sci-fi mixed with honest ideological differences.Halfway through the book , however , it all changed . All of a sudden , Trans-national corporations are launching nukes , after buying out the United Nations . Christian fundamentalists try to dominate the colonies . A few hundred scientists on Mars discover wildly optimistic technologies , while the billions of people on Earth decend into chaos , primarily because of those darn evil trans-nationals.What started out as a balanced and interesting book jumped clear off the left end . I 'll only read the sequels because I want to read all the Hugo and Nebula award winners - not because I have any hope for the rest of the series .	-1
This is not one of his best , but considering what manure or tree wasters he has written , this is almost good . I have stopped reading this author , he seems to get paid by the word and in later books puts in subplots that have nothing to do with the book so he can make political or religious statements.Buy this book second hand , and keep it handy for a camping trip . It will give you something to read on rainy days and will give you a nice supply of toilet paper .	-1
This is a fantasy book for teens . Yep ! There really are evil monsters that follow the biddings of satanic witches . Our trucker hero , Josh , is caught up in a small , isolated Virginia town 's nightmare when he accidentally runs over a newborn in a stroller.When he refuses to recant his story that an evil woman pushed the stroller purposefully into the truck 's path , the bad guys have got to silence him.This was written in an average writing style with silly , unbelievable characters . Gray , I 'm sure , will have lots of followers -- those who like books about witches , dragons , zombies , and anything else teenager-ish . Please do n't waste your time with this !	-1
Language and imagery continue to get more illicit.The only characters that I still liked in the series keep getting killed .	-1
In my opinion , the writing of DwD almost seemed to say , `` These people will take whatever crumbs I toss at them and love it ; I am GRRM ! '' To which *I* say , `` Look , you ingrate , for YEARS I practically shoved your dang books down the throats of friends , family , and complete strangers . I defended you whenever anyone complained about the ridiculous length of time between books . I lauded your Seven Kingdoms in all the different kingdoms to which we traveled . I started a SoIaF group , that we might discuss this series that we loved . I spent oodles of cash on your books for myself and as gifts for others . I supported your website and listened to your interviews . I convinced people who could n't stand the fantasy genre to read your words . I did all of this , and THIS is how you repay me ? By writing a book from which you seemed too far away ? By worshiping at the altar of HBO , as your books took a back burner to the series ? By complaining that we who do n't LOVE every word written by your royal hand are sock puppets ? By making it seem like your own importance now outweighs the love of your earliest fans ? '' Remember us ? We are your earliest fans ... the people who read your first book , then your second , etc , and it is we who ultimately helped you to this throne on which you currently sit.Like many other reviewers , I have read the first four books of the ASoIaF series many times over ( starting in the late '90 's ) as I waited for the next book to come out , then the next book , etc . I happily reread those first three books ( again ! ) as I awaited FfC , re-living each profound event of the series as if I were discovering it for the first time , which speaks to the phenomenal writing of those First Three.When FfC was finally published , I was there first thing in the morning , waiting impatiently to grab the goods , rush home , and then to devour the book with glee ! Then , when I was finished reading ... It was okay ... But that was acceptable to me ; the next book was BOUND to be better . It was BOUND to recapture the magic and continue the legacy that GRRM had created . So , as MORE YEARS went by , I waited impatiently yet again , checking his web page for updates like a maniac , asking everyone at my local bookstore if they 'd heard anything yet , participating in online forums to help pass the time . Until , finally , finally , DwD was released . Once again I was first in line to get the next book of my beloved series . I carted it home and immediately began to read.Two months later I was finished . To be clear : I am a very fast reader , depending on how much I 'm enjoying the book that I 'm holding . In other words , I was so disappointed in DwD that it was almost painful to force myself to finish reading it . I barely recognized many of the characters that I loved , and I kept waiting for the story to progress enough to recapture my attention , but it was as though GRRM was writing from a far off tower constructed from his overabundance of hubris . I promised myself that I would only write my review after reading it a second time , but my bookmark sits idle somewhere around page 400 . I just ca n't finish it this time.So , sadly , I not only ca n't recommend A Dance with Dragons , I also can no longer defend my once-favorite author . I can only hope that he hears us , and goes on a legitimate quest for the magic of the First Three .	-1
After making it to the end of book 5 , I refuse to waste another dollar or minute of my time on this meandering miasma of meaninglessness.Book 1 was of course a pretty good read . By books 2 and 3 , I started reading just one sentence per page in some chapters to get through the endless and excessive descriptions . By books 4 and 5 , in many chapters I was reading perhaps one sentence every five or ten pages because the story literally moves that slowly.I really do n't know what GRRM hoped to accomplish with the awful books 4 and 5 . As countless other reviewers have pointed out , despite their 1,700 pages of text , pretty much nothing happens except that a character or two that might have been developed in some meaningful way was killed off.There is so much that could have been done but was n't . Sansa and Tyrion could actually have learned something from each other , and their marriage might have developed with a little time . Arya was on a roll for the first three books then hit the tar pits of books 4 and 5 . And Jon ... what a waste.My biggest gripe is GRRM 's proclivity for doing lengthy character developments , then abruptly killing the character . I found almost as bad his undeviating use of cliffhanger chapter endings . Obviously , it is a pretty standard practice in popular entertainment novels , but he manages to make the trite device excruciatingly painful time after time by waiting five or ten chapters , or even an entire book , to again pick up the story for that character.In short , GRRM has squandered in countless ways what could have been an exciting three or four books . Instead , he supersized it , filled it with bloat , and destroyed nearly all forward momentum with hundreds and hundreds of pages of meaningless writing.So I 'm done . I refuse to read any more .	-1
No need for the 12 paragraph reviews I 've been reading . The review is simple : After the third book this guy just ran out of gas but was making so much dough he kept going . Sort of . But not very well .	-1
Very disappointing . A huge let down from previous books in the series . Not sure I will buy the next book ... .	-1
I wo n't go into detail since many others have done a far better job than I can . I 'm only about 1/3 through this book so far . I was very disappointed in Feast for Crows and this book will join that one in the disappointment category . Storm of Swords was sooooo good ! I did n't expect the 4th and 5th books in the series to be as good , especially since I had read the reviews , but my gosh . I 'd say it 's a fast read because you can skip a lot except in places it 's so boring that I tend to fall asleep ( I only have time to read at night ) . I wanted to read Dance with Dragons right away since I have been reading the entire series this year after getting hooked on the HBO show . All I can say is , I hope Winds of Winter is better and does n't take Mr. Martin 5 years to publish because in 5 years , not only will I have forgotten everything I 've read , but I may not care . I guess if you 're a fan of the Song of Fire and Ice as I am , this is a must read , as I considered it , but be prepared to slog through it and be prepared for the characters to act differently than they did in Storm of Swords . 'Nuff said .	-1
I loved the first three books of the series but the fourth seemed half a book and went nowhere ( not surprisingly since Martin claimed that it was half of a book and the other half would be out in no time ) . After five years we get this absolutely worthless excuse for a book . Chapter after chapter introduces one or two characters , moves the plot forward infinitesimally and then skips onto the next . Half way through I realised that even if I finished the book there would still be TWO MORE to come ( by 2023 given his present pace ) . I think that he has written himself into a corner , he has no idea of how the plot will end , if it ever will .	-1
I was really looking forward to this book , wow was I disappointed . Absolutely nothing was accomplished and the story remained stalled . At this pace the rest of the story will fill another 5 books ... ..at least .	-1
I was an avid fan of the first 3 George R R Martin books in this series and I anxiously awaited this last one to come out , especially since it took around 6 years to write . I was horribly disappointed by this book and I honestly could not finish it.The sad truth is is that this book could have been about 300 pages and still accomplished the amount of story told in this book . Nothing actually happens . Although a large amount of time passes in this book it seems like none of the main characters actually get anywhere or accomplish anything . In fact , most of the book is about people just sitting around and talking , their is a chapter were a character is sitting in a room talking and only 1 sentence said in the course of 15 pages is relevant and actually forwards the plot any at all . At times I would start a chapter and wonder if I should just skim it because I wondered if it would be relevant or another character simply walking around and talking about his or her day . Their is also very little action in this book , maybe 1 fight that lasts half a chapter , which also hurts this book tremendously as the previous once were a non stop thrill ride.I wanted to like this book , I truly did . The fact that nothing happens and that I do n't feel like I have enriched myself or the story ANY makes me realize what a tremendous waste of time it was to read this book . I pray that his last 2 books liven up the story , I would hate to have this book end on such a horrendous note .	-1
I 'm not investing anymore time or money in this series . 5 years between books and the author coughs up this Hairball . George needs to get over himself .	-1
I wish I could say it took me two weeks to finish this book because I was savoring it . After all I had been so excited that I pre-ordered this book the first day I could . Heck , I almost ordered it via the UK Amazon just so I could get it sooner , but after the bad taste `` A Feast ... '' left in my mouth I was n't quite willing to shell out the big bucks that would have required.I was giddy with anticipation , and having been reminded how good the series is by HBO , I felt like a kid at Christmas when the UPS man dropped off my copy of `` A Dance ... '' Two weeks and a thousand pages later , George RR Martin has lost me as a reader . Never mind the five years , the nine other books he published or edited between `` A Feast ... '' and `` A Dance ... '' , or the slow paced unsatisfying novel that `` A Feast ... '' was . It would have been worth it had this book delivered . I would have gladly gone back to being the GRRM fanboy I was , preaching the wonders that is his Song of Ice and Fire , but no . I can't.Much has already been said about how long the book is . Its long and you feel every page . The words crawl by , the plot and stories advance sluggishly at best , and new characters are introduced to replace characters that have been killed off , brought back , and killed off again . The existing characters , exist only as a backdrop to the history and turtles that GRRM wants to talk about . Only rather than telling those stories , through characters , plot lines , and differing points of view , he reduces characters , such as Tyrion , to disinterested third party narrators.Gone is the suspense , missing is the magic , and lost is the laser like focus of the first three books . It should say a lot that the most interesting plots in `` A Dance ... '' seem almost tacked on , after thoughts to the story GRRM wanted to tell . Though rougher , and less polished than the main storylines in the novel , these `` other '' stories show flashes of brilliance and a return to storytelling that made GRRM great in the first place . Sadly though , these stories are few and separated by hundreds of pages , and dozens of chapters about nothing.More tragically its seems that GRRM has found his `` Wesley Crusher '' , something he had managed to avoid doing ( or at least managed to avoid being eye stabbingly obvious ) about in his prior books . This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me , authors need to keep themselves and their Mary Sue 's out of their books.One last note and only because I have n't seen it mentioned in the other reviews . GRRM interjected quite a bit of his personal views and politics in both `` A Feast ... '' and `` A Dance ... '' . There is nothing wrong with this as such , most authors do this , without even realizing it . They project their world view upon a fictional world of their own making and its impossible for it not to happen . `` A Dance ... '' very much became a heavy handed and preachy vehicle for his politics .	-1
I hate these books as much as I love them . They go on and on and say nothing An interesting , well loved character to me equals great reading , a character I do n't like means pushing my way through many tedious pages of boredom . Martin is an OK writer but if he was a good writer the books could be half as long and say much more . I do n't understand why people think these books are great as they are simply tedious and at times very boring . Do n't waste your time trying to read this sluggish mess of words	-1
A long wait and so disappointing . The book was wordy and overly descriptive . How much detail do we really need when a person is eating ... I do n't really care about what the people are eating , I want a progressive plot . Unless the food is somehow moving the plot along , I just do n't care . This goes as well for the lengthy deep thinking done by many of the characters , which actually come out as a lot of woe is me . The book could have been cut by 400 words . I found myself drifting off a lot , or skimming quickly through pages to get back to the plot . Some of the characters , such as Davos , were so boring that I almost skipped their chapters . The past books have been so good , this left me numb .	-1
Ok , so I have now read all five of the `` Ice and Fire '' series and can say that I will not be picking up the sixth when/if it ever comes out . The first three books are some of my favorite titles of all time . A Clash of Kings is just all around a great story with great character . And the next was good , but you could tell it was beginning to fall off . And then you get to A Feast for Crows where the whole series falls apart . You read about a bunch of character you do n't care about and wonder `` Where the hell is Jon and Tyrion ! '' Well you finally get them back in this book , but you will be very disappointed with these characters . The book in whole just never catches steam . You read about people walking , and thinking about doing something , and sitting in rooms with each other talking about doing something and then by the end , none of it happens.I know no review will make someone who has read all the books stop them from reading this one I read a ton saying do not read this and look at me ) but i figured I 'd spare you the 15 bucks and tell you you are not missing anything .	-1
I 've always been a huge Agatha Christie fan , but this book is a complete departure from her usual work and I hate to say it , but it falls short . I always finish reading a book if I start it , but there were times when I was really tempted to just put this one down . If you 're looking for classic Christie , this is probably not the book for you . I found the beginning quite good , but ended up plodding through the rest of it .	-1
Ever hear the phrase `` suspension of disbelief '' ? You 'll need a truckload of it for this book . The story is entertaining enough ; I can see why it was made into a movie . But you 'll need to turn off the logical part of your brain as the invincible , superhuman Dirk Pitt achieves one utterly implausible escape after another.Cussler finally lost me when Dirk and his pal , after wandering in the Sahara Desert for days with no food or water , discover a crashed airplane and manage to rebuild it into a `` land yacht . '' They ride it to safety and are restored to perfect health in moments after guzzling some water . Oh , please ... This was my first Clive Cussler novel , and I suspect it will be my last .	-1
Here we have another highly-rated book which I could not finish.As others noted , it begins very strong . But it never progresses nor develops into a story which becomes involving . The characters are uni-dimensional . They generate neither sympathy nor joy and they are stuck in a storytelling style which is framed in the act of `` recounting '' a multi-year adventure where the same things keep happening : The Vikings go ashore in strange places to pillage . They then high-tail it on the sea before they are caught . Sometimes they escape , sometimes they are captured and enslaved . Rinse , repeat.Drama , complications , character development : Nonexistent . Humor : Rare , regardless of what the other reviews promise . Nevertheless , it 's the non-dynamic style which truly kills it.I usually give up on boring books if they do n't become very promising by the 25 % mark . I stuck with this one until I 'd finished 30 % because it was unusual and intermittently interesting at the beginning . But there are too many good books to discover rather than stick with something tediously written , delivering diminishing returns.While thick , it is a very shallow book which might make a good adventure movie for kids or the extremely undemanding .	-1
I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book , so it pains me to be so negative , but her age really does show . The story is n't interesting , the mystery is n't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self . The exception is Ariadne Oliver , who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character . This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery , and she gets an excellent send-off . The same can not be said for Poirot . This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote , though not the final one that was published , since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death . I have n't read it yet because I can not bear to , so I 'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read . I just hope it 's superior to this one ! In this one , Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver 's god children . They were found shot to death in the woods , but what happened ? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa ? Was it a suicide pact ? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon , then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she has n't seen in many years , to ask questions about what was happening in the family , to try and put the pieces together with Poirot , who is busy talking to the police . It 's quite similar toFive Little Pigs ( Also published as Murder In Retrospect ) , another Poirot murder in retrospect . The difference is that you 'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off , as I was . I can now say that about only three of her books ( Peril at End House : A Hercule Poirot Mystery ( Agatha Christie Collection ) andThe Mirror Crack 'd ( Miss Marple Mysteries ) being the other two ) and sadly , it does n't make for a very interesting read . More annoying still is that in this book , a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery , he should find and interview person X , because she might be able to help them with the truth . And so after pages and pages of wasted time , Poirot finds and interviews X , and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY . She is flown to England , she tells her story and then the mystery is solved . So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed ? ! That guy could 've talked to this character himself anytime he liked ! Christie also employs a method I 've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot , the master detective . . . hire a detective ! In lieu of actually writing plot development , she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character . And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever , so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time . Normally I 'd decry this as a lazy author 's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action , but in Christie 's case I 'm charitable enough to substitute the word `` lazy '' with the word `` elderly , '' which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole , I have to admit that I would n't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan . But if you 're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote , then go for it . I am too , so I can sympathize . Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one . It 's just not up to Christie 's usual standards . Luckily , she wrote enough phenomenal , classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published , and all Christie newbies can rest assured : it gets a heck of a lot better than this .	-1
The best part of this book is probably unintentional on Clancy 's part . Jack Ryan succumbs to the seduction of power and turns into a sleazy politician.Throughout the seven Jack Ryan books , Jack has developed into a one dimensional superhero . By this book , his character is as thin and flat as a piece of cardboard . Throughout this book , he is the perfect , honest polictical outsider , single handedly cleaning up the American political system . The whole time he insists he does n't want the job . But , at the end of the book , once Ryan feels the power of kicking the butts of the liberal opposition and of the Iraqis , he changes his mind and says he will stay in office . Ryan turns into the lying , two-faced politician he said he hated.Besides the ending , this is mostly a miserable book . The first 400 pages are boring and repetitive . There some really good parts in the middle where all these intricate subplots get going . But most of these subplots go nowhere or are left dangling . There 's an exciting little war at the end , but it not enough to make up for the 1100 other pages that go nowhere.There are some minor problems with most of Clancy 's other books , but for the most part they are very good , exciting and entertaining . This book is a complete shock . It will be interesting to see if he can recover with the next book in the series , which was just released .	-1
This is the first X-Files novel I have read . I did n't expect deathless prose , but neither did I expect the writing to be quite so poor nor the plot to be so mediocre . This would make for a very average episode were it to be filmed for television . When I read a novel based on a television series , I want to see a story that puts the characters in situations that we ca n't see on the tube , be it for budget considerations , mature story content , or whatever . I have n't read anything alse by Charles Grant , but I understand that he has a reputation as a horror writer of some quality . If so , he must have cranked this one out in a hurry for the paycheck .	-1
It was interesting in a many worded way . The author had too many unconnected threads of plots that eventually wove together but it was a struggle to get to that spot .	-1
I would not recommend Phillipa Gregory 's much-hyped The Other Boleyn Girl . I 'm the sort of person who keeps reading a book that does n't make a good first impression , hoping it 'll improve . Some six-hundred pages later , I realized The Other Boleyn Girl never got good . Please do n't waste your time ! Gregory summed up executions of significant characters with lines such as `` He was executed the next day . '' Nothing triggers any emotional response in the reader ! It 's extraordinary . It seems as though Gregory went out of her way to make this possible.Of course , it 's a matter of opinion . I simply found it to be void of anything of substance . I was n't made to care about the characters or how the events played out . And only sex carried the plot along ! Also , I think a good amount of the book was from Gregory 's imagination , not historical facts . I 'm not trying to suggest Anne was never executed or she did n't have a sister or anything of the sort . And I know in this genre much is left to the author 's imagination and interpretation ; it has to be . It 's not as though there 's a record of everything that was said and done by everyone surrounding any given event in history . But Gregory herself , when asked how she researches for her books , said she first goes to secondary sources . She never mentioned using primary sources . Yes , they can be biased ( if they 're from someone 's perspective they 're going to be ) , but they 're first-hand accounts . Who better knows how something played out than a person who was in the middle of it , witnessing it ? In addition , her dialogue is inconsistent . It 's ridiculously modern at some points , then flowery at others . I know it ca n't be written Shakespeare-style ; it has to be readable and understandable . But I think we could be a little more sophisticated ! No one said `` stuff '' back then , for example , as in , `` All this stuff is making me mad . '' She could n't work a little harder than that ? ? If you want the stereotypical historical fiction whose foundation is built on fancy dresses , sex , and scandal , this soap-opera mimic is perfect . If you 're like me and want to learn something in the process , however ... As I 've made obvious , I was sorely disappointed . Just thought I 'd pass my warning along . I do n't want anyone else wasting his time !	-1
I really like the Sean Dillon character , but the books are getting worse and worse . There is no suspense . There is total casualness in every character because they know they wo n't die . They could face the Red Army single handed , any one of them , and come out unscathed . So what is their motivation ? None . What is mine to buy the next book ? None.Also , I am not what one would call a liberal , but the way Ferguson and Blake Johnson run around like judge , jury , and executioner offends even me . If they think you are a mobster or terrorist they kill you , and apparently the PM and President trust them so much that they would never reign them in . I 'd really like it in the next book if Blake Johnson would find dirt on some guy who gave a couple of million to the presidents campaign , and plan to indiscriminately kill him . It would at least show something that I could beleive when then President told him to just cover it up .	-1
Had I not been trapped in a car for hours with nothing better to do I would never have finished this horrid mess of a book . Eventually I decided to enjoy it as camp and parody , as if SNL had done a spoof of spy novels , and that made it a bit more fun . The book proper probably only deserves 2 stars . The characters are charicatures , the plotting vacillates between predictable and inconsistent , and there really is n't anyone to root for in the whole story once we get past the first couple of chapters . The most interesting characters are either killed off or just disappear from the story for no good reason . But this version gets a single star because this has to be one of the worst narrations in the history of recorded books . The breathy , melodramatic reading by Patrick Macnee almost drove me crazy until I decided to shift to parody mode . Then it fit . Maybe Macnee had to go there himself to get through this disaster.I have great admiration for anyone who makes a living writing , and for Mr. Higgins other successful books , but not every word put to paper has to see print . This one should have been left in a drawer somewhere .	-1
The Day of Reckoning is an exemplar of a novel at its worst . Sean Dillon and his all-star cast of superhuman vigilantes hardly inspire , and infact tend to irritate.My advice : This book is worse than the plague , so run away from it .	-1
will read when i get the time to go through all her books one right after the other . heard great reviews from a friend	-1
This novel took a long time for me to finish . I know this may be unfair of me to say , since I 'm not sure if Tan went through a lot of work for this novel , but I think it is just plain boring overall . I do n't know whether it is the raw subject matter about a Chinese woman trying to take care of her mother who is going through dementia , or whether it 's me . Maybe it is the subject matter -- a bit too depressing and I did n't want more things bringing me down in life unless it reveals something noble or lends an insightful slant on the depressing subject ( dementia , care for elderly parents , senior residential living places ) .Tan gives realistic details about growing up Chinese-American , such as the protagonist , Ruth , being the English spokeswoman for her mother , the accents , which , by the way , the author always does a great job in all her books , and the funny ways the daughter deals with the mother ( telling half-truths so that she does n't have to deal with her mother 's wishes or when she wants to do something simple like hire a housekeeper for the mother ) . The author included a subplot that went nowhere , the Dottie and Lance bit when Ruth was growing up . I guess that was just written as a taste of Ruth 's childhood ( ? ) .The part of the book that sort of picks up is whenever we read about the past life of the mother , LuLing , in China . This is a common thread in all the novels that I 've read by Tan . When the story goes back in time , it gets interesting . When it flashes to the present , the story is dull . LuLing 's history as the granddaughter of a bonesetter plays well , as do the parts about Precious Auntie and the tragedy behind her facial disfigurement and the American-run orphanage to which LuLing was left.The element that could have `` saved '' this book in my eyes was the dragon bones hidden by Precious Auntie that may belong to the Peking man 's bones . This thread in the story was just dropped , and nothing memorable came of it . I believe , if memory serves me correctly , the excavation work for these bones and the cave where the Precious Anutie hid the bones ( Monkey 's Jaw ) were destroyed when the Japanese came in and after that no other mention of the bones . If the author wrote something to tie in the bones and how it fits with the story , I think I could have liked this novel more . For instance , Tan could 've written that LuLing or Ruth went back at a later time to search out Monkey 's Jaw and found a remnant of these bones that she has kept to this day . I would pass on this novel and read Tan 's better works like The Kitchen God 's Wife , The Hundred Secret Senses , or The Joy Luck Club .	-1
Maybe this book should have been half as long . By the end of the book , I really had no interest in what Gogol was thinking or doing . The initial descriptions of the Ganguli family 's struggles to adapt to life in the United States was interesting both between generations and genders . I particularly liked the food adaptions . I felt more sympathy for Gogol 's parents and their struggles than for him.For those readers interested in a book for young people about a young girl and her family from India and her cultural adaption to Iowa , I recommend Blue Jasmine by Kashmira Sheth .	-1
The Sky is Falling , the latest of Sidney Sheldon 's books , is one of his worst . Sheldon found his formula for writing a best seller some books ago and ... he 's consistent . Sex , drama , wealth , power ... and the shallowist of characters and most fantastic of motives . Then add some travel , an exotic place or two , and a heroine with enough money and a dearth of brainpower . Bingo ! Another best seller.Do n't fall for it . It 's not a very good book .	-1
The first 75 % of this book was slow reading and boring in most parts . The end of the book finally became interesting . I found too much detailed information in housing construction .	-1
Meandering , amateurish writing with no conflict . Please save yourself the time of reading this unsatisfying book . I kept hoping that all the ideas that were introduced would be developed and paid off , but they never were . as I got later and later in the book , I thought perhaps there was a big surprise ending , but it never arrives ! Lots of interesting storylines are started - is there intelligent life on the new planet ? Will the starship stay and come into conflict with the native population ? Will the legions of sleeping crew awaken ? Will any of the crew abandon their mission , or natives stow away on the ship ? Will either betrayed lover freak and do something ? Will the VOLCANO go off for christ 's sake ? ? ? Nothing happens ! ! ! The book stomps all over Chekhov 's cardinal rule of drama - if you put a shotgun on the wall in the first act , it damn well better go off in the third . There are shotguns everywhere in this book but they remain dusty relics that add nothing but frustration to the experience of the reader.The love story is laughably dry , even though it should be a tension-filled shifting love triangle . You do n't read about any of it happening as it develops . You just get boring , lifeless updates after the fact . I did n't care about any of the characters - none of them have any goals , they are n't developed beyond the most rudimentary descriptors , and you do n't see them make any compelling choices , again we 're just told about their actions after the fact in the most boring , lifeless terms.The discussions of religion are amusing in moments , but on the whole pretty uncontroversial . Although the way it 's written , you can tell Clarke THINKS he 's blowing your mind . Maybe for some people it 's earth-shattering ( ha-ha ) , but again , even if they 're good ideas , there 's no reason to care about the ideas , because there 's nothing at stake , i.e . no story.seriously , there 's no story . for a moment mutiny is threatened , but it goes away after a polite meeting and one slightly interesting but totally perfunctory interrogation . i mean it , that 's IT . the love triangle goes nowhere . one character dies in a tidal wave and even THAT is completely undramatic , and he 's brought back to life in a completely routine way on the next page . yawn ! seriously . do n't read it.instead , if you have n't already , check out Childhood 's End , another Clarke novel , which is completely brilliant . It has good ideas AND a story , complete with conflict , tension and characters you actually care about . it 's still very cerebral , but in a way that works , unlike Songs of Distant Earth.Even the title never pays off in the way you want it to . The starship brings with it all the artwork , literature and music of obliterated earth , and there 's concern over how this influx of information will impact the young civilization . but then you never see any impact . there 's one very mundane concert at the very end with no aftermath , good or bad ! although the setup is there for some fascinating conflicts it just never pays off . kind of like the rest of the book . very disappointing .	-1
I love Paulo Coelho 's books but I must admit this is not one of my favorites . It 's a decent book but it lacks in many ways . The characters , thought process , and even originality.If you like the premise of this book , then I suggest you read `` The man that corrupted Hadleyburg . '' by Mark Twain . It 's much shorter than Coelho 's version and the idea is better developed . You can read it here for free : [ ... ] Or just google it , amazon will more than likely edit this post .	-1
Pages and pages of description of the landscape . Northwards this , downwards that , a tree here a hole there . I was basically losing my mind . I usually think the book is a better deal than the movie , but there is no point to spend so much time imagining so many different scenarios and nothing going on . I just didnt like it.Example : & quot ; The Company now turned aside from the path and went into the shadow of the deeper woods , westwardalong the mountain stream away from Silverlode . Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees , somo of which overhung the stream & quot ; & quot ; The hills now began to shut them in . The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen , but both were now hidden from view . The travelers came into a long valley ; narrow , deeply cloven dark and silent . Trees with old twisted roots hung over cliffs , and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-woods & quot ; And the whole thing is like that.GO WATCH THE MOVIE	-1
I know a lot of people love this story but i learned that its not for everybody.To much description about everything makes it hard to read because everything is slow and nothing much happens in a lot of time , the dialogs are ok .	-1
So you 've just seen the film and you absolutely ca n't wait for the next cinematic installment so you buy the book in the hope of quenching your curiosity . Naive consumer I blame you not . But before you purchase the book consider this . Obviously theres lots and lots of pages to this work so first ask yourself- is this something I 'm really interested in persuing ? Am I ready for this level of commitment in my life ? Secondly theres literally hundreds of charcters in this work which in itself requires a superlative mnemonic feat on part of the reader . Then there 's those numerous prolonged descrpitive passages which do very little to move the story along and are such a tremendous bore . And those maps ? All rather silly and contrived really . Their inclusion in the novel , far from enhancing the story , is quite distracting and only makes the reader self conscious of the fact that they 're reading a work of fiction . Kudos to old Tolky though for writing what is basically a sound storyline even if his ambition ultimately exceeded his ability to realize it . Person who will enevitably click & quot ; not helpful & quot ; button I have but two words for you- Mervyn Peake ( he did the whole fantasy schtick soooo much better ) .	-1
its hard to understand and you have to watch the movie before reading the book and i would recomend this one to maybe above 12	-1
This is the radio version of the the Lord of the Rings trilogy . It is not the unabridged reading of the three books : Fellowship , Two Towers , & amp ; Return . It is a 12 cassette dramatization . I was very disappointed when I realized what I 'd bought as I was looking for an unabridged reading of the three books .	-1
I studied under Iyengar teachers for over a decade including a teacher training and all sorts of workshops with `` senior '' teachers . While they know more than most on details of the physical body and pranayama practices , that is about the extent of a lot of Iyengar teachers knowledge in the west at least . Iyengar admits that he has proficiency in these limbs but not essential things like meditation and samadhi . Why he is writing a book on this subject without these qualifications is beyond me , yet people eat it up because of his popularity.What you get here is semantics and a bunch of confusing text that will not help your practice . Many people think this material is over their head after reading this translation , just because it is so badly written . His lack of subtle knowledge shows profusely when he ca n't even define a simple term like the Antahkarana ( inner organ ) properly . In this case he calls it a `` moral sense '' and that it is all . I 've read many versions of the sutras , most written by people with some degree of actual realization in the subtle realms , and he is the only one that completely gets these topics off . This concept is key for understanding how the mind functions and works in the yogic system and enough to put the book in the closet . To the best of my knowledge this book was ghost written along with the help of some of his students which might explain why it is so bad , and perhaps why he felt the need to write another book on the sutras ... Perhaps he realized a few more things in his old age . I do n't know . I 'd highly recommend Swami Hariharananda Aranya 's translation which is terribly in depth and from someone who has mastered the higher limbs of yoga . There is also `` Science of Soul '' by Shri Yogeshwaranand Parmahans which is not so much a commentary on the sutras , but sheds a lot of light about it 's philosophy in a practical and detailed manner from someone who spent many years in deep samadhi 's in the himalayas .	-1
I like giving good reviews , but I 'm sorry . This book was just too much hype and too simplistic . I had expected more . I think the best way to learn this program is to just dive in and start playing with it . The book was tossed ages ago .	-1
I have just reread this book . Perhaps it was my youth , or relative ignorance of history at that time , but I can not figure out why I was not as befuddled when I first read it as I am now . This book is completely illogical . An author may be forgiven for skewed character portrayals of historical figures ( see The Other Boleyn Girl for more , though that was actually a good novel despite all that horrible caricature of Anne Boleyn . ) But when these portrayals stretch credulity , when they all but fly in the face of history and common sense , and when the main fictional character 's actions cease to make sense because of this , then something has gone horribly wrong and the book needs to be rewritten.Our main character here is a fictional girl named Hannah Green , who has escaped Spain after the burning of her mother by the Spanish Inquisition . The Greens -- their real name is Verde -- are Jews , recently converted to Christianity , yet who still manage to secretly practice some Jewish tradition from time to time . She has a God-given Sight , and can predict the future . Soon she is discovered by Robert Dudley and begged as a holy fool to King Edward and then Queen Mary , whom history remembers as Bloody Mary for her burnings of heretics.Not only does Hannah stay in Mary 's service , but she absolutely ADORES the very queen who brings the Spanish Inquisition to England ! This queen who would probably send Hannah to the stake in a heartbeat if she found she was a Jew is portrayed as a overall nice woman , who only has to sacrifice heretics to the fire once in a while to feed her fragile conscience . I found this appalling . You may portray Mary as a pitiable figure , and I do consent that her life was a hard one , but to say that Mary is a good person with a loving heart who has simply been wronged is completely ridiculous . No one else can take blame for those burnings but Mary and Hannah 's love for her is totally unbelievable and unrealistic . Any self-respecting Jew ( or indeed , any self-respecting person ) would , if not hate her , have no respect for her . As another review said , she inherited the worst traits from both her parents . She has all Katherine of Aragon 's weakness coupled with Henry 's ruthlessness . I could n't understand Hannah 's feelings towards her . They made no sense.This following passage is from page 322 of The Queen 's Fool . It is characteristic of the portrayals in this novel . Will Somers is speaking of the queen 's plan to burn the Bishops Cranmer , Latimer and Ridley , and is concerned that the queen 's place in history will be ruled by this : '' History will remember nothing but that she was the queen who burned bishops ... she will be despised and forgotten and they will remember -- God knows who ! Elizabeth ! Mary Stuart ! -- some wanton girl instead of this true-hearted queen . `` I say , if you 're planning on burning bishops in the first place , you 're not so true-hearted . And all the Elizabeth-bashing ! It was just a little too much for Gregory to portray Elizabeth as a silly , selfish wanton , when she was a much better queen than Mary in all respects . However , my problem is not that I disagree with Gregory 's opinions on Mary and Elizabeth , because that should n't be a factor , but that it makes no sense for Hannah to love Mary and sometimes scorn Elizabeth . This makes not only an unlikable , idiotic character out of Hannah , but a generally unrealistic book with flat characterization . With Gregory , it 's largely hit and miss , and this was a miss . I would recommend anything else by her ( with the exception of The Constant Princess ) to anyone who likes fun , historical fiction , but this one 's joining TCP and The Wise Woman in the `` bad Gregory '' bin .	-1
I should have liked this a lot -- nicely noir , alluringly alternative history , etc . etc . But I made it about halfway through and abandoned the effort . Maybe it was the general bleakness of the whole mise en scene , or maybe it 's just a bad fit for me . My husband , for example , loved it . But after this and `` Final Solution '' , I sha n't feel obliged to try Chabon again soon .	-1
I usually adore Michael Chabon 's work , whether it be a quick read like `` Mysteries of Pittsburg '' or a hearty , slow-burn page-turner like `` The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay '' . Like other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating , I simply could n't get past the first few hundred pages of `` Yiddish Policemen 's '' . Initially , I felt dense , perhaps as if I was missing something crucial Chabon was trying to get across to me the reader . However , what really WAS missing were two of Chabon 's strengths : engaging language and characters the readers actually care about , even if they have a hard time liking them . If you ask the question `` I wonder what happens to this guy at the end of the book ? '' and the answer is `` Who cares ? `` , it 's time to put the book down , and move on to the next tome .	-1
I wanted to like this book , based on the wonderful reviews . I did enjoy the first few chapters , but the story kept getting bogged down and after several attempts to finish the book , I gave up . Another reviewer said that this was not a typical mystery , so maybe that is what I was looking for .	-1
I must really have misunderstood something here . In the first part of the book our hero runs into a bad guy . Although at first fearing a physical attack our hero finds himself in a battle of words with the bad guy . But it goes badly for the hero who simply can not say a thing right . In fact , the more our hero says the worse his position gets.So our hero walks away to think about this . During a moment of spiritual clarity he realises that he has no chance in a rational discussion with his enemy so our hero decides to kill the enemy . I was rather taken back by this and suspected that our hero would at a latter point in the story be punished for taking this course of action.But it never happens . Instead , we latter see the hero vindicated for his actions . I 'm a little surprised by this considering that this book contains so many Christian themes . I 'm not sure I can reconcile Christian ideals with this book 's message of killing people that you have problems talking with.However this is me making a mountain out of a molehill from something that happens early on . The majority of the book continues from the first book in the trilogy and is very dull . There 's little of anything to grab the attention .	-1
With the exception of an interesting theory on the difference between ghosts and spirits , this book was n't very helpful , informative nor interesting . There is a definite commercial slant as all of her `` answers '' are set-ups for her to refer you to her other books , etc . Glad I checked it out from the local library instead of paying for it .	-1
The cover tells it all . You only see the horse 's rump . If the book is called Seabuscuit , put the horse 's FACE on the cover . And no race stats either ! ?	-1
If you 're a writer/painter/musician yourself , how could you help but bridle at the assertion that Vermeer 's greatest successes were due to the suggestions of his cleaning lady ? The ultimate & quot ; I do n't know much about art , but I know what I like & quot ; book . Dully written and offensive in the extreme .	-1
I gave this book 2 stars because of the pictures in the book . If your eyes are 20/20 good for you . You can probably read the book , however if you wear bifocals do n't buy this book . The size of the book is about 3 '' by maybe a bit over 4 1/2 '' . Hazel gives good tips on mixing oolors etc.There are a lot of nice pictures to look at if you can see them . This is not the type of book you can lay out on your work table and refer to , it is way too small and anoying.If the book is published in a normal size work book it would be worth buying , however it is very small and I would not recommend to anyone for purchase .	-1
After waiting for the 3rd book in Dean Koontz 's Frankenstein Trilogy I was very disappointed in how over the top the story was . I love Dean 's books but once in awhile he takes the weirdest just a little too far.You can tell at the end he 's going to continue with this series . I hope the story gets back on track to the page turner the 1st and 2nd books were .	-1
Well here we are , the final part Book 3 is here . Was it worth the wait - NOT REALLY . I went back and re-read the first two in order to do Part 3 justice . I spent the first few chapters of Part 3 with explainations concerning things from the first two books , this would not have been necessary if the trilogy had been completed in a timely manner . Result - Boring . I kept skipping parts - to me a sudden death for a book . Parts seemed familiar to me , I kept thinking I had already read the story , knowing that I could n't have - I have read a lot of Koontz 's books . Whatever his two collaborators on the first two books brought to the story was definitely missed on Part 3 , its reminds me of `` lets get it over with '' and it did not complement Parts 1 & 2 . To me the trilogy is still unfinished and now never will be .	-1
I was carrying Wolf Hall under my arm in a grocery store when a rather nice woman came over to me and said , `` I gave up at page 300 . '' I thought , `` After all the awards this novel has garnered , I wo n't be having a similar experience . '' I was wrong . I quite at around page 270 . Clearly , Ms. Mantel know how to research an exhilarating era . Sadly , she does n't know much about transferring that excitement to the page . And I 'm not alone . I have two other friends , both readaholics , who gave up , and only one who fought to the finish . Her choice of verb was `` slog '' to the finish . I ca n't comprehend how this effort has won all of these awards . Please someone explain . Was it a slow year for literature ?	-1
I could n't wait to get to the end of this book . It was very hard to understand who `` he '' was throughout the book . Cromwell , or someone else ? In Vanity Fair Christpher H. described it as a great read ; I bought it on this advice and was so disappointed , not only reading it but realizing I had also bought it and tried to read it several years earlier .	-1
About 1/3 of the way through this book , I deleted it from my Kindle . I have read many books on the Tudors but this one I simply could n't get through . It was boring , confusing and not even a little entertaining . So disappointing ...	-1
I found it difficult to follow . Did n't like the characters . I had heard such wonderful things about this book and I really was not impressed . I struggled halfway through and then gave up .	-1
After attempting to read this book and others that have been awarded the Booker award , I can just say that this award has absolutely no credibility with me anymore .	-1
Although seen from the perspective of Thomas Cromwell , a villain made a protagonist by authoress Hillary Mantel , we find here the same tedious antics of the Tudor court and city of London in the years between the mid 1520 's and mid 1530 's , when Anne Boleyn attracted the fancy of Henry VIII who was slowly willing to destroy Catholic and noble England to satisfy his misplaced sexual needs and more importantly his misunderstood dynastic needs . It is a novel but accurate enough to be a history , neither of which is currently in short supply . Heaven only knows why the book was written and why it is being read.The best line in the story is by someone who has spent time in Italy . He says that were Queen Katherine of Aragon , Henry 's unsuited wife , in Italy she would long since have lain in her cold grave . The English do things differently from the Italians but the result is the same .	-1
instead of exploring the motivation to move to the remote region and describing the impact of her move on her life and her writing Bird Cloud reads like a disjointed extended whine about cost over runs wandering cows and the frustrations of picking paint colors . It is about as interesting as watching paint dry . Shame o Ms Proulx for her self indulgent rant .	-1
I was unable to read this book . Within the first twenty pages , it had become such a waste of time that I gave up . Boring accounts of clothes upon clothes and not at all well-written . Characters were as dull as the clothes .	-1
not really crazy about the way it was writtenand to think of what was happening it was sadshe most of the time felt very alone	-1
I 've been enjoying Dean Koontz since the 60 's when he , along with Steven King , burst onto the Science Fiction - Fantasy scene . So innovative , such skillful young writers , and so productive under their own names and several pen names were they , that some critics postulated that they were in fact a single pseudonymous wunderkind ! Over the years , we 've learned to recognize their differences , and despite career highs and lows we all have our favorite . Mine has always been Koontz - but with gradually growing reservations.Koontz greatest weakness has been the inability to end a book book with a real , slam-bang climax . We 've become used to completing 400 pages of high speed , high energy story telling with half a dozen tepid paragraphs of : `` but it all got better , and everyone went home '' . `` Breathless '' definitely exhibits that failure , in aces ! Whether alien encounter or divine intervention - and that is not clearly resolved - this story ends with total wet blanket.Over the years , Koontz 's stories have started to include greater and greater intrusions of his own right wing philosophies . From boringly repetitive descriptions of both protagonists and villains military-style arsenals , and GlennBeckian rants on societal decline , he has moved on to government tyranny , weird fundamentalist biblical `` science '' , and conspiracy theory explanations of the most innocuous groups and institutions ( see his fevered `` history '' of that most harmless rural social organization The Grange , in `` The Dead Town '' ) . Again , all of these elements are present in `` Breathless '' , but by now they have ceased to by boring , but easily skipped , asides and have become an essential , unavoidable part of the story . In addition , while Koontz has commonly been noted for strong female characters , active in the story line , in `` Breathless '' the main female character is weak and compliant . There is also a new strain of misogyny which , while usually placed in the mouth , or the mind , of a villain is expressed with a kind of glee that leaves the reader repelled.Despite all of this , I have continued to read Koontz and derive enough pleasure from his inventive story telling , and stylish writing - until `` Breathless '' . This book is summed up in my review title - a tragic mess . All of his faults come to a combinatorial climax , in the service of a totally silly premise , a disordered presentation , and some of the worst writing he has ever published . It is hard to decide whether to liken the writing in this book to a cruel lampoon of Koontz , or to the plagiaristic effort of a sad , teenage fanboy . Take you choice , either way it 's that bad.In `` Breathless '' , one can see Dean Koontz , not as a rival of Steven King , but instead as King-created character , a tragi-comic loser , condemned by his own hubris .	-1
I LOVE Koontz , and absolutely hate giving him a bad review , but this book just is n't worth 5 stars . What happened to the ending ? I agree with the reviewers that said the ending seemed chopped or incomplete . A whole lot of buildup of supense , and then ... ... ... ... .nothing ! !	-1
I have read everthing this author has written . His early works were teriffic , his last efforts have fallen short . Instead of releasing 2 books per year , perhaps one well written novel would be an idea . Breathless , was a such a disappointment . I read this book in a aftrenoon ! The double spacing in the recent books , has not gone unnoticed . I am thinking perhaps Dean should leave the Horror story genre and just write books about dogs . This seems to be were his passion has gone . I will have to seriously consider whether or not to purchase his next book .	-1
`` The Ice Princess '' was just barely entertaining enough to hold my interest . The plot is okay , but the writing is uninspired and amateurish . Maybe it 's just the English translation that seems heavyhanded and sophomoric , almost as if it were written for the YA crowd . More than likely , however , the translator did n't have all that much to work with . Lackberg 's bio indicates she embarked on novels after taking a writing course , and her lack of natural talent is obvious . Perhaps it is n't all that hard to get published in Sweden.On the upside , the peek into everyday Swedish life and culture is interesting if sometimes a little weird -- as in sitting on one 's mittens to avoid getting a UTI from a park bench , even though presumably fully dressed in winter clothing . ( But then , maybe I missed some sort of inside joke with that one . ) Lackberg 's writing and characters are n't in the same class with Larssen and his fascinatingly psychotic hacker , Lisbeth Salander . Savvy American readers are likely to find her stuff a little too juvenile .	-1
This kindle version of One , Two , Buckle My Shoe does not have the last chapter . It could be that the book ends where this version stops , but in fact the book does not end there . If you want the ENTIRE book , this is not the product for you.Also , however this version was created there are wrong word usages sprinkled throughout , so it is n't very well edited.Otherwise , you ca n't go wrong with Agatha Christie !	-1
When my daughter was 8 she and I loved the Goosebumps books . They were appropriately juvenile and fun . `` Fragment '' reads like a 500 page Goosebumps title . Other reviewers have commented on the terrible characterization , high school level writing and awful plot . Like the `` Harry and the Hendersons '' ending , all of which make the book laughable . Or pathetic . Take your pick.I 'll concentrate here on the ridiculous errors in basic science in the book . Now , I know that books of fiction are not to be judged on the same basis as a term paper . But authors have a basic responsibility to get the facts right . So , here we go.Page 74 . `` clots on contact with dangerous endotoxins , like E. coli . WRONG . E. coli is a bacteria . It 's not a toxin.Page 75 . Injecting tap water or distilled water would kill someone . Utter nonsense.Page 77 . `` reddish-green trilobite fossils '' . The color of the rock one finds fossils in has nothing to do with the color of the original creature.Page 135 . The creature has both a cloaca AND an anus ? I do n't think so . A cloca is defined as a common opening for urine , feces and reproductive processes . So you ca n't have both.Page 188 . Earthworm life span is about a year , not a decade.Page 189 . Queen termites do n't live 100 years . Maybe several years.Page 191 . `` Bullfrogs frequently get isolated in ponds ... '' No they do n't . When water levels drop , they just hop away to other ponds.Page 218 . `` The sophistication of the nervous system is just staggering for an animal of this size . '' How could Dr. Cato know this ? They have no instruments that would allow them to make such a judgment . In fact , such a conclusion would require a sophisticated neuroscience laboratory and months , if not years , of study.Page 218 . Jumping spiders do NOT , repeat NOT , have the largest brain to body ratio of any animal . They DO have the largest ratio among spiders.Page 334 . A fatal dose of anethesia does NOT cause a build up of magnesium in the blood.These are only the blunders that were most obvious . They show the author 's contempt for the facts and thus for his readers.I should mention that there is one really terrifying sentence in the book . On the inside back cover we read that the author is `` at work on a sequel to Fragment '' . Please , noooooooooooooooooooo	-1
This is not a good book to read . It just is n't interesting and does n't keep you going on to read more .	-1
Sad to say , I ca n't finish this book . I had a hard enough time getting through his last Odd book , Odd Apocalypse . I started this one with high hopes , but when I began to skimm pages just to get to a place where SOMETHING was happening , I knew the end was near . I think Mr. Koontz needs to put this character away and go back to the way he wrote before this series started . I will say that I loved Odd Thomas in the first four books , but the last two - well , I think I 've covered that .	-1
Liberalism has created several generations of parasites who think their country can be at war - that they can stand beside soldiers at war - and not take sides . The world is the way it is because of them . The only hope we have for a better world is with the soldiers he thinks he is better than .	-1

I 'm sure Louie is an amazing man , and I commend him for his accomplishments . I found this book immature and almost like watching one of those tv shows that give you narrated little snippets with & # 34 ; amusing & # 34 ; tag lines and over the top music and laugh tracks .	-1
While the story of this man 's ordeal is heartbreaking , the book itself is just boring . Way too much time spent on useless details about airplane minutiae and similar items .	-1
Extraordinarily disappointing book . I did n't realize it was a commercial for Billy Graham until I was about two-thirds through the book . I certainly would n't have bought it or read it had I known it was a touchy-feely Christian tract . Parts were interesting , but only because I was stationed in Japan during the Korean war . I would n't waste my time on this one ... .I did n't finish the book . If Louie turns out to be a flaming atheist , someone please tell me .	-1
This is a story for the ages . Of hard work , hope , faith in the face of evil and the indominitability of the human spirit . Yet Hillenbrand lards it with pointless detail , zigs across time in confusing fashion and makes it hard follow . Were I not reading this book to connect with a troubled employee who enjoyed it , I 'd have bailed .	-1
Gad ! Slogging through so many disagreeable people in the first 50 pages was a chore . I tried , really tried to find why so many gave this good reviews . How could one small town have so many annoying , slightly insane people ? The author has five chidren . Did she experience any of the dreadful constantly screaming chidren and how is it that none of the mothers in the book able to cope with any of them . There is no threat to Nesbo and/or Mankell with this tedious style overloaded with subplots and moronic characters .	-1
So , I had seen this at the local bookstore and decided to purchase this on my kindle . For me , this book ended up being a waste . What we have here is a 14 year old prince that narrates what 's going on as if he 's a man of 25 , and to be honest it just does n't feel believable . Something about the way it 's written , not sure exactly what but I could n't get into it . Mostly it 's just that we are supposed to believe all this stuff the prince does at the age of 14 , and I also was n't a fan of the transitions to `` four years ago '' . These time period shifts were jarring and most of the times took me out of the story . I would not recommend this book , but that 's just my opinion	-1
What a steaming pile of dog doo this turned out to be . It was tolerable until it got near the end . I still do n't get why they dispatched the ex-street hood , to tie up the `` loose ends '' of the female protagonist . Let 's see , she was a crime desk reporter for years , and they think the only people who will notice she is gone are her boss , and the people she was writing her last story about . Oh , and torching her apartment is supposed to erase her . Just seems like that would have the police looking for her . What was up with that ? I 'm still shaking my head at that bit of idiocy . And then they were supposedly killing the last people she spoke with on the phone . BUT they leave out the professor , she had contacted by phone , who knows the most about these `` monks . '' AND she had just been with this professor minutes before they find her abandoned phone . GIVE . ME . A . BREAK . I do n't see the comparison with this and the Da Vinci Code . At least Dan Brown had the courtesy to rip off a book that had extensive research . I sincerely doubt the author did any research on Turkey . Or if he did , it was the turkey that is served at dinner . Unfortunately , this came off more like burnt toast . And to think this is a trilogy and there will be two more installments . Although , there were enough gaping holes to fill two books , I doubt they will be remedied in the future books . About the only good thing I can say about this book , is I caught it when it was free . Count me out on the next two , as I do n't care to waste any more time on this hot mess .	-1
How this pile of steaming drek got to be an `` International Best Seller '' is the real mystery here . It was arduous work just trying to overlook the incongruity of a story set in `` ancient '' Turkey where all the characters spoke perfect English and used American idioms.Especially off-putting was the flitting back and forth between locations , which challenged the reader to remember just who the hell he was being talked about in each new chapter . Characters came and left in the space of a few sentences . Descriptions did n't lend to the imagery one was supposed to imagine because they were trying to be too cute . A great discontinuity existed between the `` hi tech '' lighting system and the torches monks carried to light their way in various tunnels . Never mind the ventilation needed to keep from asphyxiating themselves.I could go on , but why bother ? I struggled to finish it -- I wanted to see if it got better towards the end . It did n't .	-1
I do n't know about the rest of the readers but I had another answer for the question posed in the final chapter ( i.e. , can a book about a boy never having the girl be enough for a good novel , in this case no ) .The errors in Northwest geography ( e.g . where Whitman is , the relationship of Portland to the coast , the difference between clams and oysters ) were not offset by the author 's ill-disguised rants about Lithium treatment ( Disclaimer : I worked with the physican that introduced Li treatment of Manic-Depressive Illnesses to North America ) . Does this guy have a thing with chemical control of mood or what ? Anyway , I thought the characters were shallow and the book only got off the ground when it was putting the boots to deconstructionism ( what did they think would come out of letting a lot of bright but uninsructed young people educate themselves but a bunch of adolescent nihlism ) .Otherwise temptingly well written but like Stephen King & John Cheever 's books not much substance.djc	-1
This book was awful . You keep reading and it goes nowhere . His other book Middlesex was great . Skip this one . Tries too hard and does n't deliver .	-1
i kept reading this book even when i knew i just was n't getting into it - i hate to put a book down and not finish it - i always think there is something i 'm missing - the best part is the next chapter - but i could n't find it in the marriage plot . though i very much liked mitchell 's character , i could n't warm to the others and by the end i was just skimming through it . i 'm not saying it was a bad book , or badly written . just did n't gel with me .	-1
This book was sadly a serious let down . I really expected a lot more based on the reviews I read . In addition to the reviews , this author won a Pulitzer , which contributed to my high expectation . I do n't enjoy giving bad reviews , so I wo n't come down too hard on this book , but I must admit I actually fell to sleep twice while trying to read this book ! And trust me , this never happens ! ! ! The boring cover art is a good representation of what you are going to be reading . In my personal opinion , none of the characters in the book are remotely likable . They are all really pathetic . Madeline is a sorry , sappy needy young woman . Mitchell is a lovelorn man who does n't get the woman of his dreams and he spends the entire book wishing that he and Madeline would somehow be together . Leonard , clinically , manically depressed Leonard . That description sums up his character . All in all , the characters are full of teenage angst . Too much of it . There is no light at the end of the tunnel for any of them . Leonard is the only one who even has a `` pass '' on how sad his character is and that 's only because he is genuinely sick . In my personal opinion , there is no real character growth for any of these unfortunate characters . How the characters are in the beginning is how they are at the end of the book ...

I read the first book , Divergent , and thought it was entertaining and interesting . But the second one became very tiresome and tedious very quicky . I got so tired of hearing the main character lament this and lament that . I just wanted to shout at her , `` GET OVER YOURSELF ! '' She always goes against what everyone else is doing , and LO AND BEHOLD she is always right . This theme repeats itself over and over and over and over ... ( just like I am repeating myself over and over and over and over ... . Can you see why this book gets tedious ? ? ? ) I wo n't even look for the third book . Unless I need some kindling for my fireplace.Save you youself some time and avoid this book . And there really is n't a cliff hanger . It just ends .	-1
Oh , Insurgent . How you 've disappointed me . While I did n't much care for Dauntless in the first book , I did like how it examined the idea of a society divided into factions based on a person 's nature . It was an intriguing concept and it really allowed for a lot of room for Roth to explore and make some insightful commentary on human nature . Which she did do . Four 's stance on the Dauntless made me want to cheer . He was clearly someone who got it , and the ending of Divergent made me eager to find out what would happen when the insight spread . Alas , it did not spread . Spoilers to follow.First off , I just want to rant about Dauntless . Though I thought all of the factions in this book exhibited very questionable judgement , Dauntless fails on all counts . I can buy that some of them were loyal to Eric and thought the Erudite plan was nifty . Fine . But , people , they used mind control on you ! I simply can not buy the idea that more of the Dauntless would n't have defected , especially since it seems to me that this kind of control should be contrary to their very nature . Yet , no matter what happens to them throughout the course of Insurgent , the Dauntless insist on being impractical to the point of lacking a sense of self-preservation . This really drove me straight up the wall . They came across as exactly what Four/Tobias more or less said they were : a bunch of adrenaline junkies who ca n't manage to squeeze two brain cells together in order to have a rational thought . And Tris is really no exception.As for Tris , I really liked her and really sympathized with her in Divergent . I could understand wanting to break free of a constrictive role , wanting to embrace a more exciting way of life . In this book , she simply seems to have a death wish . For all the Tris is supposed to be Divergent , she is blindly Dauntless for the vast majority of this book . She never really stops to question her actions and decide if the choices she 's making are really good ones . What 's more , she keeps things from Tobias and then gets angry when he has a problem with it . I get that you 're afraid he 'll judge you and cast you aside , I get that you 're angry that he 's keeping things from you , but how can you expect him to be up front when you refuse to be honest ? I 'm not excusing Tobias 's actions , because I really thought he treated Tris like an infant for a good portion of the book , but it 's like she expected him to adhere to a higher standard than she adhered to herself . That 's not cool . Why , then , is she surprised when he wo n't really listen to what she has to say , and when he questions her judgement ? The whole nature of their relationship in this book was annoying to me . What do these two people like about one another ? The attraction was clear and made sense in Divergent , here it does n't . It almost feels like they 're together because that 's where they plot left them , not because they really want to be together . This is not an equitable relationship : neither party is honest with the other and they both adamantly refuse to talk through their problems . As much as I liked Tobias in Divergent , I did n't much like him here , though I was more sympathetic to him than I was to Tris . By the end of the book , Tris just seemed like a self-destructing idiot.I also really disliked the characterizations of the other factions . Amity 's passivity is totally inexplicable , as is Candor 's . We 're talking about a situation where two factions teamed up and slaughtered all but a handful of people from another faction and Candor and Amity do n't see any reason to be concerned ? I get that Roth was maybe making a statement about human nature here and , while I do get people tend to sink into denial rather than face danger , people also have a sense of self-preservation that is remarkably lacking here . The other thing I could not get past was the question of what good is Candor ? The other factions all had a purpose , but Candor seemed completely superfluous , which ruined me belief in the world Roth has created.Lastly , I was extremely uncomfortable with the treatment of the factionless , and I hope this is something that 's going to be further developed in the last book . It made me shake my head to think that the factions could n't grasp the fact that the people they exploited and condemned to a life of mere subsistence might choose to rise up against them . Gee , how unexpected ! All in all , this book felt like so much filler . I had the sense that I was on a world tour of the Divergent/Insurgent universe , and that did n't do the book any favors . Tris and Tobias bounce from one place to another with no real purpose , and it is n't until the end of the book that a key plot point is revealed . I do want to finish the series because of that plot point , but it was too late in Insurgent for it to save the book for me . Honestly , I suspect that , when all is said and done , Insurgent could be cut out completely and the real meat of the story could be told solely in Divergent and the third book .	-1
After reading the first book of the series I was stoked to read Insurgent . Needless to say , this book was frustrating to read . I spent half the book pissed off at the main character , causing me to take forever to finish this book . It ended well and it makes me curious to read the third installment of the series . But I 'm skeptical..	-1
I have to agree with many other reviewers that the final , 3rd book of the series is a great disappointment . I think Roth was finished with the second book but pushed by the money mongers to write a third . The voices of Tris and Tobias are indistiguishable . The ending disappointing to be kind . Here 's hoping Roth goes on to another story and writes like the first two of this series again .	-1
This is what you get . Unfortunately this series of novels took the worst of both and came up with this teenage drivel . I 'm the type of reader that once I pick up a book , I read it to the conclusion no matter how awful . I kept hoping the main characters would be killed off so the pain would end , but no , it continued to the bitter end . Curse my bad habit .	-1
The first book had something new in introducing factions while the last one will have ( hopefully ) some climax and twist while this one is almost a senseless wandering.The author has some fascination for & # 34 ; eavesdropping & # 34 ; - used at least three times for the smart Tris to learn things of importance . At another instance , she is guided in her dream . Such highly juvenile tricks turn worse when the author tries to use or fight against technology : if it was hard disk in the first book , it is death serums and simulations that fail in the most idiotic ways possible . The way the leads escape tricky situations would not have worked even in the movies of the fifties.The worst part is that the much awaited big twist never appears and remains reserved for the next book .	-1
I loved Divergent , but absolutely hated this book . How much torture , battering , and damage can a persons body take and never give up . Every few pages there was some new drug being shot into Tris neck and she was being battered in some way.No real story , just a lot of torture and thinking up new ways to inflict more . And the most lame ending after wbat bappened I have ever hear . I hate a book where you feel like it is all being thought up only as it goes along and when they feel that it has gone on long enough the wind it up and a nice little bow on the last two pages . Even though it got tied up , it was a stupid ending thst was really no ending at all . I will not make the mistake of thinking that the next book will be any good either . I will not buy another one of her bookd .	-1
When I first discovered Divergent in summer 2013 , I absolutely devoured it in under 24 hours . Thanks to Kindle magic , I grabbed Insurgent minutes later , likewise consuming it in two marathon reading sessions . I was hooked , and pre-ordered Allegiant on the spot . Several months later on release day , I downloaded Allegiant not long past midnight . It put me to sleep . Every time I 'd start to read it , I just could n't get into it . I was baffled that an author whose work I could n't put down I had become so meh about.And then it occurred to me -- I was continually going back and forth to the chapter beginning to see who 's POV I was reading again . Tris and Tobais are essentially characterized the same , and moreover , Tobias in Allegiant is nothing whatsoever like Four . The characters are just ... flat.Add to that staid prose and a dull plot that employs Insane Troll Logic . It leaves you with a book where you ca n't really empathize with the cardboard characters , and a plot that leaves you saying , & # 34 ; Yeah , whatever. & # 34 ; I can forgive crappy plots when I am engaged emotionally with the characters . Sadly , I was not.I 've seen a lot of other reviewers complain about the ending . I feel that was actually the strongest writing of the book . The middle just felt like a lot of filler to get to that end point . I suspect even Roth was bored for most of the book . It was when she let go of the convention of Chapter 1 Tris , Chapter 2 Tobias , Chapter 3 Tris ... and just let the narrative flow from a single viewpoint for a while , that the prose was more compelling . It begs the question , is this a story that Roth WANTED to tell , or was it a novel Roth 's publisher PUSHED her to tell because Trilogy=Box Office Capital ? God forbid somebody in Hollywood tries to turn Allegiant into Parts 1 and 2 because there 's barely enough compelling content there for a single story .	-1
I found the POV too hard to follow in this book . They were written in the same voice , so I found myself flipping back to remember who I was supposed to be listening to . The end ... where to begin ? I 've never closed a book and thought , `` no , that is n't how it ended . '' If a Gladiator type ending was wanted , it just was n't written with enough poignancy or feeling . But I also think someone has to go through these type of things ( i.e . complicated sacrifice and loss ) to be able to effectively communicate them . It would be interesting to see how Ms. Roth would write the end as she gets older ( and has children - understanding the true goal of a parents sacrifices for their children a bit more ) . But that 's not really something she can control right now . It just is n't something I liked , agreed with or felt satisfied in reading . Sorry .	-1
If you 've read the first two books and loved them , be satisfied with that . Do n't pick this one up.The book started out okay , but I was immediately thrown off by the change in viewpoint . In this book each chapter switches between the two main characters . I 've read books written like this before and they were great . Unfortunately , with Allegiant , I often had to flip back a few pages to remember which character is telling the story . It was hard to follow . By the time I was a few chapters into the book , it started to drag . I read each of the first two books in 2 days . When I got into the third book , I kept setting it down . It just did n't hold my attention.The worst part was the end . I wo n't spoil the ending for you by telling more . I 'm sure the right internet search would tell you . I 'll just say it was a horrible ending .	-1
Such a disappointing end to the otherwise excellent trilogy . I wish I had n't read this book . I would have been better off using my imagination to decide how it all ended . I wo n't be buying the Four series now as a result of this book . I 'm done giving money for something so ridiculous .	-1
Worst end to a trilogy -- EVER . Divergent was pretty good ; Insurgent was OK ; Allegiant was terrible . Not just the ending ( I guess everyone knows that Tris dies ) , but because the story made absolutely no sense . I read a ton of fantasy books . I know you have to suspend belief to immerse yourself in the 'world ' the author creates . But the storyline still has make some sense . There are lengthy reviews already written in detail about this book , so I wo n't go through it all again . Really really do n't understand the hype around this series . I thought it was one of the worst of the bunch out there . The Legend series is much much better -- well written and interesting .	-1
Ok. Just to start off , I am a HUGE Veronica Roth fan . My friend and I have tried relentlessly to get our other friends to read Divergent . Reading this book , I REALLY wish that I did n't even START reading the series , but , boredom in Taos when your family is on a ski trip miles away from your friends who have `` other plans '' ca n't be helped.So , I have been amazingly excited for this book.The plot ( at the beginning ) was the same sort of thing as the other books in the series . The `` perfect '' faction system is being disrupted by something/one , and it needs to be fixed . In the first book , it was Jeanine Matthews who was the criminal . In the second , it was the huge number of Dauntless traitors and the Erudite . In this one , well , I 'm not saying anything.I was fascinated with the idea of telling some of the story from Tobias 's point of view at the beginning , but when I got to the end of the book , I can see why it was necessary . Another thing that I was intrigued by was Tris 's mother 's backstory . I thought that it was well- written , and it had some things in it that I did n't even expect . I mean , yeah , just before it was revealed , I saw it coming , but it answered questions that I do n't think that ANYONE would think of asking.The main attraction for me , as a 14 year-old girl , was the love story . My best friend in the entire universe ( a.k.a the girl who introduced me to this series ) would just call me crazy . She really does n't like love stories . Anyway , the love story was really good in this book , but it does get a little bit mature at one point . There was n't much detail put in it ( thank goodness ) , but , I definitely would not recommend that children 11 and younger should read that scene . There was also a LOT more kissing in this book than in the others ( *giggling because I am NOT telling my best friend about that , and I 'm going to be evil and make her find out on her own* ) , which I was glad about , considering the end of the book.And now , for the last ( and definitely most least that you can get ) point I 'm going to make . *clears throat and drinks some water* All right , here goes : WHY THE HECK DID YOU DO THAT , VERONICA ROTH ? ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! OHMYGOD , WHY DID I WAIT FOR SUCH A LONG TIME JUST TO HAVE A HUGE FREAKING DISAPPOINTMENT ? ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I GET THAT YOU DID N'T WANT TO HAVE YOUR BOOK END LIKE EVERY OTHER YA ROMANCE OUT THERE , BUT STILL , WHY COULD N'T YOU END IT WITH A BREAKUP ? ? ? ? DID YOU HAVE TO MAKE ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS DIE ? ? ? DID YOU HAVE TO ? ? ? BECAUSE I DO N'T SEE THE FREAKING POINT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Meltdown complete.The ONLY reason that I gave this book a 2 star rating was because the love story was interesting .	-1
This has to be one of the most boring books I have ever read . The first two books in the series were n't lighting the world on fire as far as plot , or sense , but this book makes the first two look like well thought out tomes of glory.I had to skip 3/4 of the book . The middle was so much drudgery . I ca n't even express the overwhelming desire I had to put it down . I have never been one to read the last few chapters of a book just to get through it , but I had to do that with this story.Then I got to the ending and was glad I skipped most of the book . This book is truly a waste of time . Seriously . Even if you enjoyed the first two and were willing to suspend disbelief enough to admit that you found them entertaining , this book was not worth picking up . Just finish the plot line in your head using your imagination . I guarantee you will have a much better ending than what Roth presented here.I read the books because I saw the previews for the upcoming movie and it looked like something I would be interested in . Well , I hope Hollywood changes the ending drastically or the movies will be stinkers too . I do n't think I want to watch them if they stay true to the books.I ca n't believe I just wasted hours of my life on this series . What a dud .	-1
I do n't even know where to start . The ending to this series is so ridiculously unrealistic . So many things do not make sense , there are major holes in the plot and even the characters were unlikeable . I understand that this is a YA book , but I honestly ca n't get behind how these teenagers can outsmart the adults unless they are in cohorts with Scooby Do.I was bugged by the unnecessary `` kissing '' scenes that I do not want my daughter reading . Why ca n't these YA authors put in light kissing without putting hands in people 's clothing and insinuate heavy petting ! Major bug when it comes to these YA books that I have to tell my daughter she ca n't read . Still debating if ill let her read this one . ( Btw-she is all but 12 ) I loved the first 2 books in this series and ca n't say how disappointed I am by this one . Bah ! !	-1
I feel like many others do about this ending book of the series . I did n't like it at all . The first two books were great , deserving of 5 stars , but this was a huge disappointment.I did n't like the switching of narrative from Four to Tris ! It was very difficult to get into the characters switch and I found myself confused several times and had to re-read many pages . I have never seen this type of narrative switch and if I find that it is in any book , I will definitely pass on the book . It has no redeeming value.The narrative was boring most of the time , with a weak story line that did n't fit the first two books . The answer to what was outside the borders of the first two books was , in itself , a disappointing twist . I started to say that it was n't believable , but that is an oxymoron in fantasy fiction . It just did n't seem to suit the story line.The way it ended was extremely disappointing ! ! ! ! To come that far being a champion of Tris to see it ended in that manner made me want to stop reading immediately . I kept on , thinking that Roth would come up with some twist that would negate this egregious turn of the plot . That left EVERYTHING in seeming limbo with absolutely no good feelings about how the book ends.A very big disappointment overall .	-1
There a better YA dystopia books out there with better main characters and a less lazy writer . A little slower paced than the second book , but everything else just was worse . Honestly , I would n't have bothered to finish the series if I had n't already bought it for cheap in a flash sale with the first book .	-1
What a bummer ending . Slow and boring . There was no creative element to the writing . Just bland dialog and basic descriptions .	-1
Ruined the entire series for me . All the character development from the first two books was ignored as if it had never happened . The pace was excruciating . & # 34 ; Death serum & # 34 ; is a nonsensical concept . Why create a serum that convinces the brain to shut down , when poison effectively does the same thing , reliably , no matter your genetic status ? The ending was repellent because it was unnecessary . If the event had not happened , the overall plot would have concluded in the same way , only somewhat more satisfying . WHY ? ? ?	-1
Wanted my happily ever after but I got a rushed ending instead . It 's like the author was tired of the story ( you can tell by the rushed ending and repetitious story line ) and decided to kill off any hope if another book . Still was an ok read , just hope Hollywood does better	-1
It 's a rarity , I know , nearly impossible even . But there was a mistake at the printers with my copy of this book . You see some pages from a completely different story , got accidentaly inserted randomly into Allegiant . So the story I read was incomplete , with some stuff that was n't even part of the story . It was a printing issue . Very uncommon . Oh , wait , I read an ebook . Well then it 's digital . Anything can happen in the digital world . Really , it happened . It 's the only explanation .	-1
This was the worst planned out series I have ever read . While I loved Divergent with it 's rich characters and interesting plot , its apparent there was no foresight into the entire series until the end . I realize this is a young adult series , but really ? ? I ca n't believe a publisher would actually print this ... other than to keep the money machine going.Spoilers : First of all , the idea that they are living in Chicago and have no idea what lies so close to them outside the fence should be explained . Its so ridiculous that with a faction that values facts and knowledge , no one would never attempt to go outside the fence ... and just miles past the fence is a whole city/compound that flies planes for goodness sake . Even in fiction , this is ludicrous and draws the reader ( at least me ) so far out of the story I ca n't buy into any of it . A well thought out plot would have weaved these answers in from the beginning.The POV writing style DOES NOT WORK if both characters have the exact same voice , attitude , style . And who are these characters ? Tobias and Tris are written so completely differently than the last books it was like reading a whole new series . I hated them in Allegiant , but only because I was already bought into the original characters the author sold me on in the last 2 books.Furthermore , the plot also slowed down with little to no suspense once they were 'outside the fence ' . Instead you get chapters of information dump so the author can try to fill in gaps and throw this plot together . YAWN ! I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through because I just could n't take it anymore . I heard the ending was no better than the beginning as all the bad guys win and the good guys for some reason get killed off . What a shame~ No wonder so many authors try to self publish when this is what the big publishing companies spend their money on .	-1
This author seems to be he 'll bent for destruction and misery . The few `` good '' moments are even clouded in fear or death . She writes well but way to dark and depressing . If your looking for a book with mostly violence , destruction , and misery this is your book .	-1
I debated how many stars to give this but decided that I felt strongly enough to give it just one . It 's not because of the ending . I had read about one-third of the way through when I decided to stop and put the book away . Part of it was reading the two alternating perspectives got a little confusing . Tris and Four never really had different voices so I sometimes had to check to see whose point of view I was reading . I decided to finish the book because I LOVED the first two so much . I now wish I had n't wasted my time . Once it 's read , it can never be unread ! I wondered as I read Allegiant if an editor ever came to Roth and said , `` You know , maybe you should think about going in a different direction . '' If that had happened , she should 've listened . But it 's apparent that for reasons I 'll never understand , she decided to write this mess . The dialog is stilted , Roth is n't good writing from different perspectives other than Tris ' , the characters never really developed and it seems like Roth did n't know what to do with some of the supporting characters so she either kills them off or they just sort of faded away and became irrelevant.And what happened to Four between the time she wrote Insurgent and Allegiant ? ? ? Did she suddenly start to hate him ? I never liked that his daddy and mommy issues were n't resolved during the first two books but they really make a difference in his thinking in Allegiant . Four used to be badass but in Allegiant , he became this whiney , angst filled , insecure boy/man whose parents did n't hug him enough . Sadly , his character devolved over time.I love Tris . I 'll always love Tris . I think Roth knows her best so if this is what she wanted to do to her beloved character , then it 's her choice . But I think Tris ' relationship with Four , despite the fact that she thinks she 's in love with him , just seemed too contrived and maybe Roth could n't write it any other way . The whole plot , the relationships that had been built over the first two books , just collapsed in this one.And frankly , with that ending , Roth pretty much guaranteed that I will never read this series again .	-1
I loved the first 2 books . I could n't put them down . I could barely get through this one . The story was repetitive and boring . I do n't know why Roth decided to take the book the way she did . All I can think is that the up coming movies swayed her decisions.My advice would be to read the first 2 and make up your own ending . This one will only disappoint you .	-1
Tris ' world has crumbled for various reasons . Now she has the opportunity to go outside the city 's boundaries to discover what 's beyond . However , what Tris and her friends discover may be something that is totally unexpected.My straightforward opinion of the final book was that it was the worst in the series . This series seemed to go downhill as the story went on . I only read this book because I really wanted to know how the trilogy ends . First of all I did not like the alternating point of views . Sometimes it makes the story better and sometimes it makes it more confusing . In this case it made the story more confusing . Second , I did not like Tobias in this book at all . He is a totally different person . In the first and second book there is great character development and then in the final book he is really different . Third , Tris and Tobias ' relationship seems to be one of the main problems in the book . They do n't seem to trust each other about anything and most of the time they are arguing . Lastly , it was very depressing . *SPOILER* I was crying while reading the last few chapters that were from Tobias ' POV . I have NEVER read a book in which the author has the main character killed . I mean seriously . The last few chapters were basically about how much Tobias missed Tris and how he was dealing with the situation.So my message to all of you who are reading this review is ... DO NOT READ ALLEGIANT ! You will be greatly disappointed .	-1
I really loved Divergent and Insurgent kept the series going for me . This book started out okay but once they got on the outside it just lost the tone of the series for me . It seems like it focused too much on Tris and Tobias fighting and making up and then rushed through the action , the parts that actual added to the story . Aside from the annoying back and forth between Know-it-all Tris and Stubborn-little-boy Tobias , you had the conflict of the situation in Chicago and then the new GP vs GD conflict . Neither of which really had a satisfying resolution . I mean Tris died to do the memory wipe but David as still in charge after that and what everyone was just magically living together in perfect GP/GD harmony ? I was disappointed that Tris died but I was more disappointed that she did n't die for a good enough reason . If Amar could get Tobias and Christina could get into the city so easily and inoculate certain people against the memory serum why did n't they just do that . And it seems like Nita and Matthew could have figured out long ago to use the memory serum on everyone . Nita had planned to use the death serum , Matthew was against that why would n't he have suggested the memory serum as a compromise . And if David was so suspicious of Tris hanging out with GD people why would he make her part of his council ? She came into the compound with her GD brother , best friend and boyfriend , she lived in the dorm with the same GD people the entire time and in the end her give away was she was spending too much time with GD people ? And then Tobias is able to end the entire conflict with the factionless by appealing to Evelyn 's motherly side . A mother who abandoned him , used him , spent most of her life planning this rebellion and just went okay I will give up ? And all the factionless who had been spit on their whole lives just went okay cool you have your son back let just forgive and forget . And the same thing with Marcus he starts to disagree with the compromise Evelyn sets up and the Joanna is just like no and he backs down . She threatens that she will expose him for refusing peaceful terms but why should that matter ? I mean why did n't everyone reject him when they found out about his abuse and Tobias . It does n't even make sense that Joanna would have accepted him as a leader for the Allegiant in the first place . It felt like it was all forced for the end when Tobias has to `` choose between his parents . '' And then Marcus just disappears . And I did n't really feel clear on the whole experiment . So when there was a large population of Divergent they were supposed to come out and do what exactly ? If they are trying to keep them in a controlled area until future generations are genetically repaired why leave so many GD on the outside , just to discriminate against them . The GP supposedly hated them and punished them to harshly while the GP got away with stuff . But when Tobias tried to help the rebels get ahold of the death serum they did n't really do anything to him . I did n't care for both perspectives . After the first two books it really messed with the flow of the series . Now I see the whole point was so Tris could be killed but it did n't feel like a natural progression of the series and aside from mentioning each others names it was easy to forget which person you were reading . Tobias 's perspective did n't add to the story it distracted from it . It felt like you were getting half a story from him and half a story from her , but since they were both doing such different things all the time you were never getting the full story . This whole book felt incomplete and forced . The resolutions were n't satisfying nor did they make sense for the series as a whole . The book was called Allegiant and so was the group that wanted factions back but the book did n't really have anything to with that . I would have called it Tangent because she started out telling the Divergent story but then got caught up in this other thing with genetic testing , and it got convoluted like she lost a clear vision for the story . The characters felt like pawns , like Roth had forgotten the passion with which she built these strong characters in the first two books . She was just having them do whatever she wanted whether it was fitting to their character or not . If you are going to kill such a strong character like Tris then the death should feel impactful and meaningful , hers did not . Peter could have died long ago , he did n't need to be in this book . Who cares if he gets to start over and try to be a good person ? So if you want to know what happens to the Chi town gang check it out at your library or borrow it from someone but do n't spend your money . It is n't worth it . I do n't even feel like it was worth the time I spent reading it .	-1
**Warning- spoiler alert**I stayed up until midnight finishing this book and ended up having the worst nights sleep I 've had in a long time . I feel like my best friend has just died . Which in fact she kind of did . I have been reading other reviews and there are two that I keep thinking of ... one that says something like , `` if you devoured the first two books of the trilogy and loved them as I did , stop there ! Do n't read the third one . Just make up your own ending . '' And the other is , `` does the author want to end her career ? '' I can honestly say that I feel pretty certain that I wo n't be following or supporting this author anymore.I think I would 've been able to accept the ending better if Tobias had been killed instead . As Tris is the main character of the book , I came to love and admire her . I identified with her . What will this book say to all the other girls who also identified with her ? Will they feel like they should sacrifice themselves also ? I hope not ! I was barely able to finish the last chapters and epilogue . Who wants to watch the man you loves trying to move on ? And to imagine who he might end up with ? Who will take Tris spot ? It was heart wrenching.Seriously , what a huge disappointment . Tris did deserve better and so did we . I reserved this book months ago , not caring how much I paid . And now I find myself thinking what a waste of money and I 'm so glad I only paid $ 7 .	-1
so disappointed that I had to wait a year for thisthere 's just so many things I did n't like about this book I do n't even know where to begin , first of all this book is told from Tobias and Tris points of view but I honestly did n't feel any difference , the main plot of the book which is that they get out of the city to find out they were just a governmentexperiment hugely disappointed me and kind of made me feel that the first two books were for nothing , and Tris dying was the final drop that made me lost my love for this trilogyI would have preferred the story to end on the second book : (	-1
It 's a shame this book ever made to the assembly line . Such a waste of good paper and storage space if you chose the digital version .	-1
I 'm completely shocked that this was the ending to this series . I loved the first two especially the love between four and tris it was exciting to see how they were so different but still loved one another thru it all . I can not believe tris died and it was just like well that 's it . All the bad people got off for all they done while in my opinion the best character who done as much as she could for the people dies . And a stupid death at that . She was finally happy to live and stopped going on suicide missions for the life and love she wanted . But guess what nope did n't happen all the bad people got the life she help create but she got nothing . I love romance stories but I also love action.. if your going to bring a romance into a book so strongly than do n't disappoint . Just really feel like blah over the ending just horrible ! ! ! !	-1
They tried to take two separate story lines and combine it into one story , and it did not work . Although it explained the reasoning behind the first two books , it still had a poor and weak ending , a poor and aimless story line . I felt the book was only written to fulfill a contract allowing the author to collect a pay check .	-1
1st if you have read the reviews I gave the other 2 books , this will come as no surprise . In my thoughts the second and third books could have been cut down and combined . In the authors attempts to be cutting edge and daring with this book , it fell flat and lets say the last few chapters served no purpose . The fate of the couple through out the books was not served in this final one and the out come was poorly put together . The author in the attempt to make a & # 34 ; super/hero cutting edge root for them couple & # 34 ; made Tris even more useless/whinny and Tobias boardline a waste . I had hopes that the author would bounce this book back into a more reader friendly realm ... . I was wrong ... I just got more and more confused on who was the good guys and who was the bad guys and to be honest I just wanted the book to end and be over . If you want a kick in the seat pants & # 34 ; super/hero cutting edge root for them couple & # 34 ; read The Hunger Games books ... .. I would never read this author again	-1
I was expecting to be regaled with stories of pregnancies and births . Instead Ms Fairley writes about her schooling and her marriage . Yes , to be fair there are some incidents of midwifery , but the few there are leave you wanting more , and the author does not deliver ( pun intended ) .	-1
Finally , the fairly readable , but unrealistic plots from this series is wrapped up once and for all . I got the feeling that Dean Koontz was never really into this series and was happy to wrap it up . I do n't blame him.Victor Immaculate 's desire to end all of life did n't seem realistic and his arrogance made it clear from the beginning that he was going to fail . Even though the readers will know that Dean Koontz wo n't have the bad guy win , there should be some kind of suspense . I would have also liked if there was some kind of plausibility , but I 've given up at that possibility since book 1 .	-1
I love Arya , I love Tyrion , I love Jon , I love Dany . They are my friends and my heroes , I want to know what happens with them and I want to see them have a fate that is unlike all the other main characters that have died so far.Instead of finding out about my friends , I get this steaming pile of paper which is about none of them . This book is misery tourism : a bunch of miserable characters with screwed up minds riding through a ravaged miserable land filled with miserable people . There are no real redeeming features here other than finding out how wretched all the supporting characters from the previous three books were . There is so little plot advancement that this book should never have been written . Just like the movie Signs , this is a perfect example as to why so few successful stories are based around secondary characters who have no real role to play in the events unfolding around them : it 's BORING.I 'm good at sticking with books , but I could n't even bring myself to finish this thing . And after the little research I 've done to see what it is I 'm still missing , I wo n't .	-1
I 'll keep it short ... while you will wade through it , waiting for ANYthing , book 4 pretty much sucked . Did n't stop me from buying book 5 . Even with the apologia at the end of 4 , it was still not a very good book . Book 5 is getting back to speed ... we 'll see ... it 's getting back to the characters I want to know about ( tho , C1 totally baffled me ) . Oh . I 'm a Tyrion fan .	-1
Reading this book was a vast disappointment after book 3 . It seems Martin may have peaked early in this series . I found that I had to force myself to continue reading to finish this book . Not very much action and the continuity is totally absent due to the changing perspectives of unsympathetic characters . Book 4 offers all the excitement of watching a bag of popcorn in the microwave , with the caveat that all the corn has popped in volume 3 . You keep waiting and waiting for something to catch fire , but alas there is not even any smoke .	-1
I have read the three books prior to this one and found them all quite compelling . I love the HBO series and find the books even better , very difficult to put down . The 4th however I have put down so many times I am finding it arduous to read on . Hopefully HBO will continue with the series and just skip over this book entirely.Also , the Kindle version is horrid ! ! ! There are SO many misspellings at times it is difficult to figure out what the word is even supposed to be . They ca n't even spell the author 's name correctly let alone the name of the book ! `` A Fr.Asi i OR CROWS '' is how it 's written at one point . Spell check would be an asset to whoever transcribed this . Buyer beware , just go to the library for this one or borrow it from a friend . DO NOT get the Kindle version . It makes it even more difficult to get through the book.I am looking forward to `` Dancing With Dragons '' and praying Mr. Martin has gone back to his original way of writing . If not it would do well if someone else finished the series .	-1
I was disappointed in this book after another reviewer compared the author to Dan Brown and Steig Larson . The author is not even close to having the skill of either of those writers.This author was heavy handed and crude when it came to the budding romance between the two main characters . ( I use the term romance tongue in cheek . ) The author created a female character , Kate , who was a man 's version of how they would like to see woman behave . Kate was crude and overtly sexual one minute and whinny and simpering , the next . She was more than ready to dump her son and jump the hero despite knowing that an ex-husband with a explosive temper was probably close on her heels and would do anything to retrieve the boy as a matter of pride rather than attachment . The Hero was flawed ... to say the least . He was created with a little too much clich & eacute ; paint . As for the bad guys they were all overdone and way too bad . Please , force a youth to eat a cell phone because you hate his ring tone ... .hmmm.Now what was good , there were few typos in the book itself and the author had a good story that was well written as far as logic of the overall sequence of events . This author has a good grasp of language and is skilled in developing the suspense sequences . I think when the author learns to temper his characters with subtlety he will be a writer worth reading .	-1
I found this book to be very difficult to read , and more about the literature than about the lives of the women involved . The overblown prose and flowery language were difficult to decipher , and I fought to stay awake more than once . I had trouble finishing it , and never reached the point where the effort paid off in lessons learned or insights gained .	-1
I originally selected this book because it was on the bestseller list . However , I quickly learned that every book on the bestseller list is not a good book . Despite a compulsion to give each book that I choose to read a fair chance and to make a serious attempt to complete each one ( even non-fiction books , which I believe are often very dense ) , I found it extremely difficult to work my way through this book . In addition to the author 's repetitiveness , poor and/or irrelevant use of imagery , and under-development of the books `` characters '' , the book seemed to be more of a homage to Nabokov than a memoir of exploring the liberating powers of literature in a hostile environment . Unfortunately , I was able to realize this by page 48 , which is where I stopped reading .	-1
I was expecting details about the authors life in post revolutionary Iran and insight into women 's lives there . This is not a memoir its really more of a very long essay comparing disjointed aspects of life to a few books.It only made me want to find a copy of Lolita . It got very boring and I am sad to say I put it down and did n't want to go near it again.I agree with the other one and two star reviews that the book is short on insight into the personal relationships ( which I craved ) and gets repetitive . I only need to read the same comparison once or twice in the same chapter ! She also keeps repeating that she is n't comparing Humbert with Iran ... but is n't she ? I suspect in our post 9/11 zeal to embrace insight into from Muslim culture this book was placed on a high pedestal it honestly did not deserve . Sad , as I am sure there are other more deserving authors out there .	-1
The `` hen '' looks like a rooster . I think that would be confusing to three or four year old children who have seen animal pictures in other books .	-1
SPOILER ALERT : you tell me i 'm gon na read a story about a drunk american soldier ( who for some reason fights w/ the italian army ) who shoots a guy in the back , knocks up a british nurse , who goes AWOL and ends up losing his preg girl AND the kid - and 99 out of 100 people will say `` no thanks '' . tell them its hemingway , all of a sudden it 's a `` classic '' . EXACTLY what happened to me - this was terrible , and you know what , some times 80 year old works that were great when written just do n't hold up , put this one in that category . pass .	-1
He does a good job of complicating the obvious . I could n't hold my attention span on this book , I mean the way he fluffs out even the simplist of common knowledge . It would of been a good book or guide if Harry could of simplified his explanations instead of taking what could be explained in one paragraph and making it half a chapter to a chapter long . I want my money back .	-1
THis is one of the worst books I have ever read . Not sure if I will ever read any other of her books .	-1
Okay , first off , I think that Ayn Rand is probably the most overrated writer in history . While this may be her best novel , ( Atlas is one of the most boring piece of trash ever , Anthem is just unmoving , and We the Living is the worst thing I 've ever read ) that is n't saying much . Howard Roarke is , like every other Rand character , a poorly characterized superman who is never wrong and has no flaws at all . This is Rand 's biggest flaw in all of her work , her hero 's have no flaws and her antagonists have no good qualities . She tries very hard to make a romance out of this work but fails miserably . None of her characters have the depth required to make a believable romance , it 's like two cardboard cutouts meeting and falling in love for some reason . Perhaps the only good thing about this giantic failure that is somehow considered to be a classic by certain people , is that it stresses the importance of individuality ( a quality many Objectivists lack as they cling to Rand 's image like little leeches ) but other than that there is nothing to this novel . It struggles very hard to be great , you can almost hear it 's little flippers slapping the cement floor of greatness , but it never quite makes it to the pool . It 's boring , overlong with stretches of scenes that have no importance , and there are basically three characters : her supermen , the lovestruck woman , and everyone else . It 's not as important as people want you to believe , go against the grain and do n't read it . Get some Kafka instead .	-1
Shorter Ayn Rand : A combination of greed and cruelty will get you more power , sex and money than either greed or cruelty alone.It 's a crummy novel , too . When I was in college , long ago , the architecture students used to arrange a showing of the movie version once a year , at which they would jeer and hoot and holler not unlike the way a later generation behaved at 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show . '	-1
Such a boring cookbook ! ! I like color and pictures to give a hint as to what to expect from a cookbook . This one has sparse skethings of a shallot or some other food . Although it has good info describing the numerous fruits and veggies out there , it was n't worth the money . And all the recipes I have tried so far have been bland ! Stick with a Betty Crocker for a basic cookbook .	-1
Though interested in MM I did n't realize how deeply I was going to be taken by this book . If I had , I probably would n't have bought it .	-1
This book tried to be politically correct , but fails because the whole premise was seen from Iggie 's perspective . I would have loved to see the point of view from the Garbers ; what were they thinking and feeling , and even if they wanted help or not from the so called `` caring '' neighbors .	-1
California Pizza Kitchen is known as a good restaurant that makes bad pizza . They have essentially removed the pizza flavor from pizza , which makes the product a tasteless dough and cheese platform for toppings . The result can be a nice meal if the toppings are good , but it does not taste even remotely like pizza . It 's extremely misleading and disappointing that they use `` pizza '' in the name . It 's nice that we live in an era where you can find good pizza in most major metropolitan areas these days , so you are not stuck with this stuff when you want real pizza .	-1
If you are looking for traditional tamale recipes DO NOT BUY this book .	-1
For all the time and energy the authors expended on this silly book , you would think it would have been better , and surely there are other subjects out there that are more worthy of an in-depth investigation like this is purported to be . There is no riddle to this story . Simpson 's guilt is obvious . And how does one know this ? The answer is simple , and it 's a little word called DNA . It proved Simpson 's guilt beyond a shadow of a doubt , but for some incomprehensible reason those who stubbornly cling to the ridiculous notion of Simpson 's innocence continue to ignore this fact . DNA and other forensic evidence does n't lie , exaggerate , or embellish . But people can and do .	-1
Way too little information for such thick book ! ( but good info on sewing knitted piece though.. even though it 's only on 2-3 pages of the book . )	-1
I have tried a half dozen recipes from this book so far and I 've liked only one of them ( Sally Lunn ) . The pictures are beautiful , the spiral binding is great but the recipes I 've tried are mediocre . Maybe it 's just me or my machine ( Breadman ) , but recipes from my other cookbooks tend to taste better .	-1
I bought this book years ago and finally got around to reading it about six months ago . Even with as little as I knew about the Catholic faith , I knew something was off . Finally I saw so many contradictions between what I was learning from it and what I was learning from real Catholic sources that I tired of it and the simplistic way it talked down to the reader and put it down . It now holds up a wobbly end of a table , that 's how little I think of it . I 'm just glad to find some practical use of it.Do yourself a Big favor and get Catholicism for Dummies by Father John Trigilio and Father Kenneth Brighenti instead of this , it was extremely well written and very , very useful , I 'm way ahead of the game in my RCIA classes now .	-1
I think that one problem with this book is that it forces outcomes on people and reduces choice . For instance , the entire discussion of drinking . Yes , there are some people who will need to never drink again , because they are `` true alcoholics '' . But for a majority of problem drinkers , total abstinence is not required ( unlike hard drugs or smoking , where no real reason to continue , for example , based on health could be made , with drinking alcohol , especially red wine , real health benefits can be seen , and people in my view should have the option of having a beer or two or wine or two in a social setting , rather than being forced into lifelong , total abstinence from a drink that can save you from a heart attack ) .She thus forces this outcome of total abstinence on everyone . I dislike this because it reduces choice . For instance , if you go to a hynotherapist in Britain , Canada , or Europe or Australia , moderation will be one potential outcome that you are given . The author falls into the trap typical of U.S. therapists , of thinking that only 12-step programs can work for people with alcohol problems . Whereas , even in the U.S. , this view is being rejected . I think that the book is ok , but I would like to see this dogma removed in future .	-1
Ideological certitude and its bastard cousin `` the true believer '' have taken this country to places it should not have gone in the last decade . We have fallen far from the Greek ethos of `` white pebble , black pebble '' on true democratic principles . When western democracies are goaded , bullied , beguiled and cajoled into wars that are still reverberating to this day , we are allowing elected officials the decisions of kings.Until we can vote on consensual bloodletting there is no liberal democracy . We have not come very far in the last 1000 years at all.This book and its central tenet are fraudulent .	-1
Perhaps the author contributes to the view that the economists are not serious scientists . For example , he mentions that unemployment is good for the society . I 'm sure that the people who were unemployed in the midst of the Great Depression would tell you otherwise , and many millions who are currently unemployed now . The only point that I could possibly agree on was that recycling paper might reduce demand for trees and we may have less trees planted as a result . Other than that , I could n't find much economic insight in this book . The author seems to be more frustrated by the fact that economics is not a science on par with physics and chemistry , but that 's the nature of economics . One can not predict the economic future as one would predict physical motion using Newton mechanics . That does not mean that law of economics does not work . It is a rough science and you would have to make intelligent guesses based on common sense and clear evidence . Either way , disappointing book .	-1
Reeves certainly has the background to write a Kennedy book . In fact , Paul Johnson quoted Reeves extensively in his American history book to help slam JFK . However , I 've read enough books about the 35th President to spot numerous half-truths , distortions and pure guessing passed off as reliable sources . Shame on you , Reeves . Although I read the entire book , and did give it a chance , it 's an anti-JFK book from the start . If you want a well-done , fair critique on JFK , read Richard Reeves ' Profile of Power . Much more objective ...	-1
Very wordy ! ! The examples provided are weak ( and not many ) . The problems at the end of each section does n't always match what he 's taught in that section . Endless frustration .	-1
It 's old and does n't explain much of anything .	-1
Whenever I get this impression of a book 1/3 of the way through it I check others reviews and find quite a few with similar feelings . I thought I was reading Danielle Steele , who I have given up on because of her repetitious driving of her point across . So they are living with a lot of angst , get on with it . Should she try to save Beth , cause she could n't save Glenda ? Will Nick turn out to be another guy to do her wrong even if she feels such a strong attraction to him ? Can he ever forgive himself for not making Alyssa wear her helmet . Stay tuned for the next chapter in this soap saga . No one wants to tell anyone anything but they are all sure trying to find out everyone 's secrets . That 's a small town for you , you can never outrun your past .	-1
The Cynster series started strongly , and I look forward to each new book . But this book is the end of the line for me , and hopefully for the author as well.The novel just was n't very interesting , and while the sex scenes are certainly sexy - they 're also very repetitive . After the first couple I just skimmed them to see if they ever advanced the plot , which they didn't.I think that Stephanie Laurens has fallen into the trap of liking her own characters so much that she thinks her readers will want to keep reading to see what happens to them . She does n't seem to put the same effort into actually making the books good , as though we 'll be content to just know that now both the twins are happy . ( She 's not the only one who falls into this trap as witnessed by the latest Kleypas novel , Lady Sophia 's Lover . ) In short , I 'd skip this book if you 're a longtime fan , and buy some of her earlier novels if you are n't .	-1
From one of the greatest writers in Boston ... Dennis , I 'm not too happy about this one . Can you write another for the men in the boiler rooms ?	-1
Started out great , but fizzled into a typical 3rd rate suspense yarn . I think this book has put me over the edge . I 'm giving up reading books of this kind and will do more research on who is writing better stories that do n't let me down at the end .	-1
A friend , knowing my interest in America 's Presidents , brought me a copy of page 64 , thinking I would be interested in it . I was . . . in all of the errors ! I found at least 7 errors of fact on that one page about Vice-President Wheeler . I know nothing of the rest of the book , and hope this is definitely advertised as fiction . Even so , I would think a little more attention to historical facts would be worth the author 's time.Del Hambley	-1
Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite authors . Unfortunately , he has a little problem ; he 's got a successful career in multiple mediums , winning awards and selling millions of copies of his novels , comics , and now films . This has led to the translation of EVERY work of his having a planned adaptation into other mediums . Neverwhere was a nice little low-budget BBC miniseries , and it worked well as that . It was basically Sandman-lite , but it had its charm . Now , since Gaiman has proved himself as a competent author of comics , novels , and scripts , it also HAS to be a book and a comic series . Similarly , Stardust was a nice novel , and it got a great movie . Now , there is a comic adaptation on the way , even though it was already an illustrated novel . WHY ? Encouraging his behavior by buying it in multiple forms is going to kill Gaiman artistically : rather than coming up with new material , we will be flooded with translations of the same old work over and over again . Case-in-point : his failed script for a children 's cartoon series , Interworld , was published as a half-baked 180-page children 's novel , with poor grammar and poor editing , in hardback for $ 14 . Luckily , I borrowed it from a friend , because had I bought it , I would be infuriated.Do n't humor Gaiman in his artistic constipation ; he 's a GREAT author . Sandman , Mirrormask , Good Omens , these are TRUE CLASSICS of their genres , and the man has the potential to change film , comics and literature , if he only continues to create original content . If we allow him to coast in his career by simply cashing in on his already made franchises , he will fail to make an impact . True fans of Gaiman , stay away from this , and all other remakes of his work .	-1
Dr Atkins spends entirely too much time telling the reader how great and wonderful he is . That is n't really why we purchased his book . He could have gotten his message across with far fewer words if he was n't so terribly proud of himself ! We , both my wife and myself feel cheated by him .	-1
I have never understood why Norman Cantor seems to think the public only wants the `` movie version '' of history instead of the real thing . But the movie version -- including outdated ideas , sensational assertions and gross misunderstandings -- is what this is . After reading this book -- which , fortunately , I did n't pay full price for -- I am happy to see from the reviews posted here that others have spotted its many flaws.Quite a few people who come to this book WITHOUT much background in medieval history or medicine find it fascinating , and feel they have learned a lot about history from it -- though admittedly it 's also rambling , repetitious , VERY poorly edited and sometimes difficult to keep track of . ( I 'll second all those criticisms but wo n't address them here . ) On the other hand , people who actually KNOW something about biology , anthropology , genetics , epidemiology , demographics or material culture will be brought up short by Cantor 's sloppy thinking and downright inexcusable ignorance.One reviewer comments , `` Cantor 's research for this tome must have been incredibly extensive , since he provides excruciating details for every topic ... '' But in fact , it 's those very fascinating details that are often wrong . Just about any time I found myself saying `` Wow , I never knew THAT , '' it turned out later that Cantor was wrong . For instance , he clearly did n't even bother to verify his facts on the old `` Ring Around the Rosy '' legend -- check it out on the Urban Legends Reference Pages ; the song seems to hve come into existence in the 1880s.As for demographics , he confuses the statistics on life expectancy badly , saying that a modern actuary would have given the 15-year-old Princess Joan `` just about ten years to live '' , based on an *average* life expectancy of 25 . This is highly misleading , because the highest death rates were among children under 5 -- if you made it to age 20 ( only about two-thirds of the children born actually did ) , you could expect to live at least into your 50s , even under the appalling sanitary conditions of the time . And Joan was a princess . relatively well cared for and well nourished , and might have lived even longer . King Edward I lived to be 68 ; Eleanor of Aquitaine ( 1122-1204 ) lived to be 82.He also asserts that men might be on their third or fourth marriage by age 45 , ignoring the fact that women of that age might almost equally well be on their third or fourth husband . The tendency for women to die in childbirth is nearly balanced by men 's tendency to die in wars , brawls , or hunting accidents.His carelessness about material culture is at least as great . He perpetuates the myth of the Great Unwashed by asserting that people did n't `` bathe '' -- they may well not have immersed themselves completely in water , but at least the upper and middle classes washed their bodies regularly ( a sponge bath and a good rinse ) , changed their underwear frequently , and swept their floors daily . He regularly gets clothes wrong : women did not wear `` corsets '' in the 1300s , and also a velvet altar frontal is not a `` vestment , '' nor would it be used ON the altar . ( Vestments are clothing , cloths ON the altar are always linen . ) The real problem , though , is that Cantor apparently has n't figured out how to write competently for a lay audience . He seems to think the public only wants the `` movie version '' of history . I 've read several of his other books , and his textbooks -- where he 's not trying to be breezy or topical , or to air his sometimes crochety opinions of modern life -- are fine . His _Medieval Lives_ , on the other hand , is terrible : it 's at least as sloppy and filled with errors as this is . The worst parts are where he 's trying to be funny.I read William Manchester 's _A World Lit Only by Fire_ perhaps seven or eight years ago , when I knew less than I do now , and found I think nine errors of fact in its first dozen pages . And I do n't have a PhD , just a good liberal arts college degree . In a morbid way , it 's amusing to hear THAT book praised as better than this one . Perhaps that IS an accurate assessment .	-1
I have had a lot of problems with the audio in this book . It has n't recognized what page you are on or when you turn pages .	-1
1 . The title `` Sea Hunter '' is weak and misleading.2 . The cover picture is also weak and misleading.3 . The story idea is creative.4 . The majority of the book ( sans the last 18 pages ; the ending ) is interestingly detailed and well written , so as to make the story captivating . The story builds up well to an interesting climax.5 . The ending ( i.e. , 18 pages ) is largely disappointing , rushed , and weak . It 's as though the writer suddenly reached a maximum page length or deadline and rushed to write the ending . The story details drop noticeably to a substantive low , leaving readers with many loose ends , particularly as relating to the creature and the villains . Essentially , the ending is poorly contrived and written.In summary , its a fun read until the ending , which rapidly deflates to a weak ending.Two stars because the writer wrote well until the ending and then wasted his and my time with a weak ending .	-1
As a designer myself ( in metro LA ) , I bought this book as I buy many decorating books to share with my clients . I look at the books with some of my clients as a way of learning their likes and dislikes . It 's interesting for me to observe that the people I 've been working with almost immediately set this book aside after they begin to go through it and they grab for other books that may fit their likes more closely . Maybe the feel of the rooms in this book reflect a regional or city preference . I can not help but agree with my customers who think these rooms are n't relaxed enough for modern life .	-1
What were they thinking ? Whoever put this book together does n't have a clue about creating luxurious , livable spaces . This book is a turnoff . I 'd call this funeral home or hotel lobby design or designing to impress the ladies who lunch crowd . This book is obviously about how to spend a fortune in the process , too . Real luxury is about comfort and unpretentious ease , not necessarily money . Unfortunately , this designer does not seem to get that .	-1
This was one of those books that fizzled out causing me to feel I wasted my time . By the end , I could not care less what happened to whom or why .	-1
The only reason I finished this book is that it was the only reading material i had while on vacation . It was awful . The repetitive `` they hated eachother but there was such chemistry '' thing got old by the end of the first chapter -- and was repeated , ad nauseum , throughout the rest of the book ( and quite nearly on every single insufferable page ) . Skip this and instead read ANYTHING by Marian Keyes ; all of her books are the perfect Chick Lit -- especially `` Watermelon . ''	-1
I have to be honest - I really wanted to like this book after reading the reviews , but her use of appositive phrases is extremely overdone and very annoying . Maybe it 's just a personal pet peeve since I am an English teacher , but she interrupts almost every sentence with a thought interjected into the middle - ugh ... .a good technique but not for almost every line ! It makes her sentences jilted and slows the flow of the reading ... I had to abandon it . I 'm sure the plot is solid , but to be considered a sophisticated writer , you need to have more than one trick in your bag concerning style .	-1
The only reason I gave this book one star was because it is the lowest rating available . Amazon should permit negative ratings , especially for a Patrick Robinson book.This absurd story begins with the sudden `` flipping '' of an experienced British commando during a firefight who suddenly `` sees the light '' and is now an anglo-hating terrorist . More ridiculous is that England , the commando 's own country can not seem to locate him but the U.S. quickly starts following his trail ; one of many overt political statements from Mr. Robinson.The author adds an even `` more realistic '' scenario . A maximum-security Israeli prison housing some of the world 's most dangerous terrorists manned by a few poorly trained guards is easily overrun.Next a Russian submarine sitting in drydock for several years is suddenly thrust into service and manned by foreign nationals not exactly known for their naval ability . The sub , manned by a skeleton crew , evades all detection by the most technologically advanced country in the world . Quite realistic . Even better , after sitting in drydock for lack of money for so long , this submarine never ever has one mechanical breakdown ? This is just the beginning of the book 's many insults to the readers ' intelligence.Throughout this ridiculous story are constant overt political opinions by Mr. Robinson who uses his books as his own political soapbox from which to preach his ultra-conservative `` Might makes Right '' declaration . The story 's liberal characters are inserted merely as punching bags for the author 's infallible conservativism.Mr . Robinson 's political tirades are at best ... juvenile.I had found Mr. Robinson 's earlier works- Kilo Class , Nimitz Class , HMS Unseen and The Shark Mutiny more researched and less implausible but his works deteriorated with each subsequent novel.Root canal is less painful than reading this book.If you want to read good submarine techno-thrillers try Joe Buff or Michael Dimercurio	-1
What a dissapointment , coming after his great debut , THE PERFECT STORM . THis is a loose collection of magazine articles published previously by the author , without even new research ... Maybe his editor wanted to cash in as fas as possible in the wake of PERFECT STORM 's success , adn JUnger had not the time to come up with something new and really good . So , he got his scrap book , and thcam tcham ! ! This book was born !	-1
THE STORIES IN THIS AUDIO VERSION ARE GREAT . I DO RECOMMEND THAT YOU `` READ '' THE BOOK AND NOT LISTEN TO THE AUDIO.MS . ROBERTS HAS A VOICE THAT IS AKIN TO CHALK ON A BLACKBOARD . IT IS SO GRATING AND DISTRACTING THAT IT RUINS THE STORIES.I GOT RID OF THE AUDIO AND CHECKED OUT THE BOOK FROM THE LIBRARY.I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY ANYTHING THAT SHE MIGHT NARRATE .	-1
After having read `` The other side of the story '' , which was complex and multidimensional , I assumed all the other books by this author would be similar . Unfortunately , this one was the opposite - very predictable and boring . And the main character was too neurotic for my taste . I still liked the writing style , that 's the only reason I finished the book .	-1
I am shocked . I went to the bookstore to find some books in sign language for my preschool students who were deaf . I was thrilled to find the titles , then livid with rage at what I found between the covers . These are not true signs . These are n't even invented signs , these are gestures and body language . I am iffy about teaching hearing babies sign anyway , does n't seem to be a need for it . But if you are going to write a book about using signs with infants , at least have the decency to use actual true signs that are used by the Deaf community . What you have here is an insult to them , as well as a lie to the customers who buy your book thinking they are teaching their children sign . Instead , they are teaching pantomime .	-1
Madelaine de Lacy , Duchess of Magnus has swapped places with her cousin Eleanor to be a lady 's companion so that she can attend the Game of the Century to stop her father from gambling away the family 's heirloom , the Queen 's tiara . On arrival at Chalice Hall , she meets Gabriel Ansell , Lord Campion , the fiance that she deserted 4 years ago . Will Madelaine resist the charms of Gabriel and will they trust each other enough to stop the scam that is the Game of the Century ? This is my second book by Christina Dodd and will probably be my last . I had trouble finishing the book and alsmost gave up half way through . The danger lurking in the background did n't really get off to a start and you could predict the ending . There was no chemistry between Gabriel and Madelaine except for one sex scene which was quite hot . Apart from this scene give the book a miss and read a book by other historical romantic authors who do a much better job.Lealing	-1
this kind of story line ( us vs russia ) and charachter development ( the main charachters are the weapons and weapons systems ) went out of fashion 15 years ago . this book is boring , the plot ridiculous , the authenticity incredulous - in short , I might read this book if the cable was out , it was raining , i had run out of wine , the cd player was broken , and it was the only book on the shelf .	-1
After attending my first NASCAR race ( Talladega ) , I wanted to learn more about the entire NASCAR experience -- the race and RV'ing extravaganza . However , this book drags on forever.If you 've never been to a NASCAR race , go . If you 've been to one , you certainly do not need to read this book .	-1
Stories of the rich and famous ( mostly the rich ) who were hit during their richness with a disease , usually a serious disease.Cavuto speaks lovingly of them , hard to say whether it was because they were rich and successful or because they did n't go into a tailspin when bad news hit . No great insight , however , comes from his reviews , or interviews , or analysis . The possibilities were there but the book fell short . Sadly , so many people do good things AFTER they are hit by MS or their child is hit by a drunk . Not to minimize their good deeds , but motivation is easier than it would be for Joe Schmoe who simply feels the need to aid the Lepers or feed the hungry or get rapists off the street . While these people took action , it took personal loss to get them off their seats , and as I said , admirable , but motivated by self . Some of what I read between Cavuto 's lines is the shock that this could happen to rich people- duh- it happens to all of us and most of us do n't have the means to do things about it .	-1
I really love chick lit , and found this to be one of the most boring , going nowhere stories I have read in a long time ... I never enjoyed the story , it was too long with pointless details and I found it real easy to put down . Definitely would NOT recommend ! !	-1
For Hannah Lovekin , life 's been going fairly well , when her boyfriend of 5 years , Jason , goes and ruins everything by proposing . Hannah , embittered by her first marriage , says no , only to change her mind after Jason promptly becomes engaged to someone else . Jason agrees to take her back , but only after she fulfills a list of requirements including confronting her ex-husband , Jack . Eventually , the we find that Hannah 's true issues with commitment ( hence the title ) lay not with her first husband , but with her relationship with her parents.As you can tell from the stars , this book did n't impress me much . While Hannah , the commitment phobic main character , did score a few points with her sardonic wit , overall , I did n't find her particularly likable . And I never understood why Jason , initally drawn as a nice , down-to-earth kind of guy , would have so quickly begun to see someone else after the inital break up . Also , as has happened before with Anna Maxted 's books , ( particularly Running In Heels ) the whole plot is tied up a little too neatly in the end . Maxted would like me to believe that Hannah 's issues , which have been generating for 30 years , took , oh , about a month to resolve so that Hannah could be happy ever after . Sorry , did n't buy it.You know it 's a problem when books from this genre ( generally designed to be quick , fun reads to make you smile in recognition and/or laugh out loud ) take weeks to read because , although you 're a fast reader , you 're just not that engrossed in the novel.Right after I finished this book , I started reading another chic book , `` Something Borrowed '' by Emily Giffin . I read it quickly , only putting it down when I had to go to work or sleep ( damn this needing-to-earn-a-living thing ! ) . Which makes `` Being Committed '' that much more disappointing .	-1
the author obviously did extensive research into this true story of murder in Tonga in 1976 , but he appeared to have felt compelled to include every detail anyone ever told him , including hundreds of details that are completely and totally irrelevant to the story . it is difficult to imagine that this book had an editor of any skill . the author 's `` style '' was extremely annoying , and i finished the book wishing that a better journalist had undertaken this effort .	-1
Decent sci-fi escapist fiction by Garth Nix . Familiar enough futuristic world , predictable story but well-written and entertaining . Might be worth a look for fans of Nix or the genre.Full review here : [ ... ]	-1
I used to enjoy reading a Jill Churchill book . This one is just awful . The plot is weak , the characters boring , writing stilted ... and the mystery was n't very mysterious . The touches that were probably meant to add reality felt more like bizarre twists being forced in.Mel , the dapper and intelligent detective , is much too worldly to be saddled with this : '' Mel was glad it was dark in the car . He was desperately afraid he might -- heaven forfend - be blushing. '' Seriously ? Forfend ? Blushing ? Who are you and what have you done with the funny , bright author we used to like ?	-1
I only read this book because the movie is coming out & I had n't read it in school . I really hated it ... ..it was impossible to understand most of the time & really boring . I hope the movie is better or it will be a total flop ... ..mad I spent $ 8 on it .	-1
If you 're thinking of buying the Great Gatsby ( a classic example of the literature elite trying to cram a book down the people 's mouths as a & quot ; classic & quot ; ) , read the yellow pages instead . It is that moving.With so many truly great books out there ( anything by Vonnegut , Catcher in the Rye , anything by Voltaire , etc . ) , why waste your time on this ?	-1
I always can find something good about a book , no matter how bad it is . The Great Gatsby , however , is probably one of the only books I 've read that I hate.It is the story of a man who , basically , talks about nothing . The plot is nonexistent , just the ramblings of a man who 's confused about society . The characters are either boring or not developed enough . The worst part about the book is that you get the feeling that F. Scott Fitzgerald is going to hit you with a great , dramatic , thought-provoking ending , and nothing happens at the end . When I finished , I was left with the feeling of & quot ; Okay , what was that all about ? & quot ; I can understand that it is a reflection of the 1920s , but certainly not a very good reflection.This is a book you should read when there is absolutely nothing else to read . If there is anything else at all , read that instead .	-1
I have had both rewarding and unrewarding experiences with classic literature . The Great Gatsby is certainly nothing I would have finished had it not been so short.My basic response to this book : It lacks depth of any significance . The descriptions are minimally imaginative , and never spark excitement . And the characters ? The characterizations , the portrayal of the characters and their actions and emotions , are all simple and do n't transmit any of the passion they are supposedly feeling . Supposedly , for example , the several main characters in the book , most notably Gatsby , have the Chalice of Life just at their fingertips , but are afraid to grasp it . But I got no feel for the inner anguish and turmoil and tortuous yearning that must arise from such fear and self-denial.In short , this book , while having a decent plot and overall structure , was boring , because the writing is boring . If The Great Gatsby was a serious attempt at good writing , then it is evident to me that Scott Fitzgerald had never in his his life experienced any significant passion or the thrill and thunderburst excitement that is the reward of spirited creativity .	-1
The following is a cut-up of other one-star reviews of this product.Exciting needs to stretch the mind . Mass-produced tickertape parade of sleeping pills . It needs to use sci-fi interest . Imagination murder is what makes the mind . A man spliced together out of old newsreels . 1920s self pity is a wonderful thing . View love in a distant manner .	-1
I heard this book was a classic , a must read , so I read it.It was a bad book ! I do n't think anyone would have published it today.I am not so young as to not understand a & quot ; great & quot ; novel , so I must say & quot ; this is one of the most boring and shallow books ever written & quot ; .I 'll give him one thing-this boredom is beautifuly written.His language is beautiful and captures the mood of the time and place , but it does n't make up for the complete lack of plot.I read , and read , and read and nothing happened.He had a good idea , Scott Fitzgerald but he did n't do much with it.I have noticed that readers do n't like the bad reviews.I suspect they think such reviews are not serious , but please listen to me-IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS BOOK PLEASE DO ! There are too many great and good books , there is too little time to read them , so do n't waste your time !	-1
I wanted to like this book.The main problem for me was that this book had no discernible plot . It was just Carkeet moving from one quirky player 's problems to another quirky player 's problems . I only read until page 50 , and the book 's plot had not start moving at that point . Not a good sign.I also did n't like the tone of the writing . Carkeet seems very taken by his quirky style and cleverness . It overwhelms the book , and is ultimately what keeps the plot bogged down in minutiae.Perhaps his existing fans will like this book , but I found it boring and unenjoyable .	-1
I do n't mind authors telling similar stories if each is entertaining in its own way . But this book troubled me . It had too many parts directly copied from LM Montgomery 's book The Blue Castle ( TBC ) . TBC was published in 1926 . This book was published in 1987 . I gave TBC 4 stars.PLOT PROBLEMS : Missy is 33 , wimpy , mousy , downtrodden , a spinster , and lives with her mother . In TBC a doctor sends her a letter by mistake saying she will die within the year . Therefore , she no longer cares what people think , she speaks the truth even when it 's rude , and she makes major changes in her life . In this book , there is no doctor 's letter to her . She just all of a sudden makes changes in her life . Supposedly she met someone who encouraged her to do new things . I do n't think that person was enough to justify Missy 's changes.At the end of the book one character who had a significant part disappears - because she is really just a ghost . That came from nowhere . The ghost element did not connect in any logical way.CAUTION SPOILERS : In both books Missy proposes marriage to a stranger and tells him it is temporary because she will die within the year . In TBC Missy believes it . In this book she lies to him on purpose . At the end of this book she intends to continue the lie . That did n't feel right . It left the story unfinished.I was also disappointed in the lack of relationship development . In TBC there was a lengthy period of the couple interacting and getting to know each other . Here there is nothing like that . For some unknown reason he accepts her proposal . He discovers he likes sex with her . Then the book is over ( as far as their relationship goes ) .DATA : Narrative mode : 3rd person . Story length : 177 pages . Swearing language : none , other than occasional use of religious swear words . Sexual language : none . One sex scene referred to , no details . Setting : around 1918 Byron , Australia . Copyright : 1987 . Genre : historical romance .	-1

I have to say that I have great respect for Alice Waters because she has people thinking and cooking . But , this is how most of us over forty grew up . Not all of us are city dwellers , who unless they attended a culinary school , ca n't boil water.It amazes me that the young people in America ca n't do anything unless they have an authority giving some impramatur to validate ? ... their choices . They 're afraid of cooking , raising children , reading the wrong book , dressing themselves , voting for the right candidate , and now they 're being told to know vegetables intimately.It 's now in fashion to be a farmer . Growing up , who knew ? But most people had a garden of some sort all over America in years past and it probably was n't a business.I lived in one amall city where garden land was rented and became a daily ritual to pick fresh products and weeds . Do n't get me wrong , I love big city living where you can pick and choose the best eateries daily as well . But I am nonplussed by young people telling me how important it is to subscribe to sustainable farming , farm to table food prep . I mean geez , these poor things did n't know this already ? And that 's the point , do n't live like sheep , you did n't discover eating , cooking and picking food . Also do n't be smug and live this movement with a vengence , you 'll be missing a lot . Remember the people who came before , they were probably healthier than you . Use your imagination and do n't be so lazy , find out for yourself . You do n't know it all and neither does Alice or Oprah !	-1
I 've been reading all of Lisa See 's stuff , so have finally settled on the Red Princess works . Flower Net is my first . It is n't the same kind of work that Gold Mountain , or Shanghai Girls and the other novels of Lisa 's ancestors or general ancestry.This story is about people who are n't related to Lisa and it 's in a genre that does n't quite fit an historical novelist 's finest skill . I felt that she got lost in the mystery novel that is n't her native skill . Maybe she outlined the concept and filled it in afterward ? What happened was there were shocking things that happened , but there were few entwined twists that lead to each catharsis . They just `` happened . '' No teeny-tiny hints , no itty-bitty clues that a great mystery writer embeds in the early part of the story to tease people along to when things erupt . Then , at the end , she just explains the whole thing to satisfy the reader . I appreciated that , but I find mystery stories that are crafted to allow the reader to build their own mental evidence to be more intriguing.This story was more of a tome ( a slice of a news story ) . The relationship between David and Hulan was more interesting that what they did in the mystery , so for the romance folks this should be satisfying . The mystery folks were left kinda cold .	-1
I wo n't take your time with jargon as I 'll assure you that you will want to quickly move on reading descriptions about another book . I agree 100 % with the reviewer roxie52 . This book should have ended halfway through and not waste our time reading more . Maybe there was a word quota ? Who knows.Do not recommend . Actually I do n't recommend any of Oprah 's book club books .	-1
I disliked this book so much that every time I see it on the library shelves , I 'm tempted to hide it behind the stacks so no one else will have to suffer through it.The problem for me was not the writing -- it was that I did n't care for a single character in the entire book . The murder was almost incidental , the trip to Disney World seemed so incongruous that it came across as an attempt by the author to justify her family 's vacation as `` research , '' and therefore a tax write-off.The thing the author should realize is that when someone as unlikeable as this victim gets killed , no one really CARES who did it . They just shout `` Hurray ! '' and move on .	-1
I think the biggest problem for me was Bitsy , I found her extremely irritating and dull . Most people in the book were so taken with her , but there was no justification for the constant adoration showered upon her . This book was also too darn long ! I just wanted it to end already ! Dorothy was funny , but the letters really got to be a bit much . I would n't say not to read it because it seems that all the other reviewers loved it . BUT , I would n't have too high of expectations and just check it out at the library -- no need to buy this one .	-1
This book says it 's a fast paced suspense novel . I have 10 pages to go and theres nothing fast about this book . I am still waiting for the suspense and I 'm so bored it 's ridiculous . I would n't reccomend this book to anyone . And ... if I hear the words `` Mental Note '' in this book one more time I think I 'll burn this book .	-1
very strange stories . well written but not my style . Just did n't seem like there was much of a plot to them	-1
In a few words : Boring . Overblown . Pretentious and unrealistic . Poorly written . Clumsy , clunky sentences.Give me a break ! A few wonderful visual images do not redeem hundreds of underdeveloped characters , unfinished story lines , and poor editing , and chalking it up to & quot ; circular Indian thinking & quot ; is ridiculous.I give two , as opposed to one , stars due to the potential of a great story -- -ie , the author has imagination . Beyond that , I do n't get the hype .	-1
This is my first and last Stuart Woods book . I wanted to try a new author so , unfortunately , I went out and purchased this book . It was so unbalanced where the political characters are concerned ( all the good guys are Democrats and all the bad guys are Republicans or conservatives ) that I almost gave up in the first quarter of the book . However , I am a disciplined reader so I finished the book . I suggest that the next time Mr. Woods wants to write a book with a one-sided political viewpoint he just write a white paper for all good liberals to read and spare the rest of us from his preaching . I will gag every time I see a Stuart Woods book on the bookshelf from now on .	-1
I recently heard an hour-long interview with Murray on this book and was troubled by the tone of his conversation . He described the book in fairly innocuous terms as an attempt by a quantitiative social scientist to document & quot ; creative explosions. & quot ; However , whenever the interviewer would ask him about other grand non-Western achievements such as the Egyptian civilization , the Umayyad 's and Moors in Iberia , the Central Asian artists and poets , the Aztec and the Incas -- he would dismiss them as great but not of the same & quot ; magnitude & quot ; as Europe . Murray completely neglects the borrowing of traditions that went on in Europe as a reason for the increased & quot ; magnitude. & quot ; He also neglects the influence of colonialism in artificially augmenting Europe 's accomplishments . If you are interested in the question of why certain societies have & quot ; accomplished & quot ; more , I would suggest Jared Diamond 's pulitzer prize-winning book Guns Germs and Steel . Murray should also be more forthright in discussing the negative consequences of presenting data of this kind without constructive commentary . This was the same problem with The Bell Curve . While the analysis may be internally consistent and statistically impeccable , the role of the social scientist is also to discern what the research could be used for and how it can potentially reinforce negative stereotypes about societies and cultures . If you are going to present such highly charged data , that is fine , but then spend the extra time in contextualizing it and preventing its misuse by prejudicial circles .	-1
If your into conspiracy theories , be my guest and read the book , I read the book at my local library , and Thought it was fun , entertaining , however amusing , it is NOT FACTUAL . and caters to people who believe we did not land on the moon , or that oswald did not act alone ( oliver commie stone ) etc . It 's a book to pass the time , but not a serious book , read before you buy and see if it fits your mold ?	-1
I expect that individuals who write history to have a political point of view , but this book is entirely beyond having a slant . The reader can not get past the author 's political views to try to understand what happened , rather it a collection of events viewed through jaded eyes with the goal of convincing the reader of Zinn 's political agenda . I have a master 's in history and I am not sure I have ever read garbage quite like this book.A good example at how his politics overshadow and jade everything is his viewpoints on World War 2 . He seems to say that Nazi Germany , the Soviet Union , and the United States are actually much more similar to each other than the popular history suggests . While I am ashamed of the some of the ways that our country has treated other countries and the U.S. history of slavery and racial inequality - to say we are so similar to Nazi Germany shows a complete lack of understanding of the depths of Nazi atrocities and a political agenda/view that seems to overshadow basic facts and understanding of past events.There are plenty of very good surveys of American history out there that are much better than this one - skip this book and get another book on American history .	-1
This was a difficult read . I 've never read Allende before so I assumed that maybe the problem was in a translation or something . And then I read the other customer reviews which says that this is simply not her best book . On that , I ca n't comment . But this was not my favorite either . I was tempted to abandon the book at several points . It got mildly intriguing when the & quot ; California gold rush & quot ; got underway , and I found this book to take so many bizarre turns , I stuck with it . I think Allende was trying to make too many statements about disjointed social issues and ultimately , her point got lost entirely . There 's social class issues , gender issues , race issues , moral issues ( the prostitutes were memorable ) , ethnic issues and on and on . What was her point ? ... Do n't know if I can recommend this one .	-1
The title . To put a mockingbird or any other singing bird above all others is counter-intuitive . All living beings have the same value , all life is inherently unique . The author posits that the mockingbird does no harm , but the insects it eats would say otherwise . The mockingbird is just as base , just as feral as a tiger.The novel . `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' is certainly a regional tale and yet it is entirely transposed and made unique . The fundamental flaw of the work is patriarch , Atticus Finch . Behold the savior of the down trodden race , raise him high and everlasting , let his name be known across the dark land.The land is dark because Atticus overshadows it , his skills as a lawyer of more import than the man he defends . His family , friends and town are props conspicuously used to frame the towering moral height of the man . Summed up : `` To Kill a Mockingbird '' is an exaggerated Norman Rockwell painting.Chris Roberts , Killer of Mockingbirds .	-1
This is Louisiana native , Rebecca Wells ' third installment into the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Saga . Wells , who is also an actor and playwright , has been riding high on the success of the bestseller Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood which has been translated into 23 languages since its release in 1996.If you are not familiar with the Ya-Yas , they are four Louisiana women who 've been friends since childhood ( as young as 4 ) in the 1930s . Once a Ya-Ya , always a Ya-Ya . It even gets passed down through lineage producing Petite Ya-Yas ( their children ) and Tres Petites Ya-Yas ( their grandchildren ) . Ya-Yas hold friendship and family at the top of their list of values along with `` unconditional loyalty , high-style and southern sass '' .Ya-Yas in Bloom starts off with family tree diagrams for each Ya-Ya , Vivi , Caro , Teensy and Necie . As I continued to read I found them to be a definite asset , having to refer to them numerous times . The following chapters are divided into four sections titled : Sowing Sisterhood Seeds , Tending Young Buds , Bruised Plantings , and A Bountiful Garden.Ya-Yas in Bloom continues to languish on the emotional ties present amongst women and the bond of `` true sister-friends '' . At page three I decided I was going to like this book because of the voice . The opening story was narrated by Vivi who 's 68 going on 49 . Unfortunately this feeling did n't hold until the end . More than half way through it began to feel like a bunch of leftover vignettes thrown together . There are just too many narrators : Vivi , Sidda , Baylor and even the occasional omnipresent voice take the reins . Ya-Yas in Bloom reads like the special features on a DVD giving some background on the well-loved characters.What I enjoyed most about Bloom is the loyalty of the characters to one another and to one another 's family . I enjoyed reading about Ya-Ya parties and how everyone prepared for the events ; even the children who often hid watching in awe of their Ya-Ya parents . And comical moments which I could relate to , like the chapter on snow in the South when Little Shep was so excited about seeing snow for the first time he ran into the glass pane of a patio door and knocked himself unconscious.While individually , some of these stories are heart warming as a whole they do n't connect into a cohesive novel . If you 're an obsessive Ya-Ya fan who just ca n't get enough or want more background then this book is for you . Otherwise , it 's too flat for popular consumption . Reviewed by M. E. Wood .	-1
This was my for Johanna Lindsey and will be my last . It was sooooooooo boring ! I made myself finish it because I 'd foolishly spent 8 bucks on it . What a waste . I wish I had n't bought it or at least finished it . The characters were blah and just annoying . The `` romance '' was even more boring , with the characters feeling nothing more than luke-warm sentiments for one another . YAWN .	-1
The first time I read this book ( YEARS AGO ) I thought it 's tips and suggestions might be helpful . I applied many of the tips in my communicating with men I worked with and the man I was involved with . I found myself coddling these men . I found that I was walking on pins and needles around these men , because I was trying to be empathetic towards their needs and less about mine . I then read many of Patricia Evans ' books ( e.g . The Verbally Abusive Relationship , etc . ) and found out that I worked for and was involved with verbally abusive men . John Gray 's tips and suggestions just made the verbal abuser 's behavior towards me even worse . I picked up the audio book at the library just recently and listened to it . It made me cringe listening to it . I had flashbacks to the abusers I was involved with at the time I first read this book . I would not suggest this book to anyone , especially someone who is involved with verbally abusive men/women .	-1
Some parts of this book are really interesting and a great read while others you are fighting not to fall asleep as they are so boring . When Keller is actually on the job as a hit man it is fascinating and must turn the next page to find out what will happen next reading , but when he is not on the job his life is very boring . Stamp collecting , visiting an astrologer , jury duty and things like this just are n't interesting.Basically this book is about a professional killer named Keller who has some competition . Only problem is that his competition does n't want any , and it soon becomes apparent to Keller that if he does n't work out who his rival is and kill him first he will be killed himself . If Lawrence Block had maybe concentrated a little more on this aspect rather than the boring chapters he wrote then this book could have been five stars . Without the editing it barely makes two and a half .	-1
My son is in the fourth grade and loves to write so this seemed like a natural purchase for him . Sadly , I 'm not even going to bother passing it along.I should mention that I loved Sarah Plain and Tall . The author 's slow , poetic voice suited that era very well , it just is n't working here . The characters do n't sound like real children at all . For example , at one point , in the course of normal conversation with his friends , a nine-year-old boy character says , `` And soon words will float out of his mouth like clouds . '' They write and speak like this throughout.It was almost like she was writing kids as she wishes they were rather than as they actually are . I suppose this book might appeal to a thoughtful adult writer , but I think it would be a rare child who would be interested .	-1
My wife bought it for our kids and brought it home . Before she got halfway into it , she returned it . I personally would n't bother reading anything by Dr. Lala , the homophobe . I do n't want our children exposed to her pop b.s . The reason for the HIGH RATING is for the great illustrations . That 's it .	-1

I came across this nasty bit of dated tripe last weekend and decided to try to read it . I made it some 30 pages and had to stop . `` Vile '' is the only word I can think of to describe this book and its author . Well , `` phony '' is another word.Moore makes a point of telling us how he lives as a wealthy white man in the whitest , wealthiest section of Manhattan . He then spends a chapter telling us how much he cares about black people . Well , a move some 40 blocks north and Moore could actually LIVE amongst the people that he so loves , but like most liberals , Moore is all talk when it comes to race . Moore also laments the fact that his publishing company is all white . Again , Moore had the option of publishing with a black-owned company but then he would have to give up the huge advance . Phony from end to end.We do n't hear much from Moore these days . I guess a rotting sandwich gets thrown out sooner or later .	-1
It is truly sad when a person hates oneself so much . The self-hatred Moore has is really a shame . Under achievers such as Mike are naturally drawn to this masochistic behavior . The amount of meletonin in one 's skin is a meaningless determinant of good or evil . In fact , it is the very same ugly racism that Moore claims to abhor that he uses in the title of his book . Why , Mike ? I know that belonging to labor unions would tend to give one the feeling that , apart from group identification , one has little inherent value . Individual responsibility and rights tend to get swept away in favor of group rights with no accountability . But again , this has nothing to do with race . The idea that one race is just more virtuous than another is repugnant to good people of all races . Moore 's arguments and even his humor would be more effective if he did not engage in such self-loathing . No person has anything to feel guilty about if that guilt is based on the actions of another . Save your money , readers . There are much better political , social , and comedic commentaries out there . This is a sorry excuse for a book .	-1
Michael Moore heaps scorn and ridicule on America , especially our inept , dishonest , and `` stupid '' political leaders , and does so with considerable rancor , while trying for a tone of folksy humor . He calls George Bush the `` Thief-in-Chief , '' and also harshly criticizes Bill Clinton . If Michael is correct , we live in an extremely corrupt nation , led by incompetent white men who are both dishonest and stupid . He offers his ultimate solution to these problems in a chapter called `` Kill Whitey . '' Is n't THAT a hoot ? ! Michael has frequently been asked by interviewers about gross factual inaccuracies in this book , which he tries to deflect by saying it 's `` political humor . '' Where he cites data or facts , he often provides backnotes to identify the source . A check of a few of his sources consistently shows that his sources do NOT support his assertions -- -- -that he has consistently misrepresented the factual information he uses to demonstrate the `` stupidity '' of his targets.This kind of `` art '' and extremely harsh rhetoric continues to make it more and more difficult for liberals and conservatives to LISTEN to each other about their LEGITIMATE concerns . It does terrible disservice to the quality of our political dialogue , and I do n't recommend this book .	-1
I was a fan of Mr. Lamb 's first book , but this was not a winner , rather 700+ pages of meandering concepts with characters who can not be believed . I read the entire length of the novel hoping to find some redeeming value , but at the end was left with a quasi-spiritual flop undeserving of the hours I lost and should have spent on chores around our home . I found the one-sided political jabs annoying and repetative . The protagonist is a black hole into which human decency seems to have been swallowed , and to have been led to sympathize with some of the most morally depraved individuals ( Lolly and Velvet ) was disturbing at best . On the bright side , this book was lent to me , and I did n't waste $ 20 ...	-1
Overstuffed with WAY to much information ; historical and fictional , confused , convoluted , this book was boring and exhausting to read . I had to take a break from it for a while . The characters and events had tenuous connections to each other and it seemed like Lamb was just stuffing them in to document Columbine , Hurricane Katrina , etc even though the connections did not make realistic sense . I stopped caring about Caelum , his family , his cheating wife , everyone . No one in the book seemed to love each other , except maybe Velvet Hoon ( does that even sound like a real name ? ) to Caelum and his wife . Also , Velvet is supposed to be related to an Italian master stone carver from the past , but Velvet does n't have an Italian last name . Ok , so maybe her dad or someone in her family was not Italian , ( I have heard of `` Shannon Hoon '' from Blind Melon , so maybe it is real , maybe ... .. ) but to me , it would have been more believable if she did have an Italian last name . The other character that showed love was Mr. Mpipi , an African immigrant who worked as a janitor at Caelum 's school when Caelum was a boy . He shares his African culture with the kids and does `` the dance of great hunger and the dance of great love . '' ( Because we hunger for love , he says . As I did when I was reading this book . ) He is a delightful character , but he is only mentioned once in the beginning and then just seems be forgotten . I was hoping he would appear later in the book , as an elderly man , and maybe the adult Caelum talks to and learns something from him , but he never did . I was disappointed about that . It seems like Lamb just kept getting new ideas and forgetting about old ones , instead of developing the old ones and bringing them back , and tying up loose ends like a novel writer should . It was maddening to me and it seemed like the book itself had ADHD . Fortunately , Velvet 's story was tied up at the end in a happy ending , and Caelum finds peace with his relatives ( whoever they may be and whatever the heck they did ) . A relief when it finally ended .	-1
After waiting 10 years for Wally Lamb to write another great book , I was sorely disappointed in this one . I did finish it but there were several times when I almost gave up . The main character irritated me so much I wanted to reach into the pages and slap him . And I never quite figured out what the book 's theme was : teenage violence , women 's prisons , dysfunctional marriages , weird teenage girls , Hurricane Katrina , dairy farming , yellow Mustangs , the butterfly affect , Mark Twain ... .it was such a mixed-up bag of messages , enough to frustrate any Wally Lamb fan . And , as another reviewer noted , all the characters that might have been truly interesting were dead and we never get to meet them except through writings or Caelum 's self-centered mind . One of the greatest living American writer 's , Joyce Carol Oates wrote a novel based on the Jon Benet Ramsey murder and did a far , far better job of incorporating a violent true-life event into a brilliant tour de force about a young man 's trauma in the aftermath of disaster . Mr. Lamb 's latest does not seem like 10 years worth of work but it did seem like it took 10 years to read it .	-1
The only nice thing I can say about The Hour I First Believed is that it is ambitious about a difficult subject matter - the Columbine Massacre and PTSD . However , the weaving of additional sub-plots of addiction , broken relationships , painful childhoods , forgiveness , and the forging of new romantic interests just kills any meaningful discourse on PTSD or the shooting . Broken into three parts the first and most compelling portion of the book covers the Columbine shooting itself with actual passages taken from the shooters own words . That was a strange sentence to write . The other two parts are suppose to be about the difficulties dealing with and the recovery from survivors guilt/PTSD . But here the book goes off the rails and manders from sub-plot to the next rendering the first part and the main plot as backdrop for Lamb 's other musings . I ca n't escape the feeling that the Japanese authors have read have done just as much as Lamb has here but managed to do it about a fifth of the length.I also think that there needs to be a dreaded , slightly decretory tone saying for literary fiction about unnecessary but detailed biographical stories of characters like there is for the & # 34 ; info dump & # 34 ; in science fiction . Complex biographical back stories that adds nothing to the plot , does n't add complexity to the characters , it just bores the readers and shows how shallow the characterization is in the first place . The weird thing is that this biographical detail was n't needed at all , the characters were already fully fleshed out with sides to their lives that were n't directly tied to moving the plot forward . Not one of the better reads of the year .	-1
Before this book , I was an admirer of Wally Lamb 's novels . They have a lot in common : long , first-person picaresque and rambling , Lamb 's books tap into large , philosophical themes like the meaning of life , the value of family , the role of faith . These are big novels with big , showy titles.So , Lamb sets himself major challenges as a writer . That 's good . This time , though , he is n't able to meet those challenges successfully . The angry , self-indulgent , graceless narrator , Caelum Quirk , is not engaging enough for the reader to care about his various ancestors and friends . The letters from Caelum 's civil war era great-grandmother , which ramble on for pages and pages , are dull and self-justifying . Too much of the book is just plain put-downable . A lot of it borders on glib . Finally , the story is harnessed to an allegorical framework ( the quest , the minotaur , the maze ) that tries too hard to bring together too many disparate stories and overburdens the fiction with historical background . The resulting novel is labored , mechanical , and pretentious . Especially pretentious is the matter at the back of the book , which includes everything from a musical playlist of tunes that inspired Lamb to a list of charities to which a reader affected by the story might wish to donate.One of the biggest risks Lamb takes is setting part of the book in the center of the real Columbine tragedy . He explains in an afterword why he thought that this choice was the right one , why to do otherwise would be to shirk the true implications of his story -- and he shows some humility and sympathy for the people who actually experienced this terrible day . But it would take a writer more brilliant than Lamb ( at least as he performs in this novel ) to do true justice to that real experience . I found his use of this event , with its shock value , more prurient than illuminating . I know this was n't his intention , but his use of Columbine seemed manipulative and exploitative to me . I felt he was trading on real pain for a fictional pay off .	-1
Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and Wicked being two of my favorite books , I was excited to dig in to Mirror Mirror . However , after only about two dozen pages I found myself losing interest because I was profoundly confused about who was telling the story.In a nutshell , that was the main problem I had with Mirror Mirror : though Maguire 's descriptions were as textured as ever , the fragmented narration made it difficult to fully relate to the characters . The characterization in his other books was so layered that I cared about the major and minor characters alike ( even in Son of a Witch , which while good was not quite as dazzling as its predecessor ) . This story focuses on Bianca and her father , Vicente , but I did not feel particularly connected to either of them - they seemed to function more as symbolic placeholders than as actual people . The one real exception to this problem was Lucrezia Borgia : Mirror Mirror was really her tale , and she was by far the most engaging character to me . But her voice is only peppered throughout the narrative ; Bianca , Vicente , and the dwarves also speak at different times , and I found the structure too fragile to be effective.The magical elements in this story did not gel for me , either . The magical elements in Wicked were inherent to the story and Confessions used folk superstition to create an air of the supernatural , but I did not feel I had to totally suspend disbelief to read either one . With Mirror Mirror , though , the branch from the Tree of Knowledge was a hard pill to swallow ( what the heck was up with the final chapter ? ) , as was the dwarves ' characterization . The dwarves are first described as primitive creatures born of the earth , more mineral than human , yet simply by Bianca speaking to them are they able to speak the languages of men with complete fluency . While I realized that Maguire was asking the reader to explore the idea of imagining something into your own reality , that whole concept seemed out of place in this setting.I managed to finish this book because I do adore Maguire 's descriptive prowess and the sly wit he incorporates into the dialogue , but Mirror Mirror is definitely not his best showing - which is sad , because he had some fantastic ideas to work with . If you 're a fist-time Maguire reader , start with Wicked or Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister .	-1
I read Gregory Maguire 's Wicked and absolutely loved it . I adore the idea of taking a common story and putting a twist on it . I was excited about this new book , so I reserved it at the library before it had even been published.I was sorely disappointed and that is being kind . I felt like I missed something important in the story telling process that would explain what was happening . The basic plot of the story is easy enough to follow.Bianca de Nevada 's name literally translates into White from Snow ( Nevada being a snowy region ) . Bianca is the daughter of a landowner , Vicente , who 's mother died during childbirth . She lives with the cook , Primavera who acts as her nanny and Fra Ludovico , a priest . While draining a lake for irrigation purposes , they find a mirror laying at the bottom and put it up on a wall in their home.One day a campaign comes through and the Borgia siblings , Cesare and Lucrezia pay Bianca and her father a visit . The Borgia 's are historical people , known for their wicked ways . Cesare sends Vicente out on a quest to find the lost limb of the Tree of Knowledge.The quest spans a decade and while Vicente is gone , Lucrezia drops in from time to time under the pretense of making sure Bianca is safe . She does n't like the girl , but is never malicious toward her until her brother , Cesare comes along and is aroused by Bianca 's beauty . Lucrezia is jealous of the attention Cesare gives to her and is bent on killing her.She employs Primavera 's grandson , a hunter , to take her out into the forest and kill her , bringing back her heart . The hunter takes her out to the forest and tells her to run away , which she does.This is the part where I get a little sketchy because somehow Bianca falls into a deep sleep that spans several years . While she is sleeping , dwarves look after her . The dwarves are not those that appear in the Disney cartoon , they are completely separate and odd creatures . They are not really aware of themselves as unique individuals until Bianca comes to them . They are stone shape-shifters , obviously not human . There 's nothing really interesting or endearing about the dwarves.When Bianca wakes up , there is an odd scene where her menstrual fluid comes out in one big spurt , as if it was being held back all those years . I 'm still not exactly sure what that is supposed to symbolize.Bianca is quick to & quot ; befriend & quot ; the dwarves , although that is n't really the correct terminology because they are not her friends . They name themselves for her with names like Heartless , Gimpy and MuteMuteMute . They speak of an eighth , their brother . He has followed Vicente on his journey . The goal was to get their mirror back . Yes , of course , the mirror that was found at the bottom of the lake belongs to the dwarves . They created it in order to study humans so that they , themselves , might become more human.Vicente comes back from his journey with the limb . The limb contained three apples . One was left in another place for safe keeping . When he comes back , he learns his daughter is dead and Primavera has lost her tongue . Although it never states why , it is evident that Lucrezia had it cut out so Primavera would n't speak the truth she knew about Bianca . Lucrezia takes one of the apples and offers a slice to the stone dwarf that is following Vicente . The creature eats the slice and then takes the rest of the apple when it is offered to him by Lucrezia.The dwarf then leaves and returns to his brothers . They all eat from the apple . It seems to make them more human . It makes them age and change like a human would.Lucrezia learns that Bianca is still alive from the gooseboy who saw her in the forest . The gooseboy is supposedly Lucrezia 's son , but that is another detail I missed the explanation for . Lucrezia becomes mad and tries several different ways to kill Bianca . She finally takes the last of the apples she was given and puts poison on one side of it . She gets Bianca to eat the apple by tasting from the non-poisoned side first.Bianca goes into another deep sleep lasting for years . The dwarves recapture their mirror and take the glass out to place over her coffin . Vicente stumbles upon her and just sits there for years before wandering off and dying . The gooseboy stumbles upon her and takes the glass off her coffin and asks to kiss her . The hunger , Primavera 's grandson , comes back and stops the gooseboy and takes the pleasure for himself , awaking Bianca.Meanwhile Lucrezia wants to be happy and will stop at nothing for it . She is obsessed with the apple and feels that if she could have only had more of it , she would be happy . She remembers the third apple Vicente spoke of and sets off to find it . When she gets there , she finds a man who is using the apple himself . He has it in place of his heart.The end - that 's it . The whole sordid tale does n't make much sense to me . The story is too hard to follow and no one seems to be motivated to act the way they 're acting . Things just happen for no good reason . Nothing is really explained very well.As mentioned before , this is a disappointment compared with Wicked . No magical world was created for me filled with wonder and emotion , friendships and excitement . Just a hard-to-follow story that is trying desperately to be exactly like , yet hardly familiar to the story of Snow White .	-1
I 've read 64 biographys and it 's one of the worse.There are a few photos.some informations are odd , because the author invents them.buy not this book , but buy better book like a common good , the thirteen days , the kennedys and the fitzgerald , robert kennedy and his time ...	-1
The protagonist was n't very likeable ; the plot extremely unbelievable , and the graphic sex overdone . I did enjoy the medical parts ... someone in an earlier review refrerred to the Vital Signs column in Discover & this part of the book was fascinating . Do n't bother buying it ; check out at the library/	-1
I 've read all of Sister Roby 's books and I would be remiss to say this one was comparable to any of her previous work . This was utter trash . Apart from my personal opinions on interracial relationships , the book did n't flow well and I 've read creative writing stories by sixth graders that were better than this.The characters were weak , soap opera-ish and one-dimensional . I realize that sometimes fact is stranger than fiction , but come on ... Who in their right mind ( some of you know what I mean when I say `` right mind '' ) would run into the arms of a white man when their spouse has left them for a white person , goes to work everyday to be betrayed by white folks and then in the end is still pushed aside by said white man ? Every page seemed to be a PSA for the Rainbow Coalition as well as justification and rationalization . If you 're going to do it , at least do it well.Trash . Just trash .	-1
The Simmons I love is the one in Hyperion , Summer of Night , and The Terror . Stories with a good balance of good underlying ideas for the plot , exceptional character development , and phiolosophical themes . The stories in Worlds Enough have only one of them : philosophy . Lots and lots of it . There is so little else going on than one wonders why does n't Simmons just write a non fiction philosophical book and get it out of his system already . The last story in particular was so dull I could n't wait for it to end . The others were mostly Zen riddles , you know , the kind that leaves you scratching your head wonderig what the heck did you just read ? The only passable one was the story set in the Hyperion universe , which earns the few stars I am giving .	-1
Light and fluffy with no real content except discontent and the exercise of bad judgement . The first half of the book hints at the possibility of some deepness in the second half , but disappoints in that respect . The `` Afterward '' gives the appearance of the story being non-fiction , but unless the author is using a male pseudonym , that would be impossible.If you want to follow the meaningless lives of two sisters and wallow in the elder 's loneliness , peccadilloes , and bad judgements then this is a book for you . The older sister of the first half of the book has so much potential which is fully destroyed by the author in the second half .	-1
I just finished , & # 34 ; After I 'm Gone. & # 34 ; Though I did n't love it ( plodding , with needlessly quirky characters and occasionally numbing backstory ) I want to love Laura Lippmann , so I thought I would work my way forward through her stand-alone novels.Other reviewers have summarized the plot and explored the clues which go nowhere , the vast overpopulation of unnecessary and unlikable characters , and the disappointment of the end.I 'm left with a question . Did Cynthia and Warren adopt Alice 's baby ? If not , would n't the book have been a whole lot better if they had ?	-1
The hero is in his mid fourties , the heroine is 20 or 23 yrs old ( writer forgot what age , mentioned 2 different ages . I am not into old men going with young girls , reminds me too much of pedophilia . Hero is boring and straight laced and heroine is a tart , so are the other women . There is a difference between sexy and vulgar.I am not even finishing this book and will toss the other book I ordered from same writer . Instead try some of the Harlequin Historicals , their writers may not be as well known , but know how to write a story .	-1
Why do I feel that Eloisa James is trying to make historical romances seem like contemporaries ? Her female characters -- including the multiple heroines -- are promiscuous and utterly contemptuous of society 's mores.Esme , the willing widow type , has had multiple affairs during her arranged marriage to an older man . Adultery in a heroine is hard to swallow , but this sort of behavior was condoned as long as the parties involved were discreet.Ditto with Arabella , the aunt , a widow three times over . Okay , these two are not really heroine material , in my view , but they 're borderline acceptable.What is n't acceptable is the young , unattached Beatrice , ostensibly the primary heroine of the piece , who dresses and acts like a doxy because she was `` ruined '' and can never marry , so what other choice does she have ? This is a heroine ? ? ? Well , perhaps if she had some terrible secret in her past that made her that way , but simply being a precocious teenager does n't quite do it for me.Eloisa James has this annoying tendency of creating convincingly depraved characters and then insisting that they really are n't so bad after all . I did n't like it when she did it with Rees Godwin and his mistress ( that situation still makes me hot under the collar ) , and I do n't like it here . Bea is either a tart or she is not , and I fear that any young girl who goes around offering herself to gentlemen has to be a tart . At least in the 19th century.In the 21st century , society is more forgiving . But the ease in which these willing widows and demimondaine characters find their way into the upper echelons of 19th century society is simply not believable by anyone reasonably familiar with the period.I ca n't recommend this book to anyone . In fact , James ' last two books have been disappointments , and I wo n't even buy the one before that because of negative reviews and a likewise disappointing plot . Hopefully the tide will turn soon . . . .	-1
It took me 1 month to finish reading this book . It was a disappointment compared to his other novels . It 's a waste of money and time .	-1
I 'm sorry , I found this book a total bore . None of the characters were particularly remarkable or interesting -- although , my heart went out to little Charlie . I could n't figure out why Mr. Kimble married the first wife . Not much in it for him with that one except youth . And what was he doing while he spend so many hours away from home ? Was he truly engrossed in his business or was he with other women ? There are just too many people like him and too many dumb women in real life to make this book interesting . Nothing unique about it . If I had n't been stuck in the middle of nowhere with nothing else to read I would n't have read it . It makes the good books out there seem so much better .	-1
The authors here assert that they have discovered revealing new information about the Fischer Spassky match from declassified KGB files and the like . The reality is that this is simply a story retold with nothing of significance that I did not already know from memory and other sources . That does not make it a bad story for those who are not familiar with the match , but it does make it less than advertised for those who are . Even if some details were presented for the first time , I would not have much faith in their accuracy given the book 's plethora of factual errors . ( Palma de Mallorca is referred to as a `` walled city , a decisive game of less than 20 moves between GMs is said to be so rare as to be `` historic , '' etc . ) It is clear that the authors know little or nothing about chess , so chess players in particular can be safely warned away from this book . Not only are they more likely to be familiar with the book 's content , but they will also be more sensitive to the authors ' many mistakes and exaggerations .	-1
Any book that is so annoying I ca n't finish it does not deserve more than 1 star . Since I did n't have the `` Vietnam experience '' I can only review the book based on the story itself , so forgive me if my rating does not include it 's relevance to the Vietnam era .The beginning of the book was pretty good , despite some inconsistencies , and as I approached the middle of the book I planned to give it 3 stars . This first half of the book takes place in space , as our main character goes though boot camp , graduates , and goes on his first mission to fight the enemy aliens . Most of this is pretty good story-telling , though as a hard science fiction fan I was disturbed by a few `` common sense science '' issues:1 . The space army is made up of the `` best and brightest '' of earth ( everyone with a masters or doctorate in the sciences is automatically drafted ) . They go through rigorous training but we do n't see much in the way of military tactics being taught . That 's because once in actual combat they are given a post-hypnotic command that turns them into unthinking killing machines ( author 's description ) . Why do we draft the brightest minds of all humanity if all we 're going to do is say some magic words and turn them into mindless murdering zombies ? 2 . Boot camp is on a frigid , absolute-zero world , but our soldiers cope with that by using high-tech suits with insulation so perfect they need a heat exchanger to keep from dying of heat stroke . The environment is so dangerous that half the recruits will die during basic training , mostly from accidents where the hot heat-exchanger fins touch frozen helium and cause an explosion . Like me , you may wonder why none of these `` best and brightest '' people ever thought about using the perfect insulator material of the suit as a protective cage around the hot fins , or to use it on their boot soles to keep them from sliding on frozen lakes of helium that evaporates as soon as their foot touches it . Or why not leave a small area of the suit with a less-than-perfect insulator so you do n't need an air conditioner at all , or why not.. ( the list goes on ) .3 . Once we have a battle , the alien base is captured , and we have lots of other-worldly gadgets to play with , you might expect the `` best and brightest '' solders would be put to work trying to make sense of this new technology . This could be an interesting part of the story , but no , instead we bring in a never-before-mentioned team of `` scientists '' and the soldiers go back to the ship . I do n't expect much from the scientists , considering they can only be the `` second brightest '' people from earth ? The story really gets bad once our heroes make it back to earth , where , with relativity effects , about 30 years have passed since they left . This new earth is full of impossible economic and social situations , such as:1 . Unemployment is over 60 % , yet menial jobs pay so much money that a person can afford to live on a fraction of the actual wages . ( I say `` menial '' because it only takes a day to train a new person to take over your job and you split the salary with them , keeping half for doing nothing ) .2 . The United Nations controls all the jobs , and doles them out to only the poorest citizens . Yet with such absurdly high pay scales it is never explained how a previously-poor person keeps his job for very long , because after a year or two the person must be reasonably wealthy , and thus lose their job to a poorer person.3 . With the economy so bad and jobs in such high demand , you might think those controlling the jobs would be subject to bribery , but we 're told they are `` 100 % incorruptible '' . On the other hand , all you have to do is contact your local black-market job dealer at the corner bar and you can get a second-hand ( or third-hand ) job in no time , where you work someone else 's job for 1/2 , 1/4 or even 1/8 of the salary , which is enough to live on , so much so that you can afford to pay the black-market job dealer a portion of your 1/8 wages.4 . Crime is so bad that every non-criminal citizen must hire a personal bodyguard so they can survive the elevator ride to and from their apartment . Wait - I thought the UN controlled all jobs , so where do personal body guards come from ? And how does the 60 % of the population living on government subsidies pay for their bodyguards ? Is body-guard pay included in your government check ? 5 . Because the entire planet is in a constant state of starvation , criminals about to be sent to jail are shanghaied by farming communes for use as slave labor , but the commune keeps the criminal 's government food ration book and uses it to supplement their food supply . Really ? The government ca n't track the criminal fugitives by their ration books ? 6 . The farm communes are constantly being attacked by roving gangs of starving people , who steal the farm 's food and then `` escape into the forests '' . Forests ? Huh ? In an over-populated world where food is scarce we still have un-farmed forests for the hoodlums to hide in ? Why do n't they just cut down the trees and start their own farm ? At this point I was still reading , ( as I re-read this review I wonder why ) but when I came across this next gem I had to end the torture - The biggest fear of earth is that the alien war will end and wreck the economy . What ? The economy is not wrecked now ? And how could keeping the best brains of humanity on earth instead of killing them off on a distant planet wreck the economy ? How could using all our high-tech gadgets to improve living conditions at home be worse than sending our technology into space never to be seen again ? And how could keeping the GDP of a planet circulating though the economy cause economic turmoil ? This world created by the authors is so unbelievable that I simply could not continue reading the book . I am not such a critical reader that I ca n't overlook a few inconsistencies here and there , especially when they are minor distractions and not critical to the plot . But an entire world where every aspect of life defies logic and common sense is just too much for me .	-1
Naomi Wolf was a lovely young slip of a girl when she wrote this remarkably brainless book . The only reason people paid attention to this idiotic book was because Naomi was young and hot-looking . It drove Camille Paglia insane that Naomi was being treated like she knew anything about life . Naomi has done a lot of growing up since then , and I imagine she must be pretty humiliated that people are still reading this deeply awful book .	-1
I tried twice - kept thinking it must get better . But it did n't - not for me . I just could n't make myself finish it , and ALWAYS make myself finish books ! !	-1
I actually *bought* this in hardcover -- something I do n't usually do but I have very much enjoyed Stephenson 's earlier work ( including Interface & amp ; Cobweb under the name Stephen Bury ) and thought this would be worth the clams . It 's just not . I wish his editor had told him to slash 500 pages -- & quot ; just keep the 400 best , Neal & quot ; and then I would n't have had to sit through weird digressions that mean nothing to the plot or furniture really turn some people on . It was supposed to be a letter to Penthouse and that 's just what it read like . Yawn.I reacted very badly to his stereotypes about men and women ( he seems to be in the women-are-inscrutable-and-so-much-smarter-than-mere-men school of odd reverse sexism ) . In this world either you 're a wimpy new-age sexual disappointment or a Nip-killing caveman with enough pheromones to rend a catholic high school delirious.The story pops around from WWII to the present and there are interesting bits of actual factual content around Ultra and the German Enigma engine but I found myself wishing I was either reading a straight history of Ultra or a fictional novel about something else . There 's plenty of good stuff out there on WWII and it would make for more entertaining reading anyway.The underlying philosophy seems about as well thought out as the average Wired editorial - it may appeal to a bunch of socially inept webheads but to anyone who looks for something beyond drooling accounts of how much horsepower , RAM , Mips , penile inches etc . it 's kinda flat and thin . Basically technology is really cool and you can make a ton of money and get babes ( who of course are n't doing any of the actual technology ) doing cool things.The comparisons to Tom Clancy are certainly justified . I 've always thought poor Tom only had one good book in him ( Hunt For Red October ) and everything else was just the turgid right wing blather of someone who gets a hard on from watching military hardware . I thought Neal was better but he 'll probably sell a killzillion copies of this book and we 'll have to suffer through an endless parade of sequels . Just say no	-1
First we get the obvious out of the way ; Sean Hannity is a man with an agenda and , therefore can not see the difference between truth and whatever helps that agenda.We only have this writer 's unswerving loyalty to the Bush blunders in Iraq , his disregard of the lies Bush has told in order to get us into an unnecessary war and keep us there , and his willingness to blame others for the complete and absolute failure of `` conservative '' right wing policies to see that ANYTHING that he says or writes is suspect at best ... Now I will not claim that liberals do not themselves have an agenda , but I will compare its fruits with those advocated by the Sean Hannitys of this planet , and , for most , the comparison reveals some very obvious conclusions..School vouchers , which the right wing loves , are an excuse to divert public funds into private institutional hands ... It is also an attempt to get around a non-denominational education using public tax dollars ... If ANYONE wants a private school education they are welcome to it , AT THIER OWN EXPENSE , and not at mine ... As a taxpayer it is my obligation to contribute towards paying the costs of necessary public elements , the PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM being one of these.Any whining about how the poor somehow are being short-changed by not being able to send thier kids to private school at taxpayer expense seems hypocritical at best coming from this writer , especially as neither Hannity nor any of the other extremists he fits in with have any concern over getting the poor universal healthcare , better housing , or a higher wage..Private school education , however , is something conservatives DO want , FOR THEMSELVES , and what a nice touch it is couching thier empty blather in a bogus concern over the `` quality '' of the education recieved by the poor in our public schools ... Terrorism is , of course , a real threat ... but so is arrogance , greed , and unbridled corporate sponsored imperialism , all of which the conservative movement has in spades ... Making `` Terrorism '' the excuse for an american right wing effort to reshape the world is more than wrong , it is dangerous and criminal ... Hannity has shown himself a booster of the Bush agenda , which , considering all of the Bush lies about that war , either makes Hannity a fool or a willing co-conspirator in those lies ... Liberty , for the Hannity-types , is an ambiguous term..Libery , it seems means sifting through citizens mail secretly , torturing political prisoners secretly , trashing the constitution when its meaning is in conflict with what the right wing wants ... Liberty means bowing to christian fundamentalism..it means restricting rather than enlarging our freedoms ... it mean yearning for the good old days , when everyone '' knew his/her place '' and when bigotry , discrimanation and worse were the commonplace features of everyday life in the ideal conservative-oriented universe ... Liberty to Hannity and the other conservative thugs is not libery at all , but that is not what Hannity proclaims , either in his book or on the teevee ... Hannity 's book is trash ... it is worse than trash because it is not truthful , it is not accurate , and it is a blueprint for a society in which liberty will be replaced by goose-stepping and repression , some of which we are already experiencing under the Bush administration .	-1
Indeed this is the book Rush would have written had he not been so stoned on all those pain pills for the last how many years ? Which in fact is part of the problem here , this is cookie cutter right wing ranting could have been written by anyone who has bought the Fox News Kool Aid.Oddly missing for me in this book was any mention of the fact that Hannity 's allies on the right , people like Mr. Falwell who famously said we `` probably deserved '' 9/11 have a vision of America that is uncannily like that of the Taliban . Remember them ? I can assure you they had prayer in school , women knew their place and `` liberals '' were stoned with rocks not with handfulls of pills like Rush . But somehow the solution to fighting these theocratic fascists is to become uh theocratic fascists ourselves ... ? I 'm sorry but I just could n't make that leap ... how many pills was Rush on a day ? Sixty ? For me personally this was n't as amusing as Deliver Us from Evil , it lacked that books jolt of misanthropy this book reads more like a drooping comb over . So if you want your Hannity shrieks I do n't think this is your best value for money .	-1
Apologist , Propagandist , Lying Wimpy limp fisted crap , served up in a ham fisted sandwich like yesterdays news . Less interesting , less fun , less humour , less insight , less subtle , than the five o'clock follies , only less truthful . Less informative than a broken watch , Hannity is NEVER right . He 's just on the RIGHT , and like the rest of the Lemmings and that idiot Coulter , he 's headed over a cliff . Good Bye , Good Night , and Good riddenceJeff Gannon ( Reformed in Washington )	-1
First off , let me give credit where credit is due . The book is stylistically very good , lyrical , descriptive , and generally highfalutin ' . The characters and the situations she writes about are individually very interesting and absorbing . There 's crime , mystery , lesbians , and a host of other interesting albeit random things in Erdrich 's book.Now for the bad part- the disjointed nature of the book makes it painfully obvious that she took short stories and haphazardly stitched them together in order to market a novel . At the end , after all the connections between the characters and their actions had been revealed , and the initial joy of having finally understood what was going on passed , I was left feeling cold , empty , and unenthusiastic.In the end , this book has neither a cohesive plot nor theme , and no character is developed to the extent that it even qualifies as a novel .	-1
I have read many of Gaiman 's other books and liked them , a lot . Anansi Boys was a huge disappointment for me , twice . I tried to read it years ago and put it down due to lack of interest . Picked it back up and started over recently and got halfway through before I could n't take it anymore . Boring .	-1
Homes has a vivid imagination and outstanding writing skills . She 's in command of her storytelling technique . Her prose strikes all the right notes . She 's even good at characterization.Unfortunately , she 's a slave to literary fashion , specifically , boring , New Yorker-style catatonic realism . ( In fairness , perhaps to break the mold a little , Homes tosses in some self-consciously clever surrealistic bits here and there , but it does n't work . ) Homes gets accolades because she believes all the right things and expresses them in all the right ways -- but that 's not the sign of an intellectually rigorous writer.The women tend to be hyper-accomplished professionals , usually married to confused , weak men whom they have to dress and feed in the morning . This scenario got tired after the second story . By the fourth I began to feel like I was dealing with an ideologue.Of course , that 's the risk when you put together collections of stories from the last ten years . You start to see the writer 's tricks ... for example , several of her characters are obsessed with being prepared . They try to stock up on emergency supplies to plan for every conceivable occurrence . OK , good enough idea once . But two , three times ? Recommendation : If you like New Yorker-style fiction , you 'll really enjoy this . If you want ideas and characters explored in a little more depth , take a pass .	-1
I 've listened to Dr Laura for sometime as entertainment on long drives . She very often references this book , and many of her callers exclaim how the book saved their marriages . Out of curiosity , I bought the book ... .Well , the book is n't as interesting as her XM Radio show . Preachy , yammering , patronizing , and condescending . I did n't hate it , but I did n't like it either . Then again , I could only stand to read about 1/5 of the book -- I kept waiting for something redeeming -- but could n't read anymore . Why ? It was depressing . The examples she uses are & # 34 ; no duh & # 34 ; examples.Maybe I did n't like it because I already take good care of my husband . Maybe I did n't like it because of the tone . Maybe I did n't like it because it highlighted how awful some marriages are . But most of all , I felt like I was listening to her radio show ... Come to think of it , when people call in to say that they read the book and it helped them , I do n't think most had been listening to the radio show for any length of time . If you listen to the radio , then you do n't need to read this book . If you do n't listen to her show , then maybe this book is good for you .	-1
Schlessinger spends much of this book belittling women and explaining away all the shortcomings of men . For example , if a man is philandering , you can bet his inattentive wife is to blame . I found her overall tone to be disturbingly anti-woman and felt bad for having read it at all .	-1
Before you purchase this book consider this . On the Sean Hannity radio talk show , Goldberg said FOXNEWS is NOT biased , unlike the other major networks that are . If you think that is a credible statement , I 'm sure you 'll think his book is credible .	-1
I keep trying but can not get interested in the stories by this author . They seem to drag out with her style of `` he said/she said '' writing with nothing exciting , except perhaps one part in this book . The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht . His guide , Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea . The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over . The ending was not exciting or unexpected . Lt. Bak 's constant referrals to the donkeys ( we know how he is sympathetic to animals , this big strong medjay ! ! I had to make myself sit and finish it .	-1
I love Kathleen Tessaro and I have bought every single one of her books . This was my least favorite . To be honest I am not sure if this was her first book as a writer , but I hope so . It felt slightly & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; if you know what I mean . As if she had an idea and started writing and no one ever told her that it needed work . Love her , love her writing normally . Do n't love this book .	-1
