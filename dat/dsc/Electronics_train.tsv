I am using this with a Nook HD+ . It works as described . The HD picture on my Samsung 52 & # 34 ; TV is excellent .	1
This adapter easily connects my Nook HD 7 & # 34 ; to my HDTV through the HDMI cable . This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port . It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen . A bit pricey , but a good accessory to have . Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series . It will not work with a standard Nook .	1
This is a great buy , compared to a $ 60 or more a retail store .	1
This mount is just what I needed . It is strong and sturdy . It folds almost flat to enable the television to sit square and flat against the wall if desired and extends and rotates for angle turns . A perfect fit as long as you match the correct visa pattern for your television .	1
Holds the TV fine and the articulation is great . We use it in a downstairs bedroom where we can move it to be seen from the bed or the treadmill . Has cable mgmt as well .	1
This is the best mount I have ever found , especially for the price.Home Depot has a nearly identical mount for $ 90.This mount comes with every fastener you could need from Lags , Hollow Wall Anchors , Spacers , to varying lengths of Metric Fasteners to most if not all TVs.They mount easy and are sturdy ; I have a 60 & # 34 ; LED TV on one without issue.I also have 32 & # 34 ; , 42 & # 34 ; , 46 & # 34 ; , and 50 & # 34 ; TVs on them ; I have used these to mount every LED/LCD TV I or friends have mounted .	1
Needed a corner mounted Flatscreen . This did the job well , easy to install . I had to mount in a metal stud , so I used two support boards in the back to distribute the weight more evenly . Expectations of item met at a fraction of the cost from competitors .	1
I have purchased 3 of these wall mounts and they hold my 37 and 32 inch flat screens perfectly . I love these and highly recommend them .	1
This was perfect for my 24 '' LED monitor , I had it up in just a few mins and with no problems . It included a small bubble level and it also came with a 6 ' HDMI cable which I was not expecting .	1
Works Great . Holds my 40 inch TV effortlessly . Very well built . Definitely worth the price . Easy to install TV to the mount . Has cord clips . TV can be tilted up or down and sideways . Extends from the wall 24 inches . I highly recommend this brand..	1
I have a 47 & # 34 ; TV and had no place to put it in my bed room . With this mount it use the space i had a poster hanging . Very easy to install , came with all hard ware .	1
Perhaps I misunderstood how to install the mount , but I:1 ) Installed the mount to the wall ( easy enough ) 2 ) Attach TV the mount with some screws ( difficult for one person ) With one arm I held the TV ( heavy ! ) . The other arm was trying to attach some small screws connecting the TV to the mount . It took quite an effort to hold the TV for that long . Certainly having two people installing this would be waaaay easier : - ) I have another similar mount where the TV back plate and the mount are separate parts . So once the back plate is installed , you slide the connecting parts together . Much easier ! : - )	1
The VideoSecu line of articulating wall mounts has become our standard of choice for high quality articulating wall mounts within our home . The value is such that the convenience of having an articulating wall mount for connecting or reconnecting cables is well worth the few bucks required to mount our HDTVs conveniently to the wall . Highly recommend this great quality product . This wall mount will secure any of the HDTVs using the VESA 100 or VESA 200 mount pattern . We like to use a mount on the larger end than actually needed so if we later upgrade the HDTV with a larger size there 's a much better chance we wo n't need to replace the articulating mount .	1
you can spend a ton of money on one of these , or you can buy this one . hung a 32 inch tv with it with no problems .	1
Amazon as always 5 stars in service and shipping.The mount was for a VIZIO E260MV 26-Inch . Product comes adequate with a lot of screws , an Alan key and standard nut key that fits all the nuts . The bubble level ( with magnet on the side ) and cable are a nice addition.Had to cut 1 inch from the top and bottom of the base that gets screwed no to the TV , since it covered some of the inputs . Other wise very practical for my bedroom/Study that has more width so the convenience of swirling is why we wanted this and it does a good job.For the price ( $ 25 and free shipping ) , its is a really good deal . Would recommend this .	1
Another gem hidden amoungst the Amazon halls . This works well for my LED tv 's . I used the heavy duty mount bolts for mounting my tv on the back porch . I hung on the sucker and it 's not coming down . And I 'm 190lbs !	1
quickly shipped to my house and mounted myself . i ordered this for my 32 inch Phillips LCD tv and for the price i paid its a great value . does the job that any other higher priced wall mounts can do . would recommand	1
Very good materials , very lightweight , cheaper than others brands . I have a 47 & # 34 ; LG Led tv and it fit at 100 % , and I 'm capable of sell my tv , buy an 55 & # 34 ; and use the same mount without problems .	1
This is possibly one of the best mounting kits I 've ever purchased . I like the fact that there are pieces so the mounting kit can cater to all models of TV . ( Whether they have a rounded or flat back ) . Mine had a flat back so I did n't need the extra piece , but once that step was cleared it was only a matter of minutes before it went up on my wall . The adjustable arm is nice , as it is setup in our bedroom . At night the TV is angled towards the bed and makes it super easy for both of us to see up on the wall , and during the day its turned in another direction towards my desk - also making the ability to view the TV while working.The material is very strong , hubby did a pull up on the bar and it did n't even budge . This thing seems as though it will last quite a long time . It 's already been up for over a month and it was a wonderful addition to my master bedroom , I 'll be purchasing more over time for the other rooms in the home with larger model TVs .	1
I bought three of these mounts for all the bedrooms in my house . I love all three of them . All mounts have different tv 's on them , One is a 50 & # 34 ; , 40 & # 34 ; and a 32 & # 34 ; . Product comes with multiple screw for different tvs . Outstanding product for the price . All tv 's have been mount for a little over a year . This product is a full motion mount for $ 29.99 ! ! and it is Prime !	1
Awesome price and quality . Simple and easy to install and fully equipped for installation . If you need a swing arm mount for medium size tv this is one I 'd recommend .	1
Used this for a Panasonic 32 '' LCD TV . Mount works fine , instructions were minimal . I was able to use the supplied hardware to attach the TV and to attach the mount to the wall . I did have a problem hanging the TV , per the instructions you have to mount the unit and now attach the TV , this was not very easy so I removed the mounting plate at the pivor point and took it off the wall mount , mounted this on the TV and now re-attached to the TV mount , this was a lot easier .	1
The TV is still hanging from the wall so that 's a good thing . The info for this wall mount says it is good for up to 66 LBS . Our old Phillips 37 & # 34 ; flat screen weighs 58 LBS ( including the stand ) and after 3 weeks the TV and mount are secured to the wall via a vertical 2 x4 & # 34 ; frame member . The mount came with almost every imaginable combination of nuts , bolts and spacers and straps to fit various size and brand TVs . I had no problem coming up with the right combination for my big and heavy old Phillips .	1
I have my 32 inch Tv on the wall and it works great . Easy to install and came with all the parts . The screws that it comes with for the TV will not fit but you can buy some for 2 dollars .	1
I have this mounted on my wall in my editing studio . It holds a 27 '' LCD monitor ( about 20-25lbs ) . It 's been up for a week and I do n't expect that it will fall down anytime soon .	1
It is a good value , but is not top notch quality . If you extend both arms in the same direction , the TV ( 30 inch ) tilts . However if the arm goes right , then left , the play in the hinges offset each other and it works great .	1
Very strong for any tv , but I wish that it was little longer I am very happy with it and very strongly recommended .	1
I wanted to put my mac in the wall and leave it . This does that well . I do n't move it often it seems strong and well built . If you want to move it a lot get something different you have to keep an Allen wrench and a crescent wrench in the desk drawer if you plan on moving it a lot . The articulation is sketchy . For my uses and the cheap price this was perfect .	1
I have purchased a total of 4 HDTV wall mounts from the VideoSecu companyand they are all quality products at a very reasonable price.-Tilt TV Mount : for stationary TVs up to 65 inches.-Articulating : corner mount for SMALL TVs-Long Arm : corner or high mobility mount for LARGER TVsAll of them are excellent products , and very easy to install .	1
The directions stink . Just remember the spacers go under the arms if you have to use them and you will be ok .	1
Good quality . Must mount on a stud . I mounted to a metal stud by cutting a rectangle hole in wall , adding a 2 ft 2x4 in the metal stud track , patched the hole and then put up the mount . Holds a 37 & # 34 ; TV without a problem , even added a DVD player to the bottom of the TV and it is still on the wall after about 8 months . Price on this item was great and it was sent with FREE FREIGHT !	1
Very simple set up and ease of installation . I followed the advice of another reviewer and removed the top hex-screw of one of the center connections ( thus disconnecting the wall plate from the plate attached to the TV ) so that I could install the plate to the wall and the plate to the back of the TV as separate processes . Both simple and quite easy . Then it was simply a matter of slipping the two back together and re-installing the hex-screw . I was able to install a 32 '' RCA TV , without any help in less than 20 minutes.Manufacturer provided a good assortment of screws and other hardware , as well as a hex wrench , a small open wrench and a level .	1
got this to hang a 32 '' sony lcd in my bedroom . used my stud finder to locate the studs , drilled 6 pilot holes and hung it up . and extra set of hands is helpful when hanging the mount and mounting the tv . holes on mount lined up perfectly with my tv . screws fit just right.no complaints .	1
This TV mount is easy to install . Just follow the directions included . I installed this near the ceiling and I 'm using every bit of the 15 degree downward tilt . Properly installed , the product is rock solid . I installed a 32 '' tv on it . I know it can hold much more . The articulating arms are easily adjustable and if you want to tighten it down and lock it in position you can do that , too .	1
Its sturdy , holds my tv really good , its adjustable & really really easy to install . An excellent product . I would definitely recommend it .	1
Months later , I am still happy with this Tablet , but you should know 2 things . One is , you 'll get it for $ 224 if you 're a B & N ; member . Also , if you go online , often they have a deal such that if you buy a year 's subscription to the NY Times , they reduce the price of the Tablet . To get the member 's discount , you 're better off going to a B & N ; store . BUT THE BIG THING is , if you already own Kindle books , Barnes and Noble stupidly do n't provide a Kindle app , HOWEVER , you can buy the cheapest n2a card , either on Amazon or on n2a.com . This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet ( like the $ 500 ones ) , and you can get the Kindle app on that . There 's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook . Since , as noted below , the Nook eReader is beautifully designed , much better in my opinion than any Kindle , so I use my n2a card only when I 'm reading a Kindle book . I find B % N and Amazon charge about the same for books . There are some books on Nook that Kindle does n't have , and some on Kindle that Nook does n't have . However , only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video , audio clips , and animations.One other thing : the Nook has a tab for `` My Stuff '' so you can download music , pictures , videos and documents easily onto the Nook . You do n't have to buy music for it . Use what 's on your PC or what you rip from disk . I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures . For that , I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app . I do n't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire . I do n't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire . However , I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16 , 2012 . Then came days of comparing them side by side . You can see my review of the Fire on its page 's customer reviews , so , how about the Nook ? First of all , if you want one , get it from Barnes and Noble . It cost $ 199 with a year 's subscription to the NY Times . Even without that discount , it costs $ 249 with free shipping ( and , this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $ 149 ! ) Hands down , for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook . Some reviewers say they 're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features . I have no quarrel with that , but you pay for those features . Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets -- I 've tried them out , too . However , the Sony is on sale for $ 399.99 this month , and the 32 bit is on sale for $ 499.99 . Comparing it side by side with the Nook , the Sony salesperson said , `` Wow ! it 's as good as the Sony ! '' Yes , and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony does n't have the Netflix app , which comes with the Nook . Of course , Sony wants you to buy their movies . Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books , which is fine for a Bookaholic like me . B & N ; has 2,500,000 titles available , over 1,000,000 free . Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books , Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free . They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books . What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw , brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books . You 'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions , not $ 3.99 . Many children 's classics are in this series , but also adult books , like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text . Some of the old books are also Enhanced . Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined . You touch them , and can see what the original had . One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka . You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned , or of a notable person he 's alluded to . In general , eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web . You read in more depth , and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience . The Nook 's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks : Look up and Google ( or Wikipedia ) .The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook . Pictures , videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook , which has built-in folders for each , and , if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is not enough for you , you can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That 's not all ! If you 're App happy , you can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet , which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty . I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook , with new ones being added each week . Truthfully , if it 's apps that are what you want most in a tablet , the way to go is the iPad -- for $ 600- $ 700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet . Many of her friends have iPads ; however , she says , she can get the same apps as her friends do . Using the Drawing app , she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail . She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook . I ca n't comment . Angry Birds do n't tempt me , but I do play some games on my Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time , but with the money you save by buying the Nook , you can get an iPhone which does have both . If you want features like that in a Tablet , it costs $ 500 or more plus monthly data fees . No data fees with the Nook , of course , although you can browse the Web with ease and speed , depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook . The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is . I 'm in a rural area with no 4G , but I still get crisp , clear movies with my wifi device . Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu , Smithsonian , Showtime , and Netflix . There may be more sources of flicks on it , but , truthfully , I have n't looked -- and , since they add apps every week , you have to keep looking.If , like me , your primary use for a Tablet is reading , the Nook is tops . Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive . It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on . Notice , it displays page numbers , not `` locations '' like the Fire . If you ca n't remember who a character is , put your finger lightly on the name . 5 popups show instantly . Touch Find , and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on , complete with it sentence . ( You can do this with place names as well . ) The other choices are Highlight , Note , Share , Look Up . The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts -- not social networking sites . For those , you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen . My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me . Of course , I choose those that are witty or relevant to a discussion we 've had . Other reading options are Go to Page , Back , Find ( for when you want to type in the search screen ) , Contents , Text options , Brightness and Discover . This last shows you other books on the subject you 're reading about or by the same author.In short , as an eReader , the Nook is tops . As a Tablet , it does well , although not as well as those that are way more expensive . Actually , everything it does do , it does very well . It just does n't have certain features -- but that is true of every Tablet I 've seen except the iPad . As of now , the iPad 's picture quality is not as good as the Nook 's or , for that matter , the Fire 's . The iPad3 will have hi def , however .	1
I bought this ebook ( 16G ) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email . It does the jobs well until now . I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance . With low price , fast response , and light weight , book size , and Barn and Nobles support , It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children . but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire . It could not be generally true , but based on the displayed tablets , I had to choose the nook.Until now , I have had mainly happy experiences with it . It has apps for children , one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most . My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up , and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow . After you turn it off and restart it ( hold the power button for seconds for on and off ) , it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes . It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars , but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children . Wonderful ! The American history app is excellent too , It costs me 1 dollar or so ( not remember exactly now ) .Problems : It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running . After the battery was charged for a whole night , it still refused to start . When I tried again in the afternoon , it started but took more than 10 minutes . I guess the software was damaged and repaired . It is now as good as it was before . I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV . only one or two of my children can use it in the same time . We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books . but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version . I would rather buy some hard copies instead . However , one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each . She is happy with the books.As a summary , the machine is excellent , sturdy , fast , and convenient for emails and web browsing . The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books . Apps for children are wonderful . My children love it .	1
The nook tablet is great.I have used it to check e-mail , browse and look at books , and also transferred one from my p.c.I like the way it will sync with the direction its rotated , and I love the touch screen.Thanks Amazon !	1
I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet ! I know that Amazon is `` enemy territory '' , but the NT does a much better job of meeting my needs than would a Kindle Fire.Not only can I use my NetFlix account but I also have full access to the Amazon Prime website to watch films and videos ! The screen is incredible - bright and colorful and very fast due to both the fast processor and the full Gig of RAM . I popped-in a 16G micro SDHC card and have more than enough room for my entire library of sideloaded epubs , pdfs , mp3s , and mp4 videos.And , of course , the primary use : It 's now much easier to read in bed at night . The backlit screen means no more glare from an external reading light .	1
I 'm happy , satisfied and proud of myself by selecting such a wonderful tablet like my NOOK . Honestly it worths more than a five star rating.I will recall a phrase in a movie , it came to a certain point when I had to decide between style and substance ... That 's right ! I got both on this Tablet.The product arrived two weeks ago , I did charge the battery and afterwards registreded the product so I immediately starting getting books , nowadays I have plenty of Nook Books to read ahead.My co-workers and friends love the aesthetics of the Nook look , as I love all the features in the device.Pros : All of them.- The screen is so clear ( `` Wows ! '' me all the time ) , fast response to tasks , easy menu , fast processor , Micro SD card slot added 32GB extra fun ( big smile ) , lightweight , long life battery . etc.Cons : None	1
my wife was tired of dragging books around she loves the covienence of the tablet and can make the text larger	1
I bought the Nook primarily for reading but wanted the HD for email and web browsing also . I was pleasantly surprised at the exceptional screen quality and ease of setup.I did not want to spend the money for an IPAD and now I am glad I did n't as I prefer the Nook interface for reading . The screen brightness can be changed anytime during reading but on the IPAD you have to go into settings after exiting the book you are reading . The only downside is there are not as many apps written for the Nook . I am hoping that will change .	1
My nook tablet has really made reading fun again ! I was sick and tired of fiddling with reading lights while trying to read in the dark and , after seeing my friend 's kindle fire , decided to pick up a tablet for myself . The barnes and noble app market is a bit weak , but I bought my nook to read , so aside from a few games and basic applications its been a strictly literary experience for me . The backlight is great for reading in the dark , and i have n't had any issues with glares while reading in the sun . The stock web browser is fine for basic browsing , but if you 're looking for a true tablet experience you might want to wait for the Google Nexus 7 tablet . The nook tablet however , as it stands , is an excellent e-reader/tablet for $ 200 !	1
I have mixed feelings about the tablet . I really like and do n't like features of this tablet . I 'm keeping my fingers crossed that later versions improve the potential of the Nook.LIKE:1. layout and function of touch screen is intuitive - the Kindle Fire requires instruction2 . built-in wi-fi3 . the hardware is solid4 . the price is competitive5 . Netflix and Hulu are available and app market is expandingDO N'T LIKE:1. no bluetooth or GPS2 . do not have access to the full Android Market3 . no video rental option - apple and Amazon tablet have better market places4 . only 8 GB memory and although it can be expanded with microSD , less convenient than other tablets5 . the e-reader is not as good as a Kindle but then what is ? at least the iPad allows for the Kindle appFor now , I 'm sticking with my Kindle Fire over this Nook but I 'm keeping my options open for future purchases .	1
I assumed that I had the 16gb model but the box was misbranded and my bad for not paying attention , too late to take back to the store but it is still a very good tablet and the memory can still be expanded by sd card . I have since rootedmy tablet and it is great ! I do have the 16gb one after all .	1
This is very amazing . It has a ton of features and has a great looking VividView touchscreen . Here are some of the features and things it can do.-Very strong , I dropped mine from 5 feet to wood floor and it was fine.-Very fast but slow at navigating the home screen.-Has a physical home button which comes in handy in case you want to quit something.-Has expandable memory so you can have tons of content on this.-You can personalize the home screen with your own wallpaper.- Loads pages fast and plays videos well.-Has a VividView touchscreen which does what it says and makes everything vivid.-The os is tweaked which is nice if you do n't care about android.-The microphone works great .-It has physical volume buttons.Over all this is a very good tablet if you just need to do basics like read , email , play games , play videos and search the web . It can also do more than basics .	1
This tablet from barnes and noble is an afforadable alternative to the ipad . Serves more than one purpose ... while its primary function is reading . The original nook is a whole family experience . Its size and durability give the nook , nook color , and nook tablet are built with quality materials so that they have longevity . This is a gift for the teachers assistant at my sons school . She wanted something to read her books on , and since i have the nook color i figured this would be a good start for her.Barnes and Noble NOOK eBook Reader ( WiFi only ) [ Black & White ]	1
I bought this on the 27th of December after hassling with FedEx ( to the point where I made them just hold it at a FedEx office ) 2 days later I finally have it after ( It was attempted for delivery on Friday 1/6 ) I was pleasently surprised to discover how small this thing is . I 've watched a ton of reviews and unboxing a on it and I guess the camera angles made it look wider . It 's so tiny it can fit in a larger pocket ( Like pajama pockets ) . I already have 12 books and I actually finished one just now I started reading it at 1:30pm and it 's 11:45pm I say not bad the book was 155 pages too . Once I got the hang of it I was very pleased with my purchase and I recommend probably just getting the Nook Simple Touch but coming down to reading it does n't matter just read people ! That 's a little rant . So I 'll maybe give another in depth review of this in a week . See you soon , thanks for reading my review .	1
When I first heard about e-book readers , I was skeptical and did not want to give up my precious collection of books . ( I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me ! ) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night , and due to being away from home for periods of time where I could n't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin ' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad . I was excited about that one , but the price was WAY out of range . I decided to try and go with the Nook ( after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option ) and I was so thrilled with it , I had nothing bad to say . I used that little beauty for a few good years , until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills . From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it . I was certain I 'd never find one that good again . And I do n't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still ! Fast-forward to this Black Friday . The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend ! And I am looking for a really good e-reader ! I did come across the Nook on Amazon , and saw the new Nook Simple Touch , which intrigued me , because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display , and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer . Finally , I realized my love for the original Nook had never died , and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader . I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon , who lived less than half an hour away from me , and it only cost me $ 50 ! ! ! I was SOOOOO excited ! ! Now , if only I had NOT wasted $ 5 on that stupid fake-leather black cover , that completely RUINED the casing on my Nook ... : (	1
High Points : -Easy to read screen-Touchscreen responsive-Love the physical page turning keys on either side ( wish the NookColor had this feature ) -Size ( can hold it easily in one hand ) -Lots of Free Classic Books and Classic Books available for 99 cents-Easily transfer books from your library from device to device ( any Nook device or device with a Nook App ) -Very organized library ( and easy to pick up where you left off no matter how long the Nook has been turned off ) -Beautiful design & feels very sturdy and well made-Great accessories-Battery Life ( charge lasts about 10 days if you have it on with the internet off for a few hours everyday-MUCH better than the NookColor which gets about 3 days with comparable usage ) -eLend compatible with your local library if they offer that feature ( which is the only reason I chose this over the Kindle ) -Free Updates ( as the software improves , you wo n't have to buy a new device to get the upgrades , like faster page turning , better internet experience , etc ) -Free eBook Fridays via the Barnes & Noble storeLower Points : -Delay between turning the page ( not a deal breaker by any means but there is a flash everytime you turn the page , which I personally do n't like ) -Weight ( you get used to it , but it could be lighter ) -Browsing the internet and playing games via the tiny touchscreen is cumbersome . Not to mention the internet function is quite basic and everything is of course in einkConclusion : If you do n't have to have a color screen or a touchscreen and just want an eReader , I think this is a great choice . I love some of the features on this and think they should have been on the NookColor . I definitely read a lot more books now and it 's easy to take with me everywhere I go .	1
I have n't really given up my Kindle ( which I love and has its advantages ) . However , I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump . If you 're wondering if it 's worth 2X the price , IMO it depends on your needs and wants . For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It 's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover . The battery life means you CA N'T be far away from an electrical plugin . My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games , an animated screensaver and some reading . It 's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected . However , I find that finding ebooks on B & N ; 's site is harder than Amazon and I can not find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle . Lots of ebooks promoted on B & N ; 's Nookstore are $ 4.99 - $ 9.99 or more . Too expensive , IMO . Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $ 2.99 price range : ( I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card ( I used a 2G card ) . It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total . I am not a major Geek , but I 've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML ( not needed for this ) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck . The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky . While the original B & N ; e-reader functionality is still there , I had to install a couple apps ( launcher app and Softkeys ) to toggle between the Android and B & N ; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily . I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook , and read my 100+ Kindle books on it ( and get my freebies too ! ) . You ca n't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix ( yet ! ) , but maybe flash will work with the next B & N ; update . note that a Nook Color does n't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps . A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance 's FlexT9 app.Overall , my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color , and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen . So now we fight over it . Will I get rid of my Kindle -- no way . But I find the Nook Color becoming more my at home reader with the Kindle app on it , and my Kindle device turning into an away from home , travel e-reader .	1
Before I get started , I 'll just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display . The overall product will still be the same , but some things ( like the instruction manual ) might be different. -- -- -- -- -Reading : It 's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen is n't too annoying , but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later . If you 're looking to buy this for reading at length , you 'll need to be aware of this . You can change the brightness of the page , but that does n't change that ultimately you 're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading : Pretty fast download times , although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront . ( Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront 's B & N . ; We 're so going to lose money on ebook sales . ) Internet : Pretty decent . I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp , clear & loads quickly . I also went onto failblog , a site with quite a few side ads . It was a little on the slow side , but that 's to be expected on stuff like this . You can also pull up videos on youtube , so that 's a bonus.Battery : Not bad , but obviously wo n't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there . You 'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on . Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now , but since the company says it 's 8 hours I 'd say it 's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras : You can change the font , screen background color , & a few other things . While that 's nice , I could n't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it . There 's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice . You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor , which is a nice touch . Since we 're not supposed to change that with our store unit , I was n't able to play with that any.Touch Screen : It 's OK . Pretty easy to use , but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages . Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I 'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be . Not a deal breaker , though . It did n't happen enough to where I 'd get overly irritated , but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly : It 's not very intuitive to use . People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything . The unit for my store did n't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit . That means that if it 's like this on the sale unit then that wo n't be all that helpful for the people who are n't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall : My opinion is that it 's OK , but not exceptionally so . Go for the iPad if you really want something like this . ( I know it 's more expensive , but if you 're willing to pay $ 300 then paying $ 500 might not be that much of a difference . ) It 's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid , but without the option for all of the extras & apps . ( Of course if all you want is an e-reader & would n't use the iPad 's extras , then this is great . ) Overall it is n't a bad unit but it just does n't have anything to really make it stand out . If you 're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit , but I 'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market . While the color option is great for children 's books & magazines , this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store , but I do n't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook . Of course this is just my opinion , but again- before making a big purchase like this , view a unit in the store first.3.9/5	1
I bought this used but I was pleasantly surprised that it was like new . I rooted it and made itA Droid pad . I 'm using it right now to write this . I like it better than my ipad .	1
I have had this a few days and I love it ! It arrived earlier than expected which is a plus ! I have never had a nook before so I 'm unsure whether my problem is an issue with my nook or all nooks but the power/sleep button on the back is loose feeling and is hard to press . Other than that , I have barely put this thing down since it arrived ( : good thing I 'm on winter break from school !	1
We have only been using the product for a couple of weeks now , but it is working great . My wife and my daughter both love it and find it very easy to use .	1
I 've had all the other Nook 's and this is the first that I truly love . The touch screen is accurate and quick , there is no reflection at all , page turns are quicker than the other Nooks . It 's very light , the archiving and rating process is much much easier . Shopping is easier as well . I 'm in love with my Kindle and always compared the Nook , now I love them equally . Of all the Nooks , I think this is the best one , I love it . I only wish it was 3g . Barnes and Noble still seems to have an issue with the syncing of books between the readers . When I read on this Nook ( just like the other 2 ) , it does n't sync with online so when I then use my Iphone I 'm not at my current page . In this area , the Kindle and Amazon know what they are doing . I 'm not terribly impressed with the choice of covers for this new Nook . I 'm waiting patiently for M-Edge to release their new covers so that I can use my M-Edge light with both my Nook and Kindle .	1
I have owned my nook for two months now and am very happy with it . My mom owns a Kindle , one sister a Nook Color , another sister a 1st Edition Nook ... so I 've seen my fair share of e-readers . I did the research before I bought . I actually bought my dad a Kindle 3G for Father 's Day . But the light weight of the Nook Touch was great for me . I have problems with my hands and their abilities , so after a full day of commuting , typing , and writing , they 've reached their peak . It was the right choice for me .	1
I bought it and love it.The Good StuffThe UI is a lot better than the Kindle ( I bought one for my brother , so I felt the difference between them ) , it 's really confortable to hold and read , the touch is great for navigating between de UI , but the physical buttons are my choice , takes a little time to get used to it because they are not as sensitive as the Kindle ones ( that are too sensitive , I mean the basic edition ) , but that 's a good thing since I avoid turn pages accidentaly.The structure is lightweight and really confortable , unlike Kindle , the frame around the screen es wide enough to put my fingers on it to read ( I have large hands ) , the grip is great thanks to the rubberized exterior . It 's a pleasure to read on this thing.The Not so Good StuffNot sharing on sideloaded content . If I sideload a book from other store , the sharing option gets unavailable.Not that many formats . Just Pubs and PDF . I mostly read Pub files , but it would be great if they support other formats too.Not `` send to '' option . In kindle I fell in love with the option to push content to the device via wireless . This thing does n't have a feature like that , so WiFi is not as usable as it is on the Kindle.Overall a great product , I liked it more than the Kindle mainly because is a lot more confortable to read , better ergonomics , and the UI makes it feel a lot better .	1
I know Amazon is going to hate me for this but here goes : I used to have a Kindle 3 . It was great . It made reading a pleasure however there were a couple of things I would have liked to change . I wished that it had a touch screen and that it was smaller.When I saw the Nook Touch I thought that this is what my Kindle should be like . Well I decided to buy the Nook and I 'm very , very pleased . I wo n't go into an in depth review of the device itself . You can find that just about anywhere . What I will say is the touch screen makes things so much easier . I love the on screen virtual keyboard ( like the ipad ) and the fact that it 's a lot smaller than the Kindle 3 but with the same size and quality screen.Since giving the Kindle to a relative I thought about the books that I already bought from Amazon and the fact that I now have to use my Android phone to read them since the Nook does not read Kindle books ... ... or does it ? ? With a little research I was able to find out how to root my Nook Touch ( voids your warranty ) . Now when I turn on the Nook , it gives me a dual boot screen ( sort of ) . I can go to the Android desktop or the the Nook screen . Using the Android desktop which included the Android market I downloaded the Kindle reading app . I ran that app , logged into my Kindle account and now have all my Kindle book available on my Nook Touch . The only thing missing is text to speech but I did n't use that feature anyway . Yes it has a web browser , email and all the other Android apps available but most look pretty drab on a monochrome device . That is n't why I did this . I wanted a device to read my Nook Books and Kindle books.I now have the best of both worlds .	1
Personally , I 'm a kindle fan . But I got the Nook to try out the ebook loan facilities from libraries . The layout and user interface is not as user friendly as the kindle , as on the kindle , pressing the home button brings us back to the library . On the Nook , the home button opens a menu , then you need to select the options . Also , if you sort the books by & # 34 ; Recent & # 34 ; it does not show the most recently read books in order , but still displays books in order of & # 34 ; recently downloaded & # 34 ; , not a useful function.But on a positive note , the Nook combines the touch facilities and button control ( to turn the pages ) of both the Kindle Touch & normal kindle . The borrowing of ebook a from public libraries is done on your PC , then imported onto the Nook via Adobe Digital Editions . A bit of a hassle , but a good option which Kindles do not offer . Overall , it 's a good companion to Kindle , especially if you wish to borrow library books .	1
I waited until June 2010 until I bought a nook . So far I am loving it . I love the page turning swipe feature . Those that gave the nook 1 star are the ones who got theirs with the 1.1 firmware . The firmware is now up to 1.4 and the price has dropped to $ 199 .	1
I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa , more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops . I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device , because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived . During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf 's that I have amassed over the years ( over 30GB - I am a voracious reader ) . A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued , after which I decided to take the trip again ( I live outside of the USA ) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise , they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device 's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues . I was refunded for all the items ( Nook , cover case and screen protector ) in no time at all.So , in summary , the Nook gets a ZERO star in my review for paying more attention to the esthetics rather than the functionality of the reader , but B & N ; gets a FIVE star rating for their approachability and for their great costumer service !	1
So , I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this , or buying the kindle.I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more , and I travel a lot and do n't have house wi-fi . I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B & N ; and ca n't believe I ever did that ! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore , with my nook and feel connected to the actual store . I will admit you have to do your research ( read forums , articles etc ... ) because the nook demo employees , are not going to know everything . Also you MUST read the 'manual ' and follow it to a 'T ' Do n't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you 're going to have battery issues ( needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity ) A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen ' when actually the battery is drained , and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver , book page etc you were on when it died . There 's no 'power-down ' it will just stop , and touchscreen will not be active , once you plug it up and charge it a little , it will be good again . Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster ( obvious unfortunate fact ) There are a lot of books available at the moment ( depending what genre you read ) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction ( my books ) , and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features ' for a good portion of the books I was interested in . Also B & N ; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades ( faster page turning , less freezing etc . ) Also even when there was a manufacturing error , they were quick to send out a new improved nook . Overall , I love this device , it 's fun , its sleek with a solid feel , and it 's open-ended for future updates.It may be for you , it may not . Do your research , read forums and reviews , go into the respective stores and hold and try the device.Pros : Removable/replaceable batteryReally crisp 'paper ' and 'words'e-wish list for booksSD card slotAudio/ musicFree coupons , discounts , and food monthly via nooke pub librarygetting books from Sony ADELending featureConsBattery lasts an average of 7-8 daystouchscreen keyboard a bit small ( if you 're used to iphone/ipod ) touchscreen may be over sensitive with accidental touchSmall price differences with kindle books ( average of a dollar )	1
I 've researched the readers for about two years.I only buy electronics after I can give the item a test drive . Upon that note , I have always been a huge fan of Amazon.For the first time I could not go to a store and compare prices and see the item in question.The nook was available to be put through anything I wanted to try . First of all the new Nook in stores has the most recent upgrades . No problem with turning the page at all , touch screen worked great . In the store I downdoaded a book in under 1 minute and have downloaded 3 books at home that are nearly 1000 pages long in under 1 minute.The nook can connect to your computer ( as does the Sony ) . You can also download from other sources other than the dealer.The nook also downloads without any effort wi-fi ( as does the Kindle ) .The nook 's battery you can change at home . It also accepts a memory card , which allows you to expand your book collection.The Nook also has other advantages , but I was only wanted a reliable reader.Barnes and Noble has a home run with the nook because it combined the features of the sony and the kindle in one very neat package .	1
I got my Nook Wi-Fi/3G about 2 months ago , and I love it ! I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook ; in fact , I originally bought a Kindle from a local store , but never took it out of the box , and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons ; 1 ) I was n't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook , and 2 ) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere . And I 've been glad I chose that ; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi . I was at a doctors office recently , waiting and waiting and waiting , and it was wonderful to be able to shop , buy a book , and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great , all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook . Also , the store nearest me has `` classes '' on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners , and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store , I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store . That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a `` free sample '' and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I 've looked at the newest generation Nook , which has just recently become available , and I 'm glad I got my Nook when I did ; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I 've looked at . I can drop my nook in my purse , and anytime I 'm stuck somewhere and want to read , I 've got a whole library right there with me . The Nook is awesome ! ! !	1
I have been super happy with this reader . In the bright sun sitting outside , no problem . On the many flights I take , no problem . B & N ; site and downloading books is a breeze . I 've got a Droid X phone , and the accounts sync , so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App , very cool.I can lend , and have others lend me , some of the books purchased.Our local library in Central Texas , outside Austin , is connected to Overdrive.com . With my library card I can download epub books and check them out , anywhere I 've got internet . I do n't have to check them back in , they just go away after the check out period . Same with Audiobooks . Nook handles this format , other eReaders do not , so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen , personally . It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen . Seems like no big deal , but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed . This is a personal opinion , and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard . I put in pagemarks etc on books , but do n't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading . If you do a lot of this , you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it . I do n't , the amount of typing is very limited , so onscreen is perfect and I 'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do , but it is n't the best . You can in a pinch , but it 's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books , especially free ones , is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats . B & N ; just search 0.00 and titles and you 'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free . gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free , google books does this and a few other sites . Tons and Tons of books for free , I have n't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now , for free . Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals , newspapers etc , that you can get daily.I take my kids into B & N ; and they love to look through the kids books . While there , I can read any book over their Wifi for free for up to an hour . I do n't use this a lot , but once a month or so when I take the kids , it 's pretty cool.Overall , I 'm really pysched , this Nook has been awesome .	1
The Nook is the best e-reader yet . It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display . This makes it easy to maneuver between the store , your library , your current book , the daily ( with messages , newsletters , and other free content ) , and settings . The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed , and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds , and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B & N ; store . I 'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews . Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip . Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person . The back is removable and replaceable with different colors . They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop . Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable . The e-ink display is the same type , but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2 . The nook supports EPUB ( Non or Adobe DRM ) , PDB ( Non DRM ) , PDF , Graphics : JPG , GIF , PNG , BMP , Audio : MP3 , PDB . The online B & N ; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that , the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary : While it costs the same as the Kindle , the nook is loaded with extra features : WiFi , color LCD , removable battery , expandable memory , more open book formats . You can customize your nook with your own photos to create personal screen savers and lend between nook , iPhone , a PC and a Mac .	1
It 's a fine tablet . The screen is excellent . The speakers are very good . The interface is a little clunky but easy to use . It does just what I want it to do and it does it well .	1
She has been using a Nook e-reader for several years . I decided to get her the tablet because she wants to read email and browse as well as read her ebooks . Her little smart phone was just too small to use . Now she 's using it regularly to browse and can easily read her gmail .	1
This is a very good tablet for reading..satisfied with my purchase..very handy and easy to tucked in your purse or in your hands..just convenient for my need..	1
I got one of these for Christmas , and I LOVE it ! At first I was n't all that fond of it because the only way to purchase apps and such was to use the nook store , but recently they had an update that added all sorts of Google apps , including Google Playstore . It has great graphics compared to previous nook tablets . It is great to read with , but the books are a little pricey.Now that it has Google Playstore and great graphics , I ca n't think of a reason for somebody NOT to get it !	1
I 've bought a few Nooks over the years and have always loaded CyanogenMod ( plain Android ) off an SD card ( and a few times on the actual device ) .The HD+ is no exception . As long as you understand that it does n't have a camera , its powerful and inexpensive . It even comes with Google Play ! East your hear out Kindle users ! Up for your own project ? Head over to the XDA developer forums and find out how to load a clean version of Android either right on the device or run it off a microSD card.Great screen , fast processor . This thing still has enough power to run the latest apps and Android OS !	1
Well , I bought it because of the 1080p resolution . The screen quality is beautiful . I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad , but I could n't resist on the high quality picture and low price . After I received the Nook , I immediately rooted with Kit Kat , the latest operating system . Let me tell you , I am glad that I made the move . The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat . With Kit Kat , not only the Nook operates much more smoothly , you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store . With this app , I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free . I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi , though the Cine Player version 's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi , it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something . With Kit Kat , I experience very little buffering issue . I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter . I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I have n't tried it yet so I ca n't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS . I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way , I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+ 's . With a N2A micro SD card , it gives you the dual boot capabilities . You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card . The N2A card does n't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you do n't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line , the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet . One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS . If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you , the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad . By the way , I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $ 16 and it works like a charm with the Nook . One can expect to spend $ 100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device does n't come with an internal GPS .	1
Got this for my nook ( since B & N did n't have it ! ) Good price and exactly what I needed . It also seems to be a better made product than the one that came with my color nook .	1
I had the original adapter that came with my Nook Color for 2 years without any problems . After 2 years it finally broke , and I did n't even know people were having troubles with their chargers until I had to buy a new one . I have had this one for at least a couple weeks now and again I do n't seem to be having any problems with it.The original charger that did finally break was because of the area where it plugs into the system though , which is where everyone is having problems . So I will not deny that this seems to be an issue . For that it loses a star , but because I personally have n't had any major problems with them I will still give it 4 stars .	1
The original chargers I had for the Nooks were dying , as in literally falling apart after a couple years . Hopefully these replacement chargers will last just as long , if not longer .	1
Wire is heavy grade , but as with all cables you ca n't really tell how strong the connectors are till they break .	1
Purchased this a few years ago and forgot to write a review . Needless to say I 'm still using it and have no problems . I purchased this back when the cheapest HDMI cord was $ 30.00 . Great buy , I recommend it .	1
Money well-spent . I love this little speaker/microphone . The sounds is very clear . Volume buttons work great , and the microphone is great ! ! ! I love this item ! ! !	1
Nice construction and nice labeling so you do n't use it for the wrong thing . It does the job and for only three bucks , you ca n't go wrong .	1
I have been using this alot , converting old video tapes , VHS , and tv into online videos . Anything you can play on your vcr , from tapes or tv , it can record .	1
I bought it to create dvds from home vhs video . Had to upgrade my pc to a faster cpu to avoid jittery recording . After that it work as described . Delivery was fast .	1
I must add this review since this is a great product at a ridiculously low price.I needed a CD/DVD player to install programs to my new netbook . Installation was easy ; just pluged in the two usb cables and it worked immediately.I upload Microsoft Professional Office 2007 quickly and easily . It does play movies , I played my Harry Potter Movie with no problems . The VLC media player was already installed . I highly recommend this player	1
Works as advertised . I needed a replacement for the internal drive on my Lenovo Y510 which had failed . Since the failure on the internal drive had happened before , I did n't want to deal with that again . Having an external drive is a little unhandy but once the OS had been loaded on it , an internal drive would be rarely needed .	1
I had a small notebook computer which had no internal DVD/CD drive so I purchased this . I have used it to run and install countless programs and not once has it ever given me trouble . I have also installed and played many games and it has a fast read speed and gets the job done in a timely fashion , I highly recommend .	1
i bought this to replace another external drive that was only a dvr ( i needed a cd/cdrw/dvd ) . i opened my very carefully wrapped and packaged drive and was pleased to see that it stated cd/cdrw/dvd right on the front of it ! i was unsure of the 2 cords as well , but i plugged them both into my dell netbook , and it worked right away . the only thing i do n't like is that when you eject , you have to kind of pull the tray out . it also seems just a tad sensitive if you touch it while it 's working . other than that , a great deal and good product !	1
Basic dvd player for the computer . Plug it in and it works . So far so good .	1
I bought this for my iPod 2G . I wanted to take advantage of Skype calling my family . The mic itself is small , about as big as a horse pill or a paperclip to you youngins who do n't know that a horse pill is any big a** pill you try to swallow ... LOL I have a little pouch in my purse I keep it in so I do n't lose it ... because you will lose it . The sound was good when I recorded a voice memo . But you have to remove it to hear anything back . THAT 's the kicker ! It 's a restriction of the device , not the mic . I thought I could use the mic to speak and my Bluetooth headphones to listen at the same time . No such luck . You have to get the iPod headphones with built in mic/recorder to do that . So all I can use this for is to record stuff and listen later . But it was cheap , so it 's still a cool addition to my toys . Oh , and I also got the iPod headphones with mic ... those too live in my little pouch of goodies ... LOL	1
This little microphone transforms my iPod into something much more useful for recording events . There is no way to listen at the same time , but that was advertised as such . Thank you .	1
i bought my mic from crazyfrog , not expecting that great of a mic due to the price . it shipped very fast , and i recieved it in perfect condition . it works just as well as , if not better than , my mic that came with an iphone . it works great with my ipod touch 2nd generation mc model . i would strongly advise anyone to buy this who 's looking for a high quality mic at a low price . dont let those bad reviews scare you ! ! i dont know about the quality from other sellers , but crazyfrog delivered mine in perfect condition . great buy .	1
It 's simple and works well for me . Sellers say you have to purchase an additional app , but mine works fine with the included 'Memo ' app on my iPod Touch 2G . Down side is that you have unplug it to listen to the recording .	1
Ordered Sept. 2012 from another company on Amazon for $ 5.24 which included shipping . I sent it with a gift to someone in the UK.Item is finished well , the different interlocking plugs cleverly designed and fit together snugly . Came with instructions and carrying pouch.Only trouble I had when testing it here before sending it was pushing my computer 's power cord plug into the AC receptacle . Very difficult at first to force it without it seeming it would break but after many tries finally got it . Much easier after that.The USB slot and its light worked , but the second light for the AC receptacle did not . However , the receptacle worked fine and charged my computer through it.The USB light did not go off when the device charging through it was fully charged . Also , another switch was shown in the instruction diagram ( I do n't remember what it was supposed to be for ) that was n't on the adapter.Recipient uses the USB slot to charge a camera and MP3 player and reports it is working fine for those devices . Thrilled to have the EU plug too.If it lasts , great product and VERY cost effective .	1
Cord worked great for awhile , but had recently not been working up to snuff . Ca n't understand how a cord like this can go bad in three months . It should last a lot longer than that . Wo n't keep my tablet fully charged when connected to the docking station . Switched back to the OEM cable , and what do you know ? It 's charging again.Definitely going to have to find a different cable.EDIT 10/1/2013 : Nope , the cable is fine . It works great as an OTG cable ... I was able to load pictures and sound effects onto my work phone , as well as add files to my Nexus 7 . It was actually the cheaply-made $ 9 Chinese charger I had purchased to use as a backup that was going bad . When I put this cable on my Nexus ' OEM charger , it worked just fine . I do believe I 'll be purchasing another Nexus 7 OEM charger in the near future .	1
It looks just like the real thing , however it does not hook into the port as well as the original one . Not a big issue considering the price.Google is selling those for way too much , they will not get my money for such overpriced item .	1
A big improvement from the stock cord provided with the device , liked it so much I am going to buy several more , because I take my nexus everywhere	1
Purchased this after the purchase of a camcorder that required it and would not work with a 16gig . Got the smaller card at local store because of price and wanted to compare Amazon first . Haft the price of buying it local so was worth the wait . Was in my hands a few days after ordering and would recommend that one at least look here before paying the box store price .	1
The micro sd card worked with no problem whatsoever . The adapter that came with it did not work at all . Luckily i had an extra .	1
I bought the 32 gig . card for just that purpose , My Samsung phone , takes as good pictures as most cameras . In fact I like the camera feature better than all the other stuff on the s-4 . I would buy it again and again if I needed a lot of memory . I recommend this item to anyone who has run out of memory for pictures or any thing that needs to be stored out from the internal memory of the camera . I like to take moving photos with my Samsung , and those 8 second runs take a lot of memory , now I do n't have to worry and running out of memory	1
Ordered this to leave connected to an HDMI port on the upstairs TV so my wife could connect her tablet to the TV . It works great and appears well made and should last a long time , especially where only the mini-HDMI connector will the inserted and removed multiple times . No issues with it being loose , weak , or ready to break . Hard to beat the price with a nominal shipping charge . It arrived in its own bag inside of a shipping bag in perfect condition , and the shipping was exactly when they said it would be .	1
this cable lets me show pictures and videos from my camera through my TV monitor . Easy to use . Clean picture . It does what it 's supposed to do .	1
Can view my pictures right from my Cannon 4Ti on my big screen TV with this . It works great , but be sure to follow Cannon 's directions . You must have the cable connected and have the TV on before turning on the camera . It is great to look at the pictures on the big screen before downloading them so you can pick the good pictures .	1
And I like the length ... .makes it much easier to make the connection between the cfamera and the TV . My TV is mounted high on the wall , so length is essential if the camera is not to be dangling . I have n't yet used the cable , but it appears to be strong and flexible .	1
its awsoooooooooome , i connect it with samsung LED and the picture is craaaaazy ` mashallah ` , i ` m very happy becouse this produce	1
THIS CABLE HAS GOOD CONSTRUCTION AND WORKS WELL WITH MY CANON 7D TO WATCH MOVIES FROM THE CF CARD ON THE CAMERA TO THE PANASONIC PLASMA HDTV.A GREAT PRICE FOR QUALITY AND THIS PARTICULAR KIND OF CABLE .	1
This is a nice cable for a good price . It works well with my Canon 300hs point and shoot camera , fits well and delivers a good picture . Sent to me in nice packaging on time .	1
This HDMI Cable works just fine . The price is so much lower than local retail stores . I recommend the site .	1
This cable works well with my T3i , this best thing is that it is 10ft . long so you do n't have to be right next to your tv to review your photos and video ... .	1
No problems running from computer to monitor , great value compared to other options and seems to be holding up just fine .	1
I bought this for my tablet that has a mini hdmi port it works 's excellent with my tablet the lengthily cable helps so that you can still control your tablet and this would be good for any other mini hdmi application you desire i definitely would recommend this product	1
this cable made it possible to connect my tablet to my big flat screen , so i could see videos better	1
Works fine when I use it to connect my android tablet to TV . Only used it 6or7 times but happy for now .	1
Canon wanted $ 70 for a similar cable , but I bought this cable for my Canon Rebel T1 digital SLR at this remarkable price . The cable is spectacular and my images and videos are very clear . The standard analog cable that was included with the Rebel is disappointing and there is a night and day difference between a digital signal and an analog signal . I 'm very pleased with my purchase .	1
... you can buy this 10foot cable for such a great price ? The length is great . It allows you to sit on the couch or recliner and view your photos and videos in comfort . I recommend this cable .	1
What is there to say ? I needed a cable to run from the camera to my TV and this is what was needed . It works as expected , and allows me to view my videos and pictures that are on my camera directly on my television .	1
On many cars the electric outlets turn off after a period of time when the car is turned off . So , if you want to charge from an electric outlet you need this charger . Works well and fast .	1
I bought two of these for use with two Garmin nuvi 1450 units . In my opinion , it is unfortunate that the Garmin nuvi 1450 requires extra storage capacity to handle updates ; I think they should have had at least enough storage capacity built into the original units to handle the United States and Canada . I do n't know yet whether I am going to need a bigger card soon to handle the updates and I do n't know whether a bigger card is available .	1
I have purchased many Kingston Micro Cards over time and have always found them reliable , fast and easy to handle . I use them on my GPS , HD video camera , Samsung tablet , laptops and including my desktop . I do not remember one failing me as they are totally reliable . That is important to me as I handle them a lot ... back and forth from my laptop and my other electronic equipment for my music , my guitar recordings , lyrics ... .etc . I have not hesitation to recommend them highly to others .	1
I have been trying to update my Garmin Nuvi 1450 with the latest maps for quite some time with no success . I had a 2GB Micro SD card installed in the Nuvi that showed a sufficient amount of free space to allow the update , but it would never complete the download . On an off chance I ordered this Micro SD and it worked perfectly the first time . I have no idea why the old card would not work , but now it does n't matter . For the low price and free shipping , this is a great deal .	1
I was not happy that I needed a micro card for my nuvi - I get lifetime maps but nowhere to put them , lol . and the card available through garmin cost three times the price of this one ! ! I was happy to find this at such a great price . It arrived quickly and works great . Thanks for saving my nuvi Kingston ! ! : )	1
How do audio cassettes load in your car 's cassette deck ? Do you insert them with the narrow side or the wide side ? The problem is that most cassette adaptors ca n't accommodate both types of cassette decks.With this Maxell adaptor , that is n't a problem . The great thing about this cassette adaptor is that the audio cable that leads out of it can be configured to exit from the narrow or wide side meaning no compatibility issues.NOTES -- -- -- -- -- -If you 're not hearing anything , try switching the audio cable to exit the cassette adaptor on the opposite side . In my Rav4 , cassettes load by inserting the narrow end . But since I did n't hear any audio , I thought this adaptor was broken . It turned out that if I made the audio cable exit on the *other* narrow end of the cassette , then there was no problem.Also try increasing the output volume of your iPod.TESTED WITH : -- -- -- -- -- -- A 2001 RAV4 and an iPod 30 gig and also an iPod Touch . They worked fine except for the set-up issue mentioned above .	1
This works great and saved me $ $ $ $ that a newer vehicle would have cost . Plug it in and listen to whatever you 've got on your phone or access stations through your phone . It 's fun to listen to foreign stations , etc .	1
I was force to buy this since the one that came with my Sony portable CD player and my cassette player in my car did n't get along ! I had one of these for years but time got the best of it . SO if I have to get another one , this was my only choice since it works without ANY drama !	1
I was pretty skeptical that this item would produce acceptable output through my Honda CR-V 's cassette player when connected to a Sansa Fuze . However , I was pleasantly surprised -- not only that the sound was acceptable , but it is actually quite good ! As a professional MIDI musician , I 'm pretty demanding in what I consider `` good '' ; this Maxell adapter far exceeds what I was expecting from this type of technology.I understand that there are going to be numerous variables in play with what every consumer can expect in the way of sound quality . Probably the largest factor is going to be the quality of the cassette deck that will be using the device , specifically , the playback heads . The results were n't quite as impressive in one of my in-home cassette decks , though still good.Another very important factor is the quality of the MP3 's being played ; the better the playback device , the more readily you 'll hear the shortcomings of a MP3 or other digital file . After all , some people are happy with 128 kbps MP3 's ( which are pretty low quality to begin with ) and none of my MP3 's are less than 256 kbps ... even those I 've purchased from Amazon.Overall , I 'm very happy with this device and consider it a very good , inexpensive alternative to having a dedicated LINE IN/LINE OUT option like those you find on newer in-car decks . Near CD-quality , to be sure .	1
This works great . It should n't be that difficult and it is n't . We used it to connect an iPod to my wife 's car stereo . The sound is just fine -- much better than an FM transmitter we used in the past .	1
I have a single CD plyer in my 2003 car . Never cleaned the lens the entire time I own it . Lately it 's been scratching my CDs , and frequently not playing them.Put this lens cleaner in . At first it was n't doing anything , but the CD player just spit the CD right out . Apparently the lens is really dirty . After a couple times of putting the CD back in I heard instruction in track 1 saying that tract 2 only needs to be played the minimum of 20 seconds to get the lense cleaned.My player required 5 playings of full tract 2 to function properly again.When I took the lens cleaner out , I see a lot of dust on the little brush , and on the bottom surface of the disk ( picked up by static ? ) . I think it has done its job , and now the CD player is playing my music again .	1
This arrived in only two days so I popped it in on the way to pick up the kiddos . This directions are on the disc and really simple . The cd makes an annoying beeping sounds while cleaning ( I turned the radio down and kept checking for it to finish ) but that is my only dislike . The packaging was very study . I will definitely buy from this seller again .	1
I just needed something , Any brand would have done . Worked great , helped alot and was pretty cheap . ( under $ 10 ) No Cons .	1
This is one of the best Dvd cleaners . I use it to clean my Sony Dvd burner head once a week .	1
I was having a lot of problems with my CD player skipping , refusing to play certain CDs , and randomly changing CDs . I thought I would have to replace it , which I did n't want to because it 's a high-end one , and I just love the sound quality . In the process of shopping for a new player , I came across information on CD lens cleaners . People were saying that they saved their CD player . Well , it 's true ! Do n't believe internet information that tells you that eventually the lasers give out ! My 12 year-old CD player just had a dirty lens , it was n't broken.This one has little brushes on the underside that clean off your laser lens . Some reviews indicated that this was the only one they tried that the CD player accepted , so that was the reason I picked this one.You put the CD in the player , in my case a 5 CD changer , and hit play . It then plays a little music and talks to you ! When it 's done cleaning your CD player lens it tells you and lets you continue for a sound system check - basically makes sure your speakers are hooked to the right channels . I was glad to hear that mine were indeed hooked up correctly.Tonight I put in a CD that had previously skipped or gotten stuck on a part of a song . Will wonders never cease ... it played perfectly ! Could n't ask for a better product . Saved me a ton of money on a new , high end ( I was going to choose a Yamaha ) player .	1
Worked as described . Cleaned the heads on my vcr/dvd player and the picture quality was better . Very easy to use .	1
Received the Maxell VCR Head Cleaner and loved it . I have always been leary of the dry ones ... .I have previously had these that had a built in button you pushed to put the cleaner on the cleaning tape . They were a very professional way to go and I loved them . This is about as close as you can get to that . I mostly use my professional vcr to convert my old videos to dvd 's so is nice to keep the heads clean so as to do a great job . I would recommend this to anyone ...	1
This was the perfect fix for my VCR ! ! I did have to run it through about three times before it was clean and functional , but worth the time and effort . Liquid drops do come with it .	1
I used this Wet Head Cleaner and my VCR is working much better.I recommned this product to those who still use a VCR .	1
did the job , worked as instructions said and removed the dirt that it needed to . My player was worn out , so it did not help that problem in the tape jumping	1
this cleaner works very well it is just as advertised and I would recommend this to anyone who needs a cleaner .	1
cleaned my old vcr heads pretty good . quality of the tape playing after cleaning increased slightly enough to backup a good vcr tape to dvd	1
I 've had this radio for months now and really like it . I like the digital tuning and timer function . The battery life is great . I am thinking of buying another one .	1
I purchased this radio from Amazon in May of 2003 . It 's now January 2005 and the radio is still on the first set of batteries . I use it at least a 1/2 hour a day and on weekends as much as 3-4 hours per day . Fantastic . It shows no sign of wear even though it has spent hundreds of hours in the shower , and has even been in light rain beside our spa.It gets great reception ( no TV signals in our town ) , is easy to use , and sounds great.I highly recommend this radio.UPDATE Oct 28 , 2010After 7 1/2 years of daily use my Sony shower radio finally quit . As many others have reported the plastic on the top cracked , water got into the Off button area and the radio would no longer work . However I just ordered another one.This radio has some very good qualities.Pros:1 ) Clear and loud sound2 ) Battery life is so long it is ridiculous . I do n't think I used more than three sets of batteries in 7 years , and I use the radio every day.3 ) Good reception.4 ) Ease of use . I really appreciate an AM/FM radio with station presets.5 ) It is waterproof enough that I take it in the shower every day . I do n't leave it there though because I use it on the bathroom counter while I shave too . Perhaps mine lasted longer than many others because it is n't in the damp shower area 24/7.6 ) I like the top buttons . They are easy to hit with one hand . If the buttons were on the side or front it might require two hands . My radio is never mounted high so I do n't have the issue others complain about where they ca n't see the buttons . Even if I did have it high it is easy to feel where the buttons are as they all have a raised bump.Cons:1 ) $ 49 is a very high price to pay for an AM/FM radio.2 ) It does seem Sony could do some research and improve the plastic top so it would last longer.I was pleased to see this radio is still available for sale . I looked at a few others but nothing matched , in my opinion , this one .	1
Great reception , easy to use and good sound for a one speaker radio .	1
Notice this unit was introduced two and a half years ago and still going strong which indicates to me people really like it and it holds up well . I 've had mine about six months . It 's got everything a radio should have and nothing it does n't need , except maybe the digital clock . The knob on the right top is volume . The rest of the controls are push buttons on the top that include five presets for each of three bands . The buttons are under a protective rubber cover so no need to worry about humidity or splashes . It has an 18 '' antenna with a little suction cup at the end so you can hook it on a mirror . And it has a loop of twine on the back for carrying it around or for hanging it on a coat hook or something similar.I find its clunkiness sort of endearing . The sound quality is all you could ask for , and the reception is excellent . So for what it is , it 's probably as good as it gets .	1
Very easy to use basic functions . Good tone , sufficient volume . Do n't know what I would change , if I could . Well done .	1
I have to say , this radio works flawless in my shower . I 've had it for a little over 3 months and I listen to it daily for about 15 minutes at a time and I still have yet to change the batteries on it ( 2 AA I believe ) . Prior to this shower radio I had a Brookstone am/fm shower radio which took 4 C batteries and I would have to change them about once a month . I get great reception of my FM stations and I even get some TV audio through it , to listen to the Football games . It 's very small and sits nicely on my pedastel and comes with a suction cup antenna . All in all , I strongly recommend this shower radio over any other on the market . No problems , no complaints ... .	1
I 've been using these for over a year now . Basically , in a quiet environment these sound pretty good . They are n't as good as similarly-priced studio-class headsets , but you 're paying for the noise cancelling . The raw capability is pretty decent , and has acceptable detail in treble , vocal , and bass ranges.The noise cancelling works pretty well . I 've taken these on several intercontinental flights and they do a decent job of blocking out engine rumble and screaming kids . They also do a decent job of blocking out adult human voices , which is nice in the office.However , I must have pretty big ears , and I 've found that the foam cups are n't quite thick enough to adequately push the driver away from my outer ear . After 2 or 3 hours of use my ears start to ache a bit.The cord is plenty long , and can be disconnected in the middle to link to an optional Sony wired remote control . An adapter to convert the standard 1/8th inch stereo jack to the dual 1/8th inch jacks in many airplane seats is included.The thing that I do n't like about this is that I find these uncomfortable when I try to lean my head against the window in an airplane and sleep . I think that the MDR-NC11 's might have been a better choice in that regard.They 're also kind of bulky unless you have a large carry-on to keep them in . I 'm paranoid about putting these in the seat pocket in front of me , since the MDR-NC20 's come with a soft bag instead of a rigid clamshell like the Bose headsets . I have n't had any spills yet , but active travellers may wish to find a case that 's more rigid.All in all , I 'm pretty happy with these . The natural audio sound and the noise cancelling are plenty sufficient for the price ... I could n't justify the $ 300 for Bose unless I needed the protective clamshell and had ears that fit perfectly into their earcups .	1
Pretty easy to use and down load programs for someone that can spell kompooter 2 out of 3 times .	1
This is my first DVD after thinking about it for two months . I 've only purchased it since DVD 's are entering the Rental market . With 500 lines of resolution ( Using the S-video connector cable ) , this system has the same picture quality of any current DVD player ( dont be fooled ! ) , The sound can still be decoded for dolby surround . Great Buy !	1
If you like to listen to AM talk radion , sports or news this radio is unbeatable . I have the Sony ICF SW7600GR and the AM section ca n't hold a candle to the Superadio III.Personally I think the tuning and volume pods are smooth and fairly precise compared to what others have found . I am amased that this unit gets the job done for $ 40.00.It does what it says . Hope this is helpful .	1
I have several Superadio 's , both II 's and III 's . I 'm not particularly wild about their redesign of the III 's case ( the II had a tremendous generic radio look to it ) , but the reception and audio quality is about the same . As other reviewers have noted , the dial accuracy is poor , so you have to & quot ; learn & quot ; each Superadio 's setting , but once you learn where stations are , they stay put.This is a superb radio , with surprisingly good sound and excellent reception . I have one at work , one in the kitchen , and one that I tote around ( to the beach , to the driveway for carwashing , to the b-ball court ) . Versatile , solidly built and nice priced .	1
I bought this radio as a garage/workshop unit for use when tinkering around . I wanted something that had no gimmicks , that plugged into the wall , was analog tuned , so there was no power draw or batteries to worry about when it is off , and so that I know it will last me a LONG time without an LCD failure or whatnot.This radio definitely delivers . Sound quality is awesome , reception is top notch , and it does exactly what I desired it to . Not small , trendy or stylish - if youre looking for that , go elsewhere . But for a rugged , quality unit , with good sound from one speaker , you cant do much better .	1
and I bought one for my dad also . The thing I like about it is it pulls in the AM stations very well . I listen to a lot of talk radio in the office and the other *cheap* boom box type radios can not cut through the computer generated RF but this one discriminates and I can hear the stations . Also , the large speaker works wonderfully for rich sound better than most stereo boxes . It is also very inexpensive . I would recommend to anyone .	1
Good sound , good options . A bit larger than you might think from the picture . Sound is good , as is reception . I have it on the back corner of the desk as background music .	1
I have spent the last 2 weeks trying to get decent FM radio reception in the middle of an office building with significant EMI ( Electromagnetic Interference ) . I tried three radios , including the Radio Shack ( RS ) Portable AM/FM Radio with Extended AM Range , Cat # 12-903 , which is modeled after the GE Superadio . ( The Superadio and the RS 12-603/12-903 are often compared out on various pages on the internet and have the exact same features . ) My goal was to receive my favorite FM station , which is a weaker station sandwiched between two strong stations . The Superadio , with the help of a C. Crane FM Reflect antenna found at ..was the only radio/antenna combo that would bring it in for me . ( I also tried 3 other antennas , including 2 amplified antennas ) Another nice item is that I get excellent FM reception on almost every channel now . The ability to turn off the Auto Frequency Control seems to make all the difference for my needs . The RS 12-903 had the same switch , but I did n't notice a significant difference when I turned it on or off , like I do with the Superadio . The only thing the RS 12-903 had going for it was it 's sturdier case , but it was more , even on sale . I have n't done much with AM , so I ca n't comment on that . I hope this is helpful .	1
Being a former ham radio operator in the 60 's , I appreciate the features GE put back in their `` SUPERRADIO '' that used to be standard . The best is the tuned RF stage that pulls in distance stations with ease . Second is the dual power feature : a line cord comes built in , and in battery mode , it takes 6 `` D '' cells so they last a very long time . Third , Two loudspeakers give amazing soundquality and volume . It 's hard to believe you can buy this for under $ 50.00 ! This is a great radio and I will be buying more forChristmas presents .	1
This is just a fantastic product.I 've owned two for fifteen years and hope they never stop making this model in case I want another.The sound is great , the reception is great , the price ( was ) great ; the durability is great and the battery usage is great . It 's all great.It is certainly not `` feature rich '' but who needs all that nonsense for AM and FM radio ? More feature would just get in my way.TIP : The radio has a ground screw on the back which I 'm guessing most people do n't use . After hooking up a long wire outdoor antenna , I noticed that what really helped AM DX reception was the ground ! I bought a grounding rod from Radio Shack to isolate the radio from the noisy house wiring system . ( I pounded in the rod in the ground outside the house . ) That REALLY helped ! So much so , that I removed the wire antenna and now only use the ground .	1
I 've owned several of these items and all were inferior and really useless . This unit fits well and the sound quality I hear is superb . I 've asked those I 've talked with how they hear me and they say it is also loud and clear . Guess I 'd have to give it a total of five stars .	1
Headset is comfortable and works well . I can still get things done around the house while talking on the phone and this is a great help . Only drawback is that microphone is mounted on plastic mouth piece and this limits adjustability for the distance from mouth to microphone .	1
This worked well to transfer a caller ID signal to an area where I have a cable box and TV . This was very good for my needs , but I did listen to the line and it was noisy when using some outlets . I also had a tough time finding two different outlets that would `` talk '' to each other and transfer the caller ID signal ; but after a lot of trial and error it seems to work flawlessly .	1
I bought two and use them in different parts of the house to listen to my Sirius Satelite radio . I can walk around the house and listen to either Howard or the Rolling Stones channel through out , using one boom box.There are a few things to keep in mind if you want to get full use of these . * A ) * Set the volume going into the transmiter higher . 2 ) Low volume in will cause popping and fading . Very low volume in will for some reason cause the transmitter to shut down . 2 ) Higher volume in will allow you to lower the preamp volume on the speakers and play with less distortion and lower noise level . When you increase the volume on the speakers , you are amplifying the NOISE as well as the music . Makes sense , right ? B ) The power cord is also part of the antenna , so its location and position can be adjusted to improve reception . I used little plastic wire ties to afix the cord to speaker stands . The cord runs straight down like a verticle antenna.C ) The speaker is still a radio reciever and subject to interferrence . You can adjust the frequency on the transmitter and on the recievers ( speakers ) . Fine tune them for the best reception in your location . This may take a few adjustsments . Remember , cellphones , WIFI etc can all interfere ! I tried plugging the transmitter into my stereo 's headset jack , but it did n't work well , because the output was too low . I 'm going to cut the plugs off of the Y adapter or make an adapter with bare wires and try using them as the rear ( effects ) channel of my home theater.I love these speakers and use them everyday . They could be a little better , but I still love them ! I 'd give them 5 stars if they were a little louder , a little better tone wise and the reception range was a little better . You 'd get 150 ' in an open feild or gymnasium , not my odd shaped house . But for the money , they are a great VALUE ! My house is made concrete & steel and has metalic tinted glass all over , so wireless stuff does n't work the greatest . With my windows closed & the tranmitter on my patio , I get about 30 ' with occaisional drift . Your house might be better . I 'm going to buy another pair because I see that they are discontinued and these sound better than the newer ones . I 'm also concerned that the new ones may have differnt frequencies , which is a good thing if you want to use more than one pair at a time , connected to different inputs.Better hurry up and buy now , before I get buy all !	1
Having spent 2 hours with the Magellan 315 on a camping weekend in Arizona 's mountains , I can say that the unit is all that 's advertised . The manual is cryptic , but once you get used to the customizing menus and 9 available navigation screens , the rest is pretty intuitive . I was able to create a waypoint , walk half a mile away in the woods and return to within 20 feet . It works surprisingly well even in a rather heavy forest . It was showing an estimated RMS positional error of only 6 feet at one point ! Routes are given in 1. foot increments when you are within .1 miles of your waypoint ( with the updated software you can download from the Magellan website ) ! As long as you keep moving , the compass feature is quite good . It even displays the sun and moon locations versus the compass dial.Nice screen , plenty of options and quite accurate . When used in your car , it tracks your speed to .1 mph , with updates given each second . If you are a hiker or hunter or fisherman or gizmo lover , this is a nice addition . I suspect on an open lake , this would be super for locating favorite fishing spots .	1
Screen small ... hard to read while driving.Battery eater . I use the DC adapter , however.No maps.Not enough contrast on screen . With sunglasses while driving , ca n't see screen.Tiny print on & quot ; Goto & quot ; destination . Impossible to read while driving.Good , quick operation once you learn it..Does everything it says it will.I like it except for the above things ... .	1
I bought 4 prs of these about 6 years ago for an extended trip . 6 plane rides later , we were all happy with the purchase . I do n't think the stewardesses were happy that we did n't have to buy headphones though ... but , they worked well and we were able to hear the in-flight movie and the movies on our portable DVD players . 4 stars because they are a little flimsy and some of them broke with more rugged use when we got home . However , two pair are still functioning quite well . Saw these at this reduced price and I just bought 5 more pair for some travelling this Summer . I do n't get into all the techie stuff that others do ... I just say if it works well , great ...	1
I got these headphones long time ago and still enjoy them ! They are so good - you just listen to your music and nothing else outside . They have few jacks to fit to different systems , so it can be universal to many audio electronics . Also it stratches somewhat , so it can fit to different sizes of head .	1
I have used Maxell Cassettes for over 30 years and never have been disappointed . If you ar an audio purist , do n't purchase this , go for the higher bias . For normal folk like me with tin-pan ears , this product carries audio to near perfection and at a real bargain price , whether that price is retail or sale .	1
If you have an old VCR that still works and you enjoy taping your TV shows you now know how hard it is to find tapes . This will more than likely become even harder . We located these on Amazon . They are a great buy and are becoming very difficult to find . These Maxwell takes are of very good quality and the prices if fantastic .	1
Great price and delivery . We can not often stay up later to watch a favorite show , so we tape it and are able to watch it later . Maxell makes a good product that lasts .	1
I still use videotapes for easy , uncomplicated recording of things I do n't plan on keeping indefinitely . I 've used two tapes from the pack I bought and they are just fine . No problems so far . Am rating 4 rather than 5 only because I have n't been using them long , and I have n't done much re-recording , which is something else I do . I may buy more before it becomes impossible to buy them !	1
The price was right and the quality is what you 'd expect on a vhs . I am using these to record mini-dv films and would recommend	1
Had them shipped directly to my brother on the other side of the state . He is a little & # 34 ; old fashion & # 34 ; and still records on tape.He tells me that the quality of his recorded material plays back great , especially the football games .	1
My Maxell 213030 VHS T160 Standard Grade - 3 Pack arrived on time and in good condition . It is very hard to find VHS in retail stores , but I am glad these tapes can be found here at Amazon and other websites as well . These can record up to 8 hours . I have a VHS tape eraser , which is a giant magnet , so when after viewing my recorded program I erase them to record another program . Very durable . Can be reused over and over again , best when you erase with the tape eraser , otherwise you will see your old program under your new program . I recommend this product . I rate this a 5 star .	1
I thought my expensive old Sony CD player was finished - it skipped and sound was not as good . Allsop restored the player to original good quality . I highly recommend this product .	1
This product really does make a difference . I had an older CD player that was doing a lot of skipping , and sometimes it would not function at all . I ran the cleaning disc through it once , and now it 's working just fine . Great item to have around even if you only need to use it once a year ... certainly beats having to buy a new CD or DVD player !	1
Ca n't say enough good things about this . It took less than a minute to clean my very dirty car CD player . I was shocked that it worked so fast ! Just listen to the voice and switch to track 3 , then after the music on the cleaning disk stops , remove the disk and your done . Unless they came out with a better product , I do n't know why they stopped selling this one !	1
I was looking for an economical cleaning solution for my DVDs so took a chance on these and ordered them from Amazon . I do n't know what they 're made of but they work great . They clean blu-ray as well as regular DVDs without a bit of scuffing or scatching . I followed the instructions and wiped the discs from the centre toward the outside edge . For fingerprints , I found it also helps to breathe on the disc before wiping . The nice thing about these is that they 're re-usable until they get dirty .	1
Pretty simple product . There are about 30 or so sheets in a package . Take one out and wipe in a circular motion . Gets rid of the smudges and makes the disc shine . However , if your kids touch it with grimy fingers it will struggle to remove those types of stains .	1
Very handy . And reusable . well , ... ..now I have to provide more words ... . Handy , handy , handy ! I just need to remember to use , especially on RENTAL DVDs .	1
I have looking around for this item for some time . I had some trouble fined them . It work really good .	1
I have usually used wet cleaners for my discs but have run into quality control problems with the units . I decided to try these , not expecting much . Surprise , they work great ! I had purchased some discs with excessive fingerprints and the like , these cleaned the discs right up . As noted in the item description some small scratches or scuffing can be caused by the wipes , not a major problem if care is taken . I will definitely buy again when my supply is gone !	1
Belkin has never let me down . I had order 2 of these packages and used them all - and am ordering more . I 'm also ordering a longer length version .	1
I love the fact that they work well , do n't separate and can hold alot of cords at the same tome . My husband hates seeing cables all mess - I always have a spare set for him . All the cables are color coordinated at are place and these are the reason why	1
Needed some wire wraps ( instead of wire ties ) to keep my bass guitar amp power cord and equipment cord ( s ) in place while not in use . I tried some other brands and was more of a & # 34 ; pain & # 34 ; than help . Seen this at Amazon and it could n't work better . Easy to put on and easy to remove and keeps the cables nicely tied when needed . Get price too even if it is an & # 34 ; Add-On Item & # 34 ; . Thanks : )	1
These ties are perfect for managing cords . I like that they are reusable and can color-code your electronics . I use the colors based on sound cords . For example : black/silver for HDMI and red/green/blue for composite.I would recommend getting two packages though , you 'll probably need more than you think .	1
Umm ... seriously ? $ 1.63 for these ? These cable ties are really good quality , have a nice long strap with a tight velcro to secure them all . Different colors makes it easier ( kind of ) to keep things organized , but at the very least it adds a bit of color to the jungle of cables you have .	1
green ones for hard drive , red ones for DVD-drive , ... blue cable tie to help with fans and wires.Worth every cent . Every pc enthusiast should have some sort of advanced cable-tie system in place .	1
These are so much better than using zip-ties ! n They 're easy to see , and - more important - much easier to remove ! How many times have you needed to remove a zip-tie and you had to find something sharp , then hope you did n't cut through whatever you had bundled together ? ! These are great for the job !	1
Got these to help tame the mess behind my entertainment center . In essence , they work . They are simply velcro ties you can wrap around several cords , holding them in one , neat bundle . They are n't really meant for identifying cables , but for holding several in a bundle . Because they work great , I ca n't give them less than 4 stars . $ 3 and change is pretty cheap , but if you wanted , you could do the same job with much cheaper products , which is why I did n't give it 5 stars.Summary : Works great . Cheap , but cheaper options available .	1
Bought it on sale . Cheapest I found , no problems .	1
Please price this Belkin USB Pro Series 2.0 cable at your local office supply store . I did . It is over $ 20.00 . Another amazing Amazon deal . We have three in use . Stocking up on a couple of extra at $ 4.95 each with free shipping is a good idea . Quality printer cables will only increase in the future . And the hits just keep on coming .	1
These are excellent quality USB cables that will allow you to connect any USB device ( printer etc . ) to your PC or other USB device .	1
There 's no reason at all to buy misc . electronic USB cables anywhere except through Amazon ! Prices at the 'shacks ' ... 'marts ' ... ..and the less'es - usually will cost you more than double for the same electronic items found on Amazon . So let your motto always be `` Caveat emptor '' i.e. , buyer beware ! !	1
Extremely low price at a high quality made . The cost of it is only a small fraction of any cables price at stores .	1
When I bought a new printer for the computer I use , I needed a USB cable to connect the printer to the hard drive . I ended up purchasing this USB cable from Belkin . It works great and I 've never had any problems with it . Even though the cable is a 2.0 device , it is apparently backwards compatible and will work with most 1.0 devices , too .	1
A good quality cable at a reasonable price . Works as advertised .	1
Good cable , no drawbacks , works fine , clamps on firmly , not much to add here	1
The cord worked great . I needed a longer cable for my Logitec mouse . The cord fit on there prefectly .	1
I had a 1996 PC that I needed to run . It booted up and ran the display . Unfortunately I did not have a 1996 keyboard . This adapter filled my need .	1
The package arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape . The adapter is exactly what I wanted and makes the connection I needed .	1
If you want to use your newly purchased 1984 IBM Model M keyboard with a modern computer using a PS/2 interface . : P	1
My favorite uncle , now in his 90s , hangs on to an old 386 PC running DOS even after I bought him a new PC . He uses both . But he has also hung on to old keyboards he loves , including a pair of keyboards so old that they have the old PC/AT style keyboard connector . He wanted to use one of them with his new PC that has USB inputs only ( I had previously bought him a PS/2 keyboard to USB adapter so he could use his *other* beloved , only slightly newer , keyboard . ) He called me asking if I could find a way to get his old `` big round plug '' keyboard with the new PC.This Belkin F2N017 adapter was just what he needed ( combined with the aforementioned PS/2-USB adapter ) . I had it sent to him and he called me a few days later , with delight , saying that the adapter worked perfectly , adding that he was astonished anyone still made components for devices as old as he was using .	1
I needed another power cord because I forgot to bring it with me on a trip , so I ordered one from Amazon and got it in two days ( Amazon Prime ) .This Belkin cord has a higher quality than the one that originally came with my PC , and the price is very reasonable.I recommend it highly .	1
> Seriously , this is a GREAT product to have around when something `` gives out '' or stops working ! Or to leave plugged in at difficult to reach receptacles where you might use some type of pluggable device ( burner , printer , or even a small desk top CPU or a monitor that you occasionally move around ! ) . Belkin quality here , even at this price ! My power cord came from `` TechUsed '' Company ( though that name is a misnomer because the cord was BRAND NEW , in original packaging ! ) -- shipping included . It arrived quickly , ahead of schedule , nicely wrapped , [ Other companies compete on this item , literally different by a penny -- I thought that `` TechUsed '' did well for me , and some other companies might not do as well with this or other items ... just saying ; from experience ... . ] > This cord did NOT warm up or soften at the ends when used with even `` old '' ( CRT ) monitors and computers ( addressing concerns seen concerning other similar power cords ) . [ If you need a LONGER , 12-foot cord , then look at the 12-foot Belkin cord ( `` Belkin 12-Feet AC Male to Female Replacement Power Cord '' , by Belkin , sold by AMAZON ) -- that longer one being available here at Amazon for a little more than twice this one 's price . ] Since you never know when you might need that extra length -- buy both ... .	1
Does what it says , says what it does . You 'd have to work to screw up a power cord IMO though ...	1
Good snug fit on both ends . No overheating of cord with my computer hard drive and screen ... works perfectly . Good sized cord , which is average for 6 foot cord length . ( Had lost my 2 previous cords ) . Belkin makes a good product .	1
This is the power cable I needed to use with my Desktop PC and it worked wonderfully . The fit on both ends was snug and secure . I did n't experience any loose connections that others have mentioned at all . It plugged into my power supply with just the right amount of force and it will never detach itself unintentionally . PC powered up immediately on first try - which really does n't need to be said ... The bonus - it 's really cheap !	1
Belkin is a good brand , so I did not hesitate in purchasing this power cord . Anyway , there is not much science in a power cord . This one fit perfectly .	1
Product came in Belkin packaging and was the same quality as power cords that come with computers and printers . Worked perfectly with my LCD TV .	1
It works , it 's long , it 's tough , it 's high quality material , my chiwawa is not going to be chewing through this . If your looking for a power cord that just does its job , then get this one . You ca n't find a better AC Adapter Power Cord .	1
Exactly what I needed to get my LCD monitor working again . For buyers , this is interchangeable with many desktop computers and other monitors , so buy it with confidence .	1
This cord is amazing . It feels great and fits into most monitors . It is also made by Belkin which means a lifetime warranty and quality product . And its cheap !	1
Great value if you just need a regular 50 ft. ethernet cable , and you do n't care about the color , etc .	1
What can I say ? ? It was a great price on a 50 ft network cable and it works great ! ! Will buy again if needed .	1
Secure snug fit great colors price is definetly right ! Get what you order at your door with minimal time usually 2 days	1
It 's not the prettiest cable in the world , but it 's well-made and it does what it 's supposed to do . I ca n't really ask for more .	1
The is an extremely cheap and one of the fastest commercial cables you can get . Totally worth the money . Look no where else .	1
The quality of this cable from Belkin seems to be good . They fit my router and are easy to install and remove . I have had trouble with some Ethernet cables in the past so I bought 3 different sizes of Belkin and they all worked great.I even tested the cable and it was fine . I 'll definitely buy these again in the future .	1
Good cable . It is nothing special , but does everything I need it to .	1
I got 5 of these cables in pink , since amazon was offering them as an add on item for a discounted price . I chose pink because it was less expensive than any other color by at least a dollar . So far they have been working perfectly , as most cables do .	1
It works and it 's 7 foot long . What more do you want from a 7 foot Ethernet cable . Wifi is great , but there is no substitute for hard-wiring in when I am playing StarCraft II .	1
Not much to say about ethernet cables . I wanted a mix of different sizes as I rearranged my office , and it was easy to find on Amazon.com .	1
It does what it 's supposed to do ... and well	1
I bought two of these to connect my TV and my surround receiver through an ethernet switch to my router . Plugged them in , everything worked ( Netflix , internet radio ) and never looked at them again . For that price you ca n't make them on your own .	1
it works great..	1
Works great ... it is just ethernet cable . nothing special but perfectly fine as long as reasonably priced . Seems to be well built and solid .	1
It does what it 's supposed to do and it does it well . Fits perfectly and the casing is high quality .	1
The cable did it 's job . It arrived on time and was as expected . I needed a CAT 5 cable to hook another PC to my network	1
It is nice having a 7 foot cable as opposed to the usual 6 foot . It worked out perfect with how I routed the cable to the PS3 . Looking forward to more great shopping on Amazon .	1
I love purple and this is really purple.The cord is good quality and I am happy , have gotten a few more since .	1
This is a quality product at a great price . Works like a charm . Should last for a very long time	1
always go cheap for digital cables . i found this same cable at Wal-mart for ten times the price . no difference what so ever .	1
This is just an extension cable to be used for a keyboard . Most keyboards today have very short cables and this fixed the problem . You may want to tape the two cables together with electrical tape to prevent them from pulling apart but mine had not pulled out so far .	1
It 's Belkin . What more to say ? Nice tight connections and it works . Probably will have only wireless mice soon , but this was handy when I needed it and it did n't give me any problems .	1
This is a great power strip . I use it in my office and there is enough room between each plug that it does n't matter how big the plug next to it is , it does not interfere.I also really enjoy the design and colors . Having a quality item that also looks great it just an extra plus in my book !	1
I have a 486 that I use this drive on . I am so surprised at the speed that it reads the info through the parallel port . I had heard that the parallel port could be slow with a ZIP drive , but it seems to work about the same speed as an ATAPI drive I had preinstalled on my PII 400Mhz . The price is right for ZIP drives . Do n't bother with the 250 MB drive - disks are more and not enough people have the drives yet that support them .	1
The Zip100 is a minimum necessity for today 's larger and larger file formats - MPEG , MP3 , and multiple images files can easily run up to 100MB . I 've used the Zip since its inception when it knocked old Syquest 88MB drives out of business about 5 years ago . The size and convenience is why there is really only one choice for removable media with easy and immediate read-write capability.There are definite pluses and minuses . Some will say get a CD-R ( W ) drive - but burning a CD is definitely not as immediate as a Zip . The parallel port is a major bummer because of the thru-speed . But those of you who are not major speed demons wo n't be disappointed compared to a floppy . The Zip drive allows daisy chaining so you can connect/output to other peripherals.Iomega cut cost on the power on/off ( it 's always on when plugged in ) . But really the overall design is very good - you can place it flat or vertical . Even though the thick parallel cord may tend to twist the main unit.There are a plethora of other Iomega choices . And I would really ask yourself if you are planning on USB or SCSI - each are noticeably faster . On the plus side , the 100MB format is so common in print shops , university labs , and copy places that you ca n't go wrong . Plus the price of each disk is recognizably less than the 250MB . Seriously think about your file formats . If you plan to do a lot video - you 'll need to go with a Jaz . And you can get these refurbished for about the same cost and hold 1Gig . The only barrier to entry is the SCSI necessity and the extra cost of disks . Overall , the Zip100 has been a major workhorse for me - back and forth between work and home/Mac and PC MS98/NT . It has performed flawlessly .	1
This slim case will give your palm quite an elegant touch . It is also lightweight and compact , and it will store your Palm , as well as some business cards and/or credit cards . I personally preffer the hard cover , which has a more modern look and protects the Palm better . Nonetheless , I use the slim leather case when I go to elegant social events because it is slimmer and less heavy , so it is easier to carry in your coat pocket .	1
As a heavy user of my Palm ( which I access dozens of times a day ) , the Palm Slim Leather Case is perfect for my needs . I prefer it over other cases for the following reasons : The first is portablity . I take my Palm everywhere with me ( even to the little boy 's room ) . And with the case 's slim size , my Palm fits easily into my front pants pocket . ( Carrying my Palm in my shirt pocket is also an option . But since my company switched to business casual attire , I no longer wear dress shirts with pockets to work . Hooray ! ) The second reason is convenience . With the Palm rail system , the unit is held securely . And when I need to sync , the case slides off cleanly ( the rail system being a simpler and much more elegant solution than the pocket or Velcro holding methods of other products ) .The third reason is protection . The rigid cover is slightly padded , and the loop closure is very secure . ( Before adopting this case , I once used another cover -- without a loop closure -- which failed to protect my Palm when I accidentally dropped it in the street while I waited on the curb for a cab . ) The loop closure is also easy to open , so access to my Palm is not restricted.My last reason for selecting this case is its ability to hold business cards . I put my business cards ( a whole slew of them ) in the large inside pocket , and I put my kids ' doctor and dentist appointment reminders in the multiple credit card slots , none of which I want to carry in my wallet ( which is already filled with plenty of other stuff ) . Since my Palm is always with me , I 'm never without a business card , so I never miss an opportunity to have my name remembered by the many new customers or vendors I meet . ( As a comparison , many of the hard cases are very stylish . But since they ca n't carry business cards , they are n't really adequate for my needs . ) For a great combination of style and function that 's perfect for a heavy Palm user like me -- the Palm Slim Leather Case is ideal !	1
I got this case because I had two needs . I wanted to protect my Palm V from the frequent falls out of my front coat pocket ; but I did n't want to significantly increase its size and weight.This case fits both bills nicely . The added bulk and texture of the leather holds the Palm in your pocket for that split second necessary to grab it before it falls ; and when it does fall , even if it lands on a corner , the screen does n't crack . Just what this doctor ordered.I use the pockets to store a couple of cards , nothing more . Works like a charm . The clasp is sort of odd , just a tab of leather slipping into a buckle . A snap or velcro would have been nicer , but so far it does hold closed on its own.The leather smells nice and has been wearing well . The little Palm logo embossed on the front is sort of cute , too . Overall I 'm happy with this case and the price is certainly right .	1
My zip drive finally went out . It worked for at least ten years . Current USB drives have more capacity and are a lot cheaper . One can buy a 128MB USB drive for $ 2.99 dlls ! !	1
I purchased a zip to keep from loosing files ... if system crashed ... not realizing the zip would stop working first . Found a refurbished more updated with usb and I am in heaven . Now I can travel with it ... .	1
CF readers with USB cords ? Why bother ? Say goodbye to those bothersome cords ! This CF adapter is the answer to keeping your portable computer PORTABLE . One little adapter allows you to plug in your Compact Flash cards for quick and easy reading . I bought this item when I purchased my latest digital camera and it has been a blessing ! It 's so simple to use , light-weight , compact -- and incredibly inexpensive ! How simple ? Plug your CF card in one end , plug the adapter with card into the appropriate slot in your laptop and the computer is ready to read and write to the CF card just like it was another drive . How sweet is that ?	1
Adapter works fine -- laptop is 5 years old , but everything worked fine . Good price at Amazon .	1
Great lock for the price . If you need a low cost lock to defend against amateur thieves than this is the lock for you .	1
I needed three of these for field employees.Easy to set-up a memorable code and attach to the laptop.I would recommend !	1
I now have three of these and have to HIGHLY recommend this item . I use it for my computer as well as for my tv center .	1
APC ( which by the way is American Power Conversion , not `` American Power Conservation '' as amazon.com currently shows it ) has always been serious about clean power . This is no ordinary surge protector . It has more heavy-duty protection features and absorbs more joules of surge energy than you 're ever likely to see . But what I like is the intelligent layout of the outlets ... with my ADSL modem , I now have three huge `` wall warts '' to deal with . The PRO8T2 handles them well , and manages another smaller one in the top tier of outlets . A large green light lets me know it 's working . And the switch guard is removable -- if you WANT to be able to turn this unit on and off with your toe , APC made that possible , and they call out the feature in the instructions . You can spend $ 20 for a much less capable power station , or a few bucks more for one that will take care of your stuff . APC delivers the latter with this unit .	1
I was skeptical of the palm hardcase at first . Afterall , it is just a piece of plastic with some aluminum sheeting on it . I no longer have doubts.I have unintentionally dropped my Palm from considerable heights on a variety of surfaces ( brick , hard wood floor , etc . ) , and both the case and , more importantly , the Palm itself have come out completely unscathed.So , my advice is , if you are looking for real protection for your investment , just get one of these . There is no need to spend more on a titanium box from rhino skin or any of the others ( unless you are planning on using the Palm for mountain climbing or on the shooting range ... ) .Not surprisingly , the engineers over at Palm really did a fantastic job making this case stylish , too . You do n't feel geeky pulling it out , and the brushed aluminum goes very well with the Palm itself.An excellent product .	1
This is a great item . I tried three different 'soft ' cases and always had a problem with the Palm coming on and beeping while it was in my pocket . Give this baby FIVE STARS ! The critism is WRONG . A . Ca n't use left handed ? Sure you can . Just put it in the left side ! B . Ca n't synch while in the case ? You bet you can . Just tilt the stand to the side . No problem .	1
This one is a good extra investment if you 're buying a Palm V. The little leather flap that comes with the Palm is really not adequate to protect your machine . This hard case is tough enough to withstand serious blows . It looks elegant and it 's not too big - the Palm will still fit in your shirt pocket when in the case . I recommend getting this one - you need to get something to protect from scratching anyway , and this case protects from much much more .	1
these batteries are exactly what i expected ( @ 1.3 Volts ) and work well for any electronic device i put these in i plan on buying even more in the future this is a Great buy	1
really good deal for only 7 dollars . they came very quick and work like there supposed to . i got what i pad for and have no regrets .	1
If you have a lot of DVDs or CDs these wallets are the way to go . I have over 800 CDs and they were eating up my space . After getting rid of all the jewel cases I can store all of my CDs and DVDs on one book shelf . And since I organized them by theme , it is easy to find what I am looking for . By the way : you can mark the outside of the wallets with a white-out pen . It makes it easy to know what 's inside each wallet . For the DVD wallet you will need to do a little trimming for some of the Liner notes . But it is easy to do . Trust me ... once you start using these wallets , you 'll love 'em . For what you get with these wallets I find the price fair . Even better here on Amazon.com Enjoy	1
Definitely worthwhile for equipment one wants to keep . I teach at an urban high school . It is amazing what some students will take . Ever since a student took my projector when I had a sub so I could attend a meeting , I lock as much down as possible . Interesting that the school district does not bother with locks .	1
This product came as described and worked perfectly . I consider all factors when ordering , including quality , price and company reputation . This product passed all . I can recommend this to others.While it is not by any means foolproof I do feel better . The install was a breeze .	1
Anything can be defeated but this definitely improves security , well designed and thought out . Delivered on schedule , with usual good service .	1
Great for securing computer equipment . Currently I purchased this to use in a hospital and was exactly what I was looking for .	1
This multi-outlet has a long cord ( 16 ' ) so we were able to make a charging area for 6 devices ( and their respective adapters of all shapes and sizes ) quite far from the outlet . The product also looks nice enough to have out in plain sight .	1
This is the only one of my many surge protectors that has a 16 foot cord and I find that to be so useful . I have had it for over a year and it is my favorite not only because of the cord length but also the compact size which is nicely balanced and able to easily accommodate six uniquely sized charger plugs . I like this Kensington model so much that I have just purchased another as a gift .	1
This is a nice looking and space saving 6 socket outlet . I replaced an old PowerSquid with this unit and it has worked as expected . I really like the color coded sockets and the circular design , which resulted in a smaller footprint .	1
This circular outlet is perfect for the area under our oval conference table at work , where we hold many training sessions . We have used it for many months and not had any issues with it . It 's heavy enough that it stays in place , and light enough that I can lean down , yank it over , plug in something and shove it back under the table without having to crawl underneath . It is very sturdy and seems to have taken all our ( and our trainees ' ) abuse without any problems . Perfect for areas where a long power strip wo n't work or would be less convenient .	1
This does exactly what I needed : it provides a surge strip with plenty of room for transformer wall warts.Some of the pluses:1 ) The cord is nice and long and the plug is flat so it can go behind furniture.2 ) The outlets are color coded and it includes a couple of sets of corresponding color cord stickers you can put on device cords so you know what device you are unplugging when the cords all look alike.3 ) The device itself is actually smaller than it appears in the pictures . For me , that 's good because it takes up less space . The footprint is roughly the size of a salad plate.4 ) Like most other plug strips , there are slots on the back to allow it to be mounted on a wall , the side of a desk or on the bottom of a shelf.I 'm very satisfied with my purchase .	1
The circular design saves desk space and the extra long cord is helpful in setting up in an office cubicle . There is central power button that turns off all the items plugged into the colorful base . The colors are not the same , so different appliances can be assigned a different color . Useful if you have to unplug on device to use in another room or location .	1
I am the very satisfied owner of the Palm V connected organizer . I had long wanted a hand held organizer , one that would have both computer interchangeable abilities and one that would be able to perform different applications . Christmas day was a happy one for me last year , not only because of the brimming smiles on my children 's faces ; but because that is when I received the Palm V as a gift from my Santa ( my wife ! ) .After giving the product and it 's instructions a look over , within moments I was on my way and began the charging procedures necessary prior to it 's use . This was my only initial disappointment , having to wait for the initial charging that takes 4 hrs . I could n't wait to tinker with my new toy , and it was a bit annoying . After completing the charge up , I installed the cd that came with the product to familiarize myself with it . The cd is both quite informative and very easy to follow . Then I was ready to begin to learn about my new toy.Looks can be deceiving when it comes to the appearance of the Palm V. In viewing the device , with it 's ultra sleek , thin design ; one might come to the conclusion it could be nothing more than your basic address/date book . This little & quot ; power packer & quot ; ( as I like to call it ) is simply amazing ! The applications that can be utilized with the Palm V as well as the storage capacities are as follows:1 ) Address book : that holds up to 6000 addresses2 ) Appointment record : that records up to 3000 appointments3 ) E-mail functioning : that can receive up to 200 e-mail messages4 ) Memo pad : that can hold up to 1500 memos5 ) To Do List : that records up to 1500 to-do items6 ) Expense Reports7 ) Games8 ) Security9 ) Calculator ( All storage figures are approximate , and flexible according to the overall storage capacity of 2 MB ) The Palm V also comes complete with the necessary software to facilitate all functions on the organizer . Other items that came with my Palm V were the synchronizing cradle & amp ; battery recharger , the handbook , an adapter , a protective cover , and one metal stylus and a spare plastic one.While the Palm V comes to you with all the pre-programming stated in my epinion , it also has the capability of being able to receive downloads from the internet to expand its functions , or to simply download games to play on this hand held device.The ease of operation of the Palm V is remarkable . On it 's face are are 5 buttons on the metal frame and an area on screen with 4 buttons ( to be used with the stylus ) , as well as an area for information input or free hand graffiti writing . All of these help the user quickly and efficiently operate the Palm V to expedite the tasks at hand . The device also has a back light that can come in rather handy.Input of information into the Palm V can be done in a number of ways . One can access the keyboard on the device , or use special graffiti free hand writing to input the desired material . The device may also be directly hooked up to your PC and the information typed in with your computer 's keyboard.The greatest thing about the Palm V is the ability to transfer data between the device and your computer . The ability to be able to access e-mail , download information from the internet or your computer , for me is a God send ; and in my opinion nothing sort of revolutionary ! To process the transference of information , the Palm V needs to be placed into the HotSync cradle . Then the user just presses the HotSync button on the device to perform the HotSync operation . It proves to be completely user friendly as far as the exchange between the organizer and the computer.Maintaining your organizer requires as little as a few minutes charging a day of the Palm V , by placing it in its cradle . No need to buy batteries , it is self contained with a Lithium ion rechargeable battery . It is so small in size and weighs a mere 4 ounces , it easily is carried in a coat pocket ; both comfortably and unnoticed.My main use for the Palm V is during my business hours . It is always on my person , for me to access at a moment 's notice , to jot down things I need to remember ( which are many with my bad recall ) . Whether it be to record an appointment that I have just confirmed with a client , or a note to myself ; the Palm V has become an invaluable device ; one that has proven to make my day much more pleasant and hassle free . No more need to run to a desk for a paper or pen , or to ask my callers to hold on ; I am always ready with my Palm V on hand.If you do not have any prior experience with a hand held organizer of this kind , and always thought about purchasing one , I would highly recommend the Palm V. Once you have had a device like this , you will never want to be without one . Just like all the modern luxuries in life , what you do n't have you do without and do n't miss ; but what you 've had and have no longer , is greatly missed and still desired for easier living . Thank you Palm V for making my life , just a little bit easier !	1
I had trouble the first week getting the Palm to hotsync to my Thinkpad , and the Palm 5 even crashed once , losing all my data before the hotsync was working.Since then this thing has become an essential part of my life . Works like a charm , both the Palm 5 itself and the hotsync too . Address book , calendar , notes ... The Palm is easily the best designed hardware/software since the Macintosh of the late 1980's.By the way , I am also using the Franklin/Covey software for personal management and find this is a nice increment over the built-in daily task list of the Palm .	1
I ca n't believe this can still be reviewed . I do n't have much to say , but I have a few old contacts still on my ten year old Palm that I still havent transferred over . I know . The point is that my Palm sits in my drawer and always powers on perfectly . I do n't think I have even charged it in a few years . This thing is amazing in its longevity .	1
Product does exactly what I need and the price works very well for me ! Will keep on buying these for as long as I need to ...	1
These labels are perfect for what they are supposed to do and are pre fit exactly to the space provided and are exactly what I was shopping for .	1
I have tried an awful lot of CD inserts and these are by far the most cost effective and functional . I just love them .	1
These worked very well first time and every time so far on my printer . I 'd been printing my inserts on 25-pound paper before so these are a vast improvement ; the perforations make it easy to separate the parts .	1
I have 3 of these nic 's running here at home and I also have a 10/100 4-port hub from Netgear . It was so simple to install . I tried another brand nic first and could not get my computer to boot up on them . I took them back and got Netgear FA-310TX . Plugged them in and it worked the first time . I do n't know about you , but I hate & quot ; hard to install hardware & quot ; A great buy at Amazon ... ! I need one more so I am buying it here . Thank 's Amazon	1
I took this hub out of the box , plugged it in , connected it to our internal network and my two PC 's about two months ago , and it has worked flawlessly ever since . All without reading the manual ! This hub is perfect for me because I occasionally attach a legacy 10Mbps device and do n't need more than three ports ( other than to link to our existing network ) .One warning - if you have other Netgear hubs and equipment , keep the power supplies separate . I had a single-speed 100Mbps hub and got the power supplies mixed up . The unit looked like it was working but actually was n't . The power supplies look similar , the plugs are the same , but I think the current and/or voltages are different.Other than that , this is a great product . As I said earlier , it just works . When you factor in price , you ca n't miss .	1
These days , there is almost never a reason to buy a hub ... For most applications , everyone should be buying a switch.I just bought for of these for our lab , because nothing beats a hub for allowing you to sniff network traffic when debugging network software.For someone wanting a REAL hub , the DS104 is a real hub !	1
I bought this hub to connect the computers in my home so they could share a cable modem . I looked at a lot of 10Base-T hubs , and found this one to be among the least expensive with the best satisfaction ratings . I am especially impressed with the hub 's small size and metal case -- other hubs are larger and have plastic cases.To me , the best recommendation for a piece of network hardware is that you never have to think about it , it just works . This hub gives me that in spades .	1
A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers . Either way , the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised . Netgear is known for making quality Ethernet products and this is just another one of them .	1
This sturdy case has outlasted many cameras and I find it adequate for carrying my camera around .	1
I have the Kodak DC 3400 camera - and this carry case is perfect for it . This case is compact - but yet large enough to take everything along that I need : extra batteries , PC cables , the camera 's manual and CD disk , and a Kodak AA battery charger.It works so well with the DC 3400 , it 's almost as if it was made for it . Good case for the money.To see if this case is right for you , compare your digital camera 's dimensions to Kodak 's DC 3400 . If the cameras are similar in size , you 're all set .	1
This case is the perfect size for the D-460 and accessories ( case is approx 7 & quot ; tall X 3.5 & quot ; wide X 3 & quot ; deep ) . The main pouch is well padded and made of soft material . The bottom is reinforced to resist wear . Inside the front zippered pocket , there is a mesh pocket for memory cards , as well as an divided elastic band meant for 4 AA batteries . Inside the flap of the front pocket there is a zippered mesh pouch , which runs the entire legnth of the flap ( approx . 6 & quot ; x3 & quot ; ) , for extra accessories.The only thing I dislike is the velcro on the main flap is a bit weak , and seems to come open without much force . I would have rather seen a zipper to keep the main pouch closed.Other than that , this is a fantastic case , and I recommend it .	1
I bought this bag to use with my Olympus C-4000 . Based on what other reviewers wrote , I expected the bag the bag to be more compact than it is ( I could fit two of my cameras in there ) . Construction and compartments are excellent , and it 's a great bag if you have a few accessories to carry .	1
This is a basic sound card . Nothing fancy . The thing that seperates it from the rest is that Creative is a huge company and has drivers available for all Windows ( the Linux/BSD world probably supports this thing , I have n't checked ) . This is as close to plug and play as you can get.That guy who ranted about this card crashing his system needs to buy a clue and check his IRQs , not to mention dump Windows ME ( which *Microsoft* does n't even stand by ) .	1
good product for the price i buyed for a gift , the owner says to love it .	1
I purchased this binocs for a tiger safari in India and am amazed by the quality of this product . Certainly recommended and a great value for price . AAAAAAA plus quality .	1
I recently upgraded my stock Hewlett Packard Pavillion 9895 speakers to the Yamaha YSTMS50W 80-Watt 3-Piece Subwoofer/Satellite Computer Speakers . First and foremost , let me tell you one thing : wow , and I really mean WOW , what a great set of computer speakers ! Understand : you do n't get full blown surround sound with these speakers -- few PC applications necessitate this type of audio quality anyway . But unlike the higher end 5.1 and 6.1 speakers on the market today , these speakers will , out of the box , work with and optimize the performance of most stock sound cards . And this is important if you want to get superior performance at a reasonable cost.My only complaint ( and it is an exeedingly *small* one ) is that the audio controls are split between one satellite speaker ( volume and on/off ) and the sub woofer ( base volume ) -- it would be more convenient to have all audio controls on one unit ( i.e . on a satellite speaker ) . But I can more than live with this almost negligible inconvenience to get the type of sound that these speakers deliver for the price.Net/net:1 ) Awesome ( I would even say unsurpassed ) sound quality to cost ratio2 ) Extremely easy set-up ( took me less than 10 minutes -- and this included carrying the box up the stairs to my PC room ) 3 ) Wished the connecting wires were longer ( the ones that came with my unit restrict satellite speaker placement to within 5 feet of the sub-woofer ) 4 ) Needs some industrial design tweaks ( i.e . audio controls should all be in one place ) 5 ) Rich base , sweet high-ends , and earth shaking volume for you hard rockers or gamers6 ) MUST HAVE FOR ANY AUDIOPHILE WHO IS ON A BUDGET	1
These speakers stunned me . When my tiny & quot ; came with the PC & quot ; speakers died , I looked into getting some similar little speakers , but then realized that I could spend just a few dollars more for this three speaker set.First , let me say that the subwoofer BOOOMS ! The bass from the compact cube is deeper and more throbbing than my full stereo system . Really remarkable . I used this system in my dorm room at Columbia University this summer , and all my dorm mates were so amazed that the speakers were frequently borrowed for watching DVDs , and one classmate was so impressed that she bought her own set immediately a day after borrowing mine . With the massive BOOOOM of the system , it was easy to see why everyone was so enthusiastic.My only complaint , in fact , is that BOOM ! The subwoofer does n't have an independent volume control , so if I turn up the volume on the little speakers , the subwoofer follows right along , thunderously loud . A separate volume control on the subwoofer would have made this speaker set perfect .	1
This lightweight headset does the job , and the price is right . It 's held up well for 4 months of daily use . The fact that it lightly hangs on the ear rather than fitting snugly took a couple days to get used to , but it 's nice that it is so light .	1
This excellent headset in an outstanding bargin . Sound quality is excellent with several cell phones I have tried , and it is good with most cordless house phones ( cordless phones sometimes have poor gain on the mic ) .In fact , sound quality is vastly better with other types of earpieces and ear buds . In a normal room , no one will know you are using it . In a car , it is slightly noticable.Some friends complain that the earpiece flops around a bit , but indeed , it never falls off . ( Unless you have really small ears ) .	1
As I write this I am sad to say that my trackball is finally starting to show its age as it is becoming difficult to register clicks after 15 years of solid , daily use.The design put years back on the life of my wrist and saved me from certain carpal tunnel issues.It is not easy for everyone to get used to it as I have laughed at many who have tried to use my pc for something quick , but just like anything else it has a learning curve and I simply can not imagine life without it.I came to Amazon hoping I could somehow score one of these without destroying my bank account and I fell on the floor when I saw what people are charging.The sad part is that I actually considered spending $ 500 on getting one of these for a few moments.If I knew 100 % that any of these ridiculously priced trackball FXs on here were brand new , I would actually buy one.THAT is how good this thing is .	1
I like this headset . I have four of them . I find I use PTT most of the time , to avoid cut off first syllables , etc . When I absolutely have to be hands-free , though , the VOX will work , too . Decent , understandable audio , unlike some I 've used	1
Works well.Only issue I have is it appears to automatically activate VOX mode . And I 'd rather use PTT.Other note might be that compared to the old spirit gt headset , it 's not a comfortable . But it 's good enough .	1
This mic works well , but it 's a bit awkward . I got it because the webcam I was using did n't have a built-in microphone for my Yahoo Messenger and Skype live chats . It was crisp and clear sounding , but I 've since upgraded my webcam and no longer need it so much .	1
I purchased these to use with the Motorola TalkAbout and the cases while biking to work . I sometimes rode a little faster than my biking partner and these helped us to stay in touch . This was a good purchase .	1
If the cord was 1 foot longer , 5 stars . I do n't get it . Is someone saving 2 cents for every one of these ? Or.. make the earpiece cord shorter and the thicker part longer . Would have been great if it came with a removable ear clip/wire but not really complaining about that . Maybe a future feature . Then again , if they ca n't make the cord 1 foot longer , I would n't expect any other luxuries . Functionally seems fine .	1
This push to talk ear bud worked great needed it for work and it never failed me . Would purchase again .	1
i bought this because when i do my volunteer work it is extremely hard to hear . so with this one i could hear everything that goes over the radio . THIS IS A 1 PIN REMOTE SPEAKER . YOUR RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE A SLOT FOR 1 PIN TO USE THIS.pro.-built nicely-able to have the radio on low and still be able to hear everything ( keep in mind of the noise around you ) -push to talk built incon-i use a safety pin so i could attach it my uniform better . may pull the clothes down a bit ( need to break in the wires has to be looser ) this is something smallthis does have a clip on the back of the speakers but i dont like to use it.overallprice cheaper now compared to when it first name came out ( about $ 15 less ) sound goodjust overall its very good.i would recommend this .	1
Nice having a speaker mic . Setting the channel on the radio and putting it in the side pocket of the pack and only having the speaker mic on the shoulder strap . Too bad Motorola can not reduce its weight . When hiking , every ounce counts .	1
I havent had a chance to use the casettes yet but since they are brand new in an unopened factory package I am sure they are just fine . Im just glad they got here quickly ! !	1
this is a small and cute bag , a book size.If you have a long drive trip , you may need a bigger one , except dump it often.if you have kids on the trip , you need a bigger one .	1
The good stuff : -BFO for SSB-will tune in 1 KHz steps-very very good sound through phones ( if you have good ones ) -very good sound with built in speaker-FM stereo through phones-very good FM-good AM/MW-good SW with whip ant.-handy reel ant.-very good owner 's manual with frequency guide for ameteur , aironautical , and maritime.-nice case-built very well with good quality feel to it.Things that bug me , but not too much : -Bass and Treble would be nice , but if not CA N'T WE AT LEAST HAVE A TONE KNOB ? Not even the famed Sony 2010 has one ! Why not ? The hi/low switch is better than nothing , and does an ok job.-No rf gain control.Two way dx/local switch only-no tune knob just up and down buttons , so it 's a bit of a pain to band scan.Push push push push push push push.Can tune in 1 KHz steps.-BFO only . No usb/lsb.Tunes in 1 Khz steps with bfo `` fine tune '' knob.Still ok for ssb , just could be better.-no sync detector.Hay , what do 'ya want for that price ? -Cheezy `` earbud phones '' . Then again , did you ever get a decent pair of headphones with anything ? Not me.Spend a little and get some Koss `` Porta-pro '' phones.You will never go back to cheap ones again ! -dial light only stays on for 10 sec.Do n't let all of this talk you out of one though.What it does it does well ... .All in all : A fine little radio esp . for the $ . Quite good sound with the speaker , and very very good through phones.Good MW/Am dx ( not a 2010 or RF-2200 but , still a lot better than you might think ) .Good with just the whip ant . for SW.Very good FM.I think it 's by far the best radio you can get for the money ... .grab one while you can still get a new one ... .8 )	1
I 've had the opportunity to compare the Grundig YB400PE to several premium radios , the Tivoli PAL , the Sony ICF SW35 , the Grundig S35 , the Sangean 505 , and the Kaito 1102 . How does it rank ? It ties for second with the aforementioned radios for FM . First place goes to the Kaito 1102 . For AM , it takes a tie for last place with the Sangean 505 . Even the reception strength meter shows a weak signal for 790 AM , a major Los Angeles station . In contrast , my Kaito 1102 's meter shows `` full strength '' in its signal . And you can hear a HUGE difference too . The YB 400 does have a good speaker , clear and adequate for a radio its size , but it 's not exceptional . I 'd give the nod to the Kaito 1102 . Since the Kaito 1102 is similarly sized and is fifty dollars cheaper than the YB400 , I say it 's a no brainer : Get the Kaito 1102 .	1
This radio is easy to use , and sounds great . Coverage of the shortwave spectrum is very good . You also get sideband tuning , which you 'll need if you want to hear HAM radio operators . Off the built in telescoping antenna I get more strong stations than I have time to listen to . With the supplied aux . antenna , reception is noticably improved . It comes with ear-bud headphones , AC adapter and the aux antenna . It also has AM and FM reception . FM is stereo with the headphones , and is very good quality . It has 2 built in clocks ( believe me , you WANT that ! ! ) 40 memories , and doubles as a clock radio small enough to use when traveling . This could be considered an entry level radio , but it is sensetive enough that you wo n't `` out grow '' it for a very long time .	1
Perfect for small jobs where you do n't need all that extra cable . I got two just because they were so cheap .	1
As my modem sits right on top of my computer , a three foot cable was the best length for my needs so as to minimize cable clutter behind the computer . Connectors fit fine with reliable connections . Have cycled connectors numerous times in order to break the computer connection on web sites which cause browser to freeze so these can apparently handle cycling without reliability problems . This was important as I 've had the plastic latch fail on other CAT5 cables from plugging / unplugging .	1
I have to give Belkin credit ; the cable really does appear snagless . I used this short cable to connect an Apple TV directly to router . I try to avoid wireless when I can , but this cable had to fight for space among a clutter of cables through a small access panel in the back of the entertainment center . The texture of the cable 's insulation , coupled with the cable 's supple flexibility , made it easy to snake the cord through the tangled mess.The connection is solid and secure , and the locking tab on the connector has a shield to help prevent accidental disconnections . I have had no troubles with the quality of the connection , and the Apple TV transmits a high-definition signal every time.At this price , the cable is a bargain . For some reason , I 've seen CAT 5 cable of this length sell for more than $ 25.00 in brick-and-mortar stores ( and one time I had to pay the extortionate price because I was in a pinch ) .You can purchase this cable secure in the knowledge that you 're going to get a quality product .	1
Should have copied my comments from the other CAT 5e cable I endorsed.High quality product , fair price and reliability are the reasons I chose this product .	1
Great cable , Super cheap . I got it for less than $ 2 as an add on . Ca n't beat hardwiring game consoles .	1
this ended up being alot shorter than what i needed but i 'm sure i will find some use for it in the future , very nice looking and well put together	1
Works just fine , nice blue color , and no trees in the rain forest were used in the manufacturing of the product . Not much else to say .	1
I 'll make this short and fast much in the same way this cable works . First and foremost : it works and works well . It may be only be 3 feet long and that is totally my fault but it fits exactly as I need it . If I were lucid when I measured the location I would have chosen a longer cord and had a little extra but for what I needed at the time and now the length is perfect . I have a virtual cable factory behind my electronics and when making any changes it is a nightmare because it seems as if everyone will get hung up at the connector but NOT this Belkin . It is snagless and that is fantastic for the lazy or impatient . Those elements alone would be worth buying this cable ; however , when the value is added in this is a fantastic buy and I highly recommend it under any circumstances that work .	1
I bought a few of these along with some 25 , 50 , and 100 ft cables as part of my home surveillance project a while back.There 's very little that could impress you about a 3ft cable , but I will say that Belkin , in general , provides great cat cable at extremely good prices.I 'm a Belkin customer for life .	1
These are great for completing a distribution panel - long enough to reach from corner to corner but easy enough to coil if the connection is much closer .	1
Ok , so it did n't disintegrate when I opened the package . The twisty ties were twisty and tied . The clips on both ends clipped properly . It did not break the first time I used it . It did n't break when I had to unplug and re-plug it . It fits most brands of cable management systems . And data flows through it nicely.I love it .	1
Always Great to get the right size when a longer one is unnecessary and unmanageable . Belkin 's Products are very consistent in both quality and price . They hit it all with this one . We have used several of these at work .	1
You can feel that this cable is made to last . It ahs durabel tips and they feel strong . This works well with all our needs .	1
Like the title suggests , why would any comsumer want to pay more for a product that does exactly the same thing ? Sure , there may exist purists that really believe a more expensive patch cable yields better signal delivery , but they 'll have a hard time convincing me of an iota of difference . Belkin is a reliable name that produces a reliable product at a highly competitive price . I would buy , and will buy , these cables again and again .	1
This ethernet cable is a great value and works like a charm . Had it for 2 years and have never had a problem with it .	1
It is well made , soft flexible material instead of cheesy hard plastic . The length is about right for a patch cord .	1
ethernet cables work very well with my xbox.they looks Great and i hope the color of the items.thanks so much .	1
This ethernet patch cable works great . I have no problems with the signal running through it . It seems like a solid , well constructed cable . The cable I got is as specified in the product description .	1
I just installed a network between my two home computers , and this cable did the job perfectly . It worked just like it is supposed to , and the 50ft length gave me all the cable I needed , with plenty left in case I decide to re-arrange the desk locations . WELL worth the $ 10.99 price .	1
These where exactly what I needed for my blu-ray player . The price was great and could not be beat at any store that I looked at .	1
I use it to run to my router and keep my family happy haha thank you for selling this item to me	1
I bought this ethernet cord for my home network and it has worked flawlessly . Not much else I can say ... it works as you would expect it to , and the price is great .	1
I opted for this one after reading reviews of some of the other cables made by other manufacturers . It is the cable ends that are usually of concern . The Belkin cables are fine . The ends are very well made and snap into their sockets nicely . I have used it to hardwire an internet streaming box to my router . It is functioning just fine .	1
Got ta put in 20 words , , so what can I say , it is a pre made item , made by a great cable maker , so this thing will work great and it was a great price , usually stores are out to kill you on price so this fit the bill to connect two rooms together on my network .	1
Worked perfectly to run from a desk , around a wall to an Oki dot-matrix impact printer . Not a single problem . Typical great Belkin quality .	1
Paying ( little cash ) , I was not expecting a great deal of volume from this speakers . Consider this , some cheap non amplified speakers cost near $ 15 dollars and for double that price , you would expect about double the quality . Well , let me tell you , this baby more than quad-triples the sound of those speakers.The Creative labs PC WORKS 1000 system comes complete with the 2 satelitte cubes , the subwoofer , power adapter , audio inputer cable , mounting stands , velcro attachments and screws . Installation was very easy , just plug the speakers in the back of the sub , plug in the power adapter in the power source and the audio cable in the sub and the source.The included manual is quite small but is adequate enough to help you set up and get the system running . They have recommendations on placement and volume . I plugged my system into a discman first . When I first turned it on I was amazed at the power of the bass . The OOMPHS really shocked me.Concerning the volume , this is one of the problems I have with the system . First off , the volume is somewhat hard to find the appropriate setting . ( There is a bass adjustmant on the sub and a volume control on the audio cable ) Finding a balance in bass and treble is quite hard . When the bass level is at 50 % ( as set when you first get the system ) , the bass tends to overpower the treble at lower volumes while the treble overpowers the bass at high volumes . Solving this problems involves alot of tweaking and depends on the type of music you listen to.My second problem with this system is the supplied velcro strips . These were supposed to be used to mount to a wall . I was obviously skeptical at the concept but I tried it anyway . About 3 days after mounting them to the wall , on one of the speakers , the velcro pad unstuck from the speaker so the speaker fell . After re-sticking it , almost a day later , the velcro pad stuck to the wall unstuck so the other speaker fell . After this happened , it is obvious that the actual sticking surface which attaches to the wall/speaker is too weak , not the velcro . If you decide to use the velcro , let the pads stick to the surfaces for atleast 2 days before mounting the speaker to the wall.Those 2 problems are my only ones , other than that the volume is excellent . You will be suprised about the amount of volume you can get from this system . Its hard to explain , ... hear the sound , you will be amazed ... ..In conclusion , if you think about it , the cost of these speakers warrant it to be a typical speaker system for any computer and can easily be used for a small home theatre system . The speakers are magnetically shielded so you can mount them to your monitor . If you got extra cash and you want neighbours 2 or 3 houses down the road to hear you , consider pumping out that cash for a more expensive system . But for regular people like me on a budget , this system is an excellent solution for any sound need .	1
I bought these for the price and really did get more than what I paid for . If you 're shooting for looks , you wo n't get it . These speakers are ugly and i hate the external volume control ... makes for too many wires running around if your like me and have ethernet cables and a bazillion extension cords already . As far as sound goes I thought they were far more than serviceable . If you really like to turn it up I would recommend something a little more powerful , but if you have them in a smaller room and such they 'll do great . Great price , nice sound , ugly packaging , but a definite recommendation overall .	1
High-quality stylus , 3 of them even ! They even seem better than the one that was actually included with my Palm Pilot . A stylus is an easy thing to misplace , lose , just like a pen , so its great to have a few in your briefcase or purse !	1
After reading every review we could find , we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera . We were definitely not disappointed.After just a few days the camera accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia and Seoul , S. Korea , while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home . The camera performed marvelously . We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs , as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings . We took shots at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was readable ! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian & quot ; ger & quot ; ( tent ) , we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky -- even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable ! Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper . I doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard developed snapshot . The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use and functional for most home use . You will absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots ! One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one . If you frame ... say , a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder , you will discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area . Olympus should do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that , you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries -- shop around for the best price . Also , picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory card will be a big time saver . You simply pull out the flash memory card , slip it into the adapter , and then slide the floppy into any computer . You 'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your table , plus a significant download time.One last item -- Do you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs ? Olympus , through their website , is offering an inexpensive upgrade through the end of December that will allow the camera to use the new 32MB memory cards .	1
I 've owned the camera for one week and it has worked very good so far . I agree with the other customers about the manual ... it would be a lot better if it had a section for each language , not three languages together in one page . But the camera is very easy to use , takes excellent pictures and has many nice features . With a tripod , you can take great pictures at night without the flash ! The software is also very easy to use . Although it 's not documented in the manual , the camera comes with a TWAIN driver , so you can choose to download the photos with the bundled application or with your favorite photo editing software .	1
I love this player ! I travel frequently and the L50 keeps me company in the airport lounge and on the Airplane . The folks that make the PowerXtender laptop adapters for airplanes are going to be shipping one for the L50 so you wo n't need to take extra batteries on those long flights . The screen is very nice looking , and the 16x9 format lets you view anamorphic format DVDs in their best possible resolution . Of course , the wide screen also causes you to curse the DVDs that AREN't anamorphic ( e.g. , Titanic ) . The sound from the built-in speakers is ok , but sounds very good from a pair of headphones . For travelers I recommend a pair of the Sony Noise Cancelling Ear Buds .	1
We use this in our alarm clock for when the power goes out as it often does . So far this little rechargable has n't needed a recharge & is doing a fine job making sure when get up on time when the power goes out & then back on while were sleeping . I gave it 4 stars because we have n't had it long enough to get a really good opinion on it aside from the one just given .	1
I bought two of these batteries with the Overnight Nimh Family Battery Charger , and so far the batteries have performed as expected . have n't used it enough to see if they take memory if charged to frequently but so far so good . Great product ! So now I have used this product for 5 months on a Microphone to line amplifyer and they last about 2 days on average . The batteries take 10 to 13 hours for a full charge which is pretty ridiculous ! luckly I only use one at a time so I have time to charge the other one.I would still say Great Product !	1
I teach 4 one-hour classes a week , which require a 9-Volt battery for the mic . I got tired of buying these every week or two , so I bought the rechargable . The single charge lasts the entire week . I recharge it on the weekends and I 'm ready to go ... no problems so far . I 've had it for 3 months or so..	1
Do n't travel with the cradle , and do n't wait until you return from a trip to synch with your laptop . Just roll up one of these and stick it in your laptop case . This is especially useful for Palm VIIs , which ca n't use the version of PalmOS that supports synching through the IR port.This cable does not have a synchronize button . In order to use it , connect the cable , turn on your Palm , press the HotSynch icon , and press the LocalSynch icon.Remember that leaving your Palm in the cradle or leaving this cable connected to both your Palm and your computer will put an extra drain on your batteries , so you should unhook your Palm as soon as you finish synching .	1
Lightweight , portable and simple . These words describe both the HotSync cradle that came with my Palm IIIx and this cable which I just purchased . However , if you travel a lot , and sync to a laptop or second computer , this cable is the way to go.I takes up virtually no room in a laptop bag , and can fit in virtually any luggage pocket ( and also a suit pocket ) .There is no other software to install . Just pull the cable out of the bag , attach to your PC and Palm and sync using the HotSync icon on the Palm itself.One way that it could be improved would be with a button on the cable end itself which would trigger the HotSync . This would most likely make the cable more expensive and possibly less reliable over the long term , however . All in all , a well-designed and utterly useful product .	1
I travel quite often , and lugging around the weighty Hot Sync/Charger cradel adds some pounds to my briefcase . With the travel kit , the charger and Hot Sync cable are seperate , and much lighter , without the stand like the cradle . Works just as good as the cradle too . I like the fact that the charger comes with 3 extra plugs , which can be used for different countries ! Great travel kit at a reasonable price .	1
... you simply ca n't beat this deal ! GREAT LITTLE TRIPOD ! Does the job perfectly as a lightweight `` back-up '' tripod.I do have another big , heavy tripod for windy days but plan to carry this one on hiking trails and long distance trips.Just what I needed .	1
These Teac drives are great . I have them for about 2 months and no problems . Just remember - No cable comes with purchase so make so you have a cable .	1
I was having sporadic problems with my old floppy drive ( also a Teac ) so , suspecting the problem was with the drive itself , rather than the motherboard , controller , cable , driver , etc. , I went ahead and bought this one from Amazon ... . Well , it installed without a hitch , and now works flawlessly . File transfers are somehow much , much faster -- faster than with my drive at work , and especially compared to my old drive . Funny that floppy drives do n't carry X speed ratings like CD-ROMS -- if they did this one might be an & quot ; 8X & quot ; .	1
Not much to say here , it works for me . I was able to access my old floppy drives . Windows detected it without needing to search for drivers .	1
does not work with Win & out of the box - have yet to find anything to make it work - find an older machine ( XP ) and see if you can extract your data .	1
Work well right out of the box after computer searched for and downloaded drivers . Only used once for single floppy with much needed data . Durability unknown . Price was right .	1
Had a client who brought me a 3.5 & # 34 ; disk and told me he had to have the data off of it . Never thought I would have to buy a floppy drive or even use one . Crazy , but this did exactly what I needed it for even in Windows 8.1 . I figured when I plugged this into an 8.1 machine , Windows would basically tell me , & # 34 ; What is this ? 1.44 MB , hahahah & # 34 ;	1
So you have your tax records on a floppy , and you need to get that DATA ! Whip this bad boy out and you are good to go !	1
TheSabrent External USB 1.44 MB 2x Floppy Disk Drive ( FL-UDRV ) Blackis a totally Plug and Play device which operates perfectly under Microsoft Windows 7 ( x86 and x64 ) , and also gives the user a straightforward way to boot up modern PCs from diskettes , provided that the unit is connected directly to the motherboard , with no intermediate hubs , i.e . the drive MUST be connected to the USB ports on the back of the PC in order to be bootable.NOTE : When using the drive under Microsoft Windows 7 , sometimes a prompt will come up saying that the diskette is not formatted and asking the user to format it . If you know the disk might have useful data on it , cancel the prompt and open up the Windows Explorer ( Windows Key+E ) to let Windows reread the disk contents , and voil & agrave ; , the disk contents will be presented promptly in the Explorer window . I am pretty sure this behavior is due to Windows 7 , not the drive , since using it under XP did n't exhibit the symptom and , certainly , booting the PC from the same diskettes ( which I 've already done ) would n't be possible if the drive could n't read the disk .	1
Buried deep within the User Manual ( available online at Sabrent 's web site ) is the troubleshooting observation that you MUST wait & # 34 ; one full minute & # 34 ; ( use a timer ) between plugging it in and inserting a 1.44 MB floppy ( it does NOT support ANY other density ) .Follow that directive and the device will work pretty much like any ordinary floppy.Before reading that directive , I was about to join those who swore the device would not work at all . It had repeatedly failed to read ANY floppy . The only other problem I 've encountered ( in only 1 hour of testing ) is that the device driver ( written by Microsoft ) hung on one occasion , requiring a reboot to resolve.I would also note that the User Manual available online is for a Teac drive while the drive they sent me is a Mitsumi drive . That said , the Teac User Manual seems entirely applicable to the Mitsumi drive . But , if you search the Sabrent web site for the model number of the Mitsumi drive ( FL-UDRV ) , you will find ( at this time ) no information on that model number at all .	1
Just hooked it up and it works great . We 've got the Reds game on the television inside and the audio coming through the speaker outside so we wo n't miss anything ! So far so good .	1
Being able to enjoy music with a wireless speaker is fantastic . The speaker is small enough to be innocuous but delivers pretty good quality sound . On occasion , especially very humid days , it 's harder to get the receiver to pick up the signal , but overall we 're happy with the product.If you can buy the speaker at a deep discount , like we did , then you 'll be happy with the product .	1
If you are looking for the best camcorder in the market , stop looking this little toy has it all . The quality of the picture and sound are so great the you will feel and see every thing that you filmed as if you where there LIVE again . If you have a home theatre system with Adobe Digital 5.1 you will really see what I mean . The only down side is you will need a battery that lasts longer and make sure you get more tape .	1
This must have been the best handycam for the price when I bought it ! And I love the death out of it ! All I can say is that this camera would still be great if it were still manufactured , 3 years later ! If you find one someone who is selling this camera in good condition , by all means get it ! It 's a great camera !	1
Did exactly as it is advertised . Be aware , however , that there is only one ( tiny ) brush on the disk . Other brands have a few , or many ( if that matters to you ) . I 've always had good luck with Maxell .	1
The Sony DVD-S550 is a great buy for first and second time DVD player buyers alike . It offers a tremendous combination of features and performance at a very reasonable price . I had a year and a half old Panasonic DVD player that decided to stop working and I realize now that it really did me a favor . Seeing and hearing movies on this Sony has really opened my eyes and ears to all that DVDs can offer . I mention ears because as amazing as the video quality is , the sound quality is what really blows me away ( and you do n't need a humongous sound system to appreciate it ) . You will not be disappointed by this product ! It provides very near the quality level of the Sony Reference DVD-S7700 ( at half the price ) and features ( inc. a jog dial remote ) that put it over the Sony DVD-S530 ( at least in my book ) .	1
I do n't know about the rest of you but I have been researching products to allow me to play music for about 2 months and I 've had a hard time making a decision . I 've looked a mp3 , minidisc , and regular cd players . I finally chose to jump in and buy this mainly because I did n't want the mp3 craze to pass me by : ^ ) . Here 's what I think : Styling : Look good . It is almost exactly the size of a cigarette box but the depth is about 3/4 less . The clippable pouch that comes with it is okay but you need to undo the velcro tie to turn it on and completely pull it out to vary the volume . The pouch is quite cushion-any and probably saved me when I dropped it . It does feel and look durable . The blue backlit screen looks attractive . The mp3 file names scroll across the screen rather slowly but , again , a minor point.Sound : Apart from the miserable headphones ( my main problem was static as the headphone jack swiveled around the entry socket ) the sound is good to great . I was n't looking for & quot ; knock your socks off & quot ; sound anyway but I am quite happy with it . The highest volume setting is not as loud as I 'd like it but it does n't bother me to any great extent.Loading music : Loading is quick thru the USB port . I use RealJukebox Plus ( the one that costs money ) along with an add-on to manage music loading and I am very happy with it . I did n't like the Rio Audio Manager but it works fine . Setup was a piece of cake . Very intuitive and fast.Memory : 64MB allows me to place almost any CD I have in memory . I have a mixture of 128KBS and 192KBS sampling rates on my mp3s and at 192 a single CD is about all that fits on there . The expansion port for memory upgrades will come in handy.Overall : Nothing really to complain about . A nice little gadget that I 'm very happy with .	1
I still prefer my Rio 500 and have yet to & quot ; upgrade & quot ; to any of the newer MP3 players . It is light , smaller than a deck of cards and easy to use . I used it primarily to listen to Audible ( audio books ) while commuting and it has been flawless [ with the exception that one time it refused to boot up properly , with a checkerboard screen ] . A quick search at Rio 's website ( rioworld.org ) revealed a recovery utility , which I ran and recovered my Rio 's firmware . Whew !	1
In it 's own world , the Rio is great . Just an MP3 Player with 65 Meg ram . Needs better headphones , although they feel snug and secure . Also , it would have been nice to have a recording feature with built in Mic or Input for a Lapel Mic . That would blow minidisk out of the water . I must say however that this is the future at its best . No moving Parts , removable Smart Media Cards used to expand memory . The Future of music does not involve any motors of any kind to spin a disk . I 've allready downloaded a ton of online books and music , and the quality is great ... ... and remember , MP3 's can be be converted back to a standard .Wav file with just about any MP3 editor ... .Try Music Match ... ... A great product David_Carlin @ vtel.com	1
The Rio500 is a great MP3 player - in this reviewer 's opinion , the best on the market currently . Its size ( smaller than a pack of cigarettes ) and weight ( about an oz . ) recommend it to shirt-pocket musicophiles and , especially , athletes ! ( You can jog all day with nary a skip , and with the included netting belt-clip , it will definitely NOT pull your jogging shorts down , weighing about the same as a pager . ) Interface with any USB Macintosh is seamless , and the included software , Casady & amp ; Greene 's SoundJam MP , is the finest Mac application in decades . All you need to know is how to work the plug , and how to drag and drop , and you 'll be organizing your Rio playlists with no trouble . If it is n't already , SoundJam will become your MP3 player of choice , too.The Rio takes SmartMedia cards and can reportedly handle any size , including the upcoming 100+ MB cards ; mine works perfectly with a 32 MB Sandisk SmartMedia card . ( 96 MB is just about perfect for listening to a full 72-minute CD recording , say of Beethoven 's Fifth , at 160 kbps sound quality . ) I also get great sound out of a phones-to-cassette adapter , which I use to playback MP3 's in my car . My only complaint is that the included ear-beads are terrible , both acoustically and for the fact that they just wo n't stay in ! Alternative headphones can be used , but drain the power source ( 1 AA battery ) rather quickly . A solution might be NiMH high capacity rechargables .	1
Not being a computer or camera & quot ; pro & quot ; I needed something easy to use . I looked at the reviews for the product here at Amazon . I decided to buy the F83 model . This model allows for a 15 second & quot ; movie & quot ; . Boy do I like it . I like the ease of the Floppy disk . The quality is fine for my needs . The battery lasts a long time . A camera bag is a necessity since the LCD screen marks easily . I recommend the camera to anyone wanting a digital camera that is easy to use . Thanks Amazon for providing the reviews , and thanks to those other individuals who made the reviews . I found them very helpful .	1
This is great camera with many features . You can take the pictures in many conditions . The flashlight is good enough for Indoor shooting . You can use the A-REC mode for automatic shooting & amp ; M-REC mode for manual Shooting . You will have a great photos just using A-REC mode . Just switch on the bottom & amp ; ready to take photos . If you want more professional photos use M-REC mode . You can adjust for the manual shutter speed or manual aperture . In this feature you customize your photos even you can bright your object at the poor light . The 2.11 mega pixels is good enough for viewing in the web , sending though E-mail & amp ; print in A4 paper . The worst think that I know is a battery live . This camera it 's so hungry with power , that I thought same with the others digicam . For your convenient use a 3 set of NIMH batteries , which can take 30 to 40 pictures each set in normal used . You can save your battery live with minimize using LCD monitor to framing the object .	1
I also own a Sony Mavica and a Kodak DC260 so this is n't my first digital camera . With the 950 I found that I needed to read the manual with care because much of the interface is restrictive and confusing if you try to just & quot ; go for it. & quot ; After blowing through several dozen test pics , I started to find the tricks to metering , autofocus and Nikon 's digital simulation of shutter and aperture settings found on a traditional camera . The quality of the pictures , once you get the hang of using the camera in a particular setting , is amazing . This is the highest digital quality I 've experienced with a digital camera .	1
This camera takes excellent quality digital pictures and comes with the Nikonview software which enables you to make basic edits on the pictures on your computer . It is fairly easy to use and the compact flash uploads into the computer either via a reader or directly from the camera . I have seen some digital pictures which made me wonder why you would bother , the quality was so poor . This camera is the best I have seen and I would highly recommend it .	1
I just received this camera about a week ago . Since then I'vereplaced the 8mb memory card with a 96mb card . This camera definitelytakes some getting used to . I 'm taking mostly photo 's of my new twinsand find that I 'm either afflicted with the palsy or the camera is super sensitive to shaking . Suggest trying a tripod ( that is my next investment ) .I think you also need to experiment with things like shutter speed to get the maximum picture out of the camera . I have had very mixed results with closeups but blame myself for not having gotten the hang of this yet.Overall it is a really nice unit , solidly built . You 'll need a bigger memory card , probably a USB card reader and NIMH batterys ( do n't let them sell you NICADS - get the 1500mah NIMH along with a 1 hour rapid charger ) .You wo n't be sorry with the camera !	1
I use this item at work and its a good product that serves it purpose . i would recommend this item	1
This label cartridge is great . It prints white labels with black ink . I was out of stock and could n't find them at CVS , Walgreens , or even Officemax . So I bought a few of them in bulk at Amazon .	1
What can I say it 's the perfect refill and gets the job done ! This comes highly recommended for your brother P-touch labeler	1
Works great . Make sure you have the correct size - there are at least 2 different size tapes ( M & TZ ) and they are not interchangeable .	1
love this and the silver refills i see alot of reorders in the future ! ! !	1
Official brother M-tape does the job right in the label maker . Cheaper than all the local office stores . Organization is priceless .	1
M tape for Brother P-Touch . Not much to say other than it loaded right into our P-touch Home & Hobby model PT-65 labeler . Prints fine .	1
I like having two labelers - the larger Brother P-touch which takes TZ tape cartridges and the smaller brother P-touch which takes M tapes . I 've found the lowest price for both tapes is on amazon.com . I keep a red on white tape in one and a black on white tape in the other .	1
Does what its intended to , with no pain or suffering , depending on the host unit I imagine . Recommended highly for whoever needs this particular model .	1
I use this for labeling boxes in my workshop . The labels stick and the printed stickers make things look a lot more organized .	1
I 've used this tape for years and have an older Brother labeler to prove it . Using the tape on clean surfaces is a no-brainer but its not intended to be used on items that have high usage , the printing will eventually wear off , but a new one is easily made up .	1
this replacement tape was a perfect fit for my brother label machine . it was a lot less expensive then if I bought it in the store .	1
I love my P-Touch labeler , and use it all the time.This is a much better price than local on the label refills , so I buy them here.Recommended	1
Works Great for the Brother Personal Labeler Machine , White ( PT90 ) ! Just like the original one that came with the labeler and great replacement	1
I love my Brother label maker and use it in our rental homes . This replacement tape is original Brother ( though I have used knock offs and they work perfectly too )	1
I got my wife the Brother P-Touch labeler ( PT-1200 I think ) to use in organizing things ; primarily the 50 or so 18-gallon plastic tote bins we use to store things in the basement and garage.We 've found through a few years of experience that the 1/2 & # 34 ; is superior in longevity to the smaller width tapes for labeling these plastic bins -- little to know spontaneous peel-off that you get with a smaller width tape.I think it has something to do with the surface area to volume ratio for the adhesive and the slightly irregular and porous nature of the recycled plastic bins.In any case , we like this -- aside from the durability -- you can print LARGE FONT so you can easily identify the contents from the label from a distance ( saves having to take everything out etc . )	1
Great product . Very good text . Backing is very easy to remove and stick labels on to stuff .	1
It 's only 1/2 '' wide , but you get great black letters on a sparkling white background . That slit down the rear -- easy splitting backer means no more broken fingernails , no more using the family chisel to expose the adhesive . What cooler sound than the whirr of a Brother 1280 as your freshly minted label shoots out the side slot , ready to take on the world . File folders , basement shelves , neighborhood cats -- 231 organizes them all with finesse . You wo n't find a better TZ label tape than TZ231 . Stick it with pride !	1
I love my Brother Labelmaker and this tape is great . Good value for the amount of tape . I 'm label happy and it takes me ages to use up .	1
This OEM tape is just as expected and pricing was better than anything local . We have had nothing but great results with this tape and our Brother labeler .	1
This tape is great.It 's 5 stars great.I have 3 colors of MK Tape for my PT70 -1 ) MK231 Black on White2 ) MK631 Black on Yellow3 ) MK232 Red on WhiteAll 3 kinds are really good products.And I 'm glad I have all three.It 's incredibly easy & quick to switch cartridges in the machine.Just pull one out & stick the other one in.No threading tape through slots or rollers or anything like that.No loose ends of tape dangling out anywhere.No wasted tape whatsoever.It 's really a very good simple design.This review is about the Black on Yellow 1/2-inch tape.But I must comment here that the PT70 machine is really a nice little unit in every respect.This MK631 Black on Yellow label tape is very easy to read.Label separates off the backing very easily too.Tape sticks well but you can still remove it to reposition it.I 'm 100 % happy with it.Ca n't quite decide whether I like the Black/White or the Black/Yellow the best.Both are very easy to use , very easy to read.Both very nice items.No doubt about it.C SmithMaryland	1
I ordered different widths and colors to mark videotapes for processing . Some videotapes will be processed at a commercial facility ; some I will process myself . This was I can use color codes to identify which is which .	1
It is what it is . It works but when removing the tape months later , it seems to leave residues . I had no problems other wise .	1
Works great on my label maker .	1
Works as advertised . I try to be organized & having a labler that is quick & easy to use helps .	1
I use to but this Black on Clear labeling tape and the old stuff was better for me . The Clear part was really clear - now it 's sort of a matte clear but it 's OK for most things you put it on .	1
I 'm replacing a cartridge for my label maker and this is the right color and size , with a reasonable price .	1
I thought & # 34 ; non - laminated & # 34 ; mean dull surface . It is pretty high gloss . Silver has slight pearl color shift to it . Very nice !	1
I use this on my motorcycle to listen in on the road captain 's conversations while tripping down the road with the HOGS . It works very well , especially as a simple monitor , and the & # 34 ; channel switching - swapping & # 34 ; is handy since they change from 22 to 25 and do n't tell anyone . Compact - nice package .	1
Flexibility comes at a cost in performance and this is no exception . Good product , put together nicely and has tons of features . Minor annoyances : the clip behind the radio is not the best feature , the LCD light does not stay on long enough , and the speaker volume should be louder . Lots of upsides ( well covered in other reviews ) with some minor but annoying downsides .	1
Nice compact little radio that fits on most motorcycles . Ride in a club where many members have these . One of the only suitable CB for a bike that does n't come with an OEM CB . Range will depend on antenna . Rubber unit that attaches to the radio and is part of the package is good for short distances . Would guess 1/4 mile or so depending on the terrain and conditions . Weather band is a nice feature as is the cigarette lighter external antenna connector . Also comes with two battery packs and a charger for the pack that uses 8 AA rechargeable batteries . I am currently trying eneloop batteries in the unit . The other battery pack holds 6 regular AA batteries . Both battery packs as well as the cigarette adaptor slide on and off easily so you have plenty of options . I do n't see why 6 rechargeable batteries could n't be used i the 6 battery holder . You would just have to charge them in the other pack or a regular charger .	1
A nice little small radio that works well and and it took minimal effort to hook it up in our vehicle .	1
I did n't want to mess up my dash or drill holes for mounts . This product fit the bill perfectly ! The volume knob was cracked , and I was n't going to send it back for that so I purchased some 6mm knobs , and trimmed the base ring off of them , and they look even better than the originals . See : B008DFA0Y0The best part about this unit is the battery packs , one for normal AA , and one for rechargeable NICAD , and a charger too . This allows you to go portable and mobile . The wiring set up for in the vehicle works great , and allows you to put the handset between the driver seat and console , and remove it if you do n't want to leave it in the vehicle . The fact that I can use it out of the vehicle too , is what made me buy this one vice the similar Cobra product . So far it works great , and I 've gotten pretty good range mated up to a tuned Firestik Antennae . Having weather bands as well is a plus . Great for 4x4 folks in the field .	1
I use it with my mobile unit to keep in contact with the others when we go in the mountains to go rock hounding use mobile for the base unit	1
Nice small unit . The range is n't that great but it picks up the weather stations . Fits right in the glove box .	1
I 've had CB 's since the late 1970 's ... Cobras , Unidens , and most others . Midland does , and always has made a good product . This is no different . The handhelds are great if you are in an RV campsite looking for others , or on the road , searching for traffic info.Face it , the 1970 's are gone - and even then , power jacked skip talkers ruined a lot of 'otherwise friendly ' local chats . In the area I 'm working near Canada , I get really tired of 2000-watt skip talking power hounds out of Orlando Florida blasting so hard to talk to someone in LA , that you ca n't hear your neighbor a mile away . Face it , we are n't buying bad radios , we are being stomped on by illegal users like these guys.Do n't think badly of the Midland 75HH . It is a good little 4-watt radio . It 's output with a 'Lil Wil ' magnet mount antenna is comparable to a Cobra 29LTD with a suitable tuned antenna . Get your SWR 1.1:1 or so on 20 , get 1 and 40 as close as you can , and you should have no problems reaching out a few miles . On a good day , you can get 3-5 miles ... and that 's all they are really designed for . Do n't forget , the more sunspots , the further you can reach ... and sunspots are starting to pick up now ... Good radio ... I gave it 4-stars , because they 've never offered this handheld with a mated external magnet-mount antenna ... maybe I expect too much ... ( but you can get almost the same thing in a dash mount , and add an antenna , for the same price ) .	1
I really like this CB . It has the ability to transmit quite well with a dedicated whip . If you like this sort of thing like I do you will really enjoy its compact size and features . Technology is a trip .	1
I gave this as a gift that was well-received . I have been told that it works great and is appreciated .	1
This controller really became valuable to me after the first 3 or 4 viewing sessions with my new ETX-90EC . After the newness of just pointing the telescope at the brightest object in the sky wore off , the controller assisted me with finding all kinds of new objects to look at . It took some work for me to get the telescope aligned with the controller . I had to learn the reference stars that the controller uses to align the telescope . Once I learned the reference stars , the unit becomes essential for me to really enjoy this hobby . I can not imagine using my telescope without this controller !	1
There are two schools of thought on the use of go-to telescopes . One school believing that it takes away all the skill and fun from astronomy . however , I 'm a believer in the other viewpoint . I think go-to capability opens up astronomy to the masses and brings the universe just that little bit closer to everyone . I purchased the Autostar for my ETX about a year ago and it has had extensive use . Out of the many many times I have used the autostar with the scope , I estimate it has performed as desired on 90 % of my viewing nights . Unusually , I seem to be able to align my ETX rather easily depsite the fact that many people have difficulty . I think I have had luck on my side as the ETX , while a beautiful scope , can be a little temperamental . Even after doing a quick and rough alignment , like pointing it in the general direction of due North , without using a compass , I still get very accurate results with the autostar . I even changed locations the other day , moving from Auckland to Taupo , ( some 3 hrs travel distance by car ) and inadvertantly used the Auckland co-ordinates while viewing in Taupo . Suprisingly after alignment , I still got accurate positioning from the autostar . Once you get the hang of the menu system the autostar is really quite simple to navigate around . The amount of data is staggering , but given the size of the playground , it 's not suprising . The unit itself is comfortable to hold and the adjustable brightness makes reading the screen simple in the dark . I hav n't found the built in red light at the top of the unit very good as it is just too dim to make out charts etc . The trusty old torchlight with red nail polish on the lens is hard to beat on that score . I suggest that if you are operating from a tripod , you attach something to the back of your autostar that lets you hang it up on the tripod when you are not using it . Otherwise it can dangle around and get in the way . On a couple of occassions I have had the unit fail to operate correctly or reset itself . These have been far and few between , and readily fixed itself . Ultimately the Autostar is a computer so an occasional reset is not entirely unexpected . One minor problem I am experiencing at the moment is the scrolling text on the lower line of the display panel is tending to fade a little the faster it scrolls . This has occured since I started using a power adapter for the scope so this will need investigating . This however is only a minor niggle . If you have any concerns about your Autostar consultthe best resource on the net for the autostar , Mike Weasners site . The Autostar is highly recommended and really an essential purchase to go along with your ETX . Clear skies everyone and happy alignments .	1
Nothing sucks more than when you are sipping on some tea studying at a coffee shop and you need to go pee . However , you do n't want to leave your lab top unattended . Thank god I now have this cable to secure my investment . Its lightweight and convenient .	1
You 'll always have your power cable with your notebook . What about another cable that helps with security.Leave your laptop alone . It 's going to be safe . I use it on my office , college and even home so nobody is going to move it from its place.If still paranoic , try the Kensington Soniclock Motion Detecting Alarm . Just like the alarm in your car . Both great security tools .	1
Kensington is the best , price is good , the lock is easy and works smoothly . Another great product from Kensington !	1
Locks the laptop to a table or a bar or whatever you wrap the cable around . Secure and reliable lockset .	1
Pros : Thicker than many other cable locks I 've owned . Locks and unlocks easily , so you do n't have to spend five minutes trying to lock , and then another five minutes trying to unlock , your computer . It DOES wiggle around on my netbook , which is why the rubber bumper is really nice , but does n't wiggle around on my laptop . So whether you get the 'wiggle ' people were talking about depends on the computer slot you 're dealing with . It is superior in every way , though , to the Kensington combination lock with the coiled cable , which is what I bought before this one . That one chewed the heck out of the plastic casing on my computer around the slot because it was so difficult to lock ! ! So if you 're choosing between a Kensington combination and a Kensington key , go with the key . Your poor computer casing will thank you.Cons : As others have mentioned , it 's a little short . Also I 'm a bit concerned about the 'if someone tampers with it you can never unlock it again ! ! ' feature others have mentioned , but I 'll deal with that when it happens , if it does . Key is a little bulky to carry.I use this as part of a multi-tiered security system . Of course a lock alone wo n't stop someone with a bolt cutter . I 'm only hoping to slow down a casual 'snatch and grab ' thief who might try to take advantage of me taking a quick bathroom break in class or such .	1
This lock is very easy to use . the only two things you need to carry around are the key and the cable itself . Tie your laptop up wherever you go , especially the library ! I live on the ground floor , and my desk is right next to the window . So I keep my laptop locked up even when it 's at home , so that any would-be burglar would have a tough time breaking the window and taking off with my notebook . Although , if he really wanted to , he could probably get a pair of wirecutters powerful enough to cut the cable.All in all , this cable makes me feel secure against casual thieves and I recommend it for all laptop users .	1
Shipping was quick and packaging was very adequate for the product . The lock and cable appear to be of good quality . The keys work flawlessly and I prefer over the combination lock models . It was listed and purchased as a used item , but looks new and at half the cost of the new ones . How much abuse can a lock like this take ? I have always had good success with purchasing used items through Amazon . If there is ever a problem , it is accepted back immediately .	1
Durable comes to mind when receiving this product . Easy to install and uninstall . For the price a most have , and a great buy .	1
My product came packaged neatly in a clear plastic bag . Comes with two keys with bright orange tags . and a Paper Manual with the code to replace your keys if you ever lose them . Never got the link to the site to work , so codes were practically useless.The cable has two different ends . One end has a lock and attaches to your laptop and the other end is a loop.The end with the lock can swivel , so the lock revolves around the end if the cable ever gets tangled.I wrap the cable around the leg of my desk and pull it through the loop . This way , unless someone has a cable cutter or enough strength to rip the leg off the desk , they should not be able to steal the physical laptop . Unless they were aiming for the Hard Drive , graphics card , or DDR3 RAM ; that would be a different story.Cable is almost no different than the heavy duty bicycle security cables . It has a diameter of roughly ~ & # 60 ; 1 cm . So a decent cable cutter can cut the cable in half.This is only a simple way to ward off thieves in a very basic environment . Better than nothing. & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; Final Thoughts & # 60 ; & # 60 ; & # 60 ; I only got this since I needed to use my laptop on my desk at my part-time job , and I ca n't be bothered constantly locking my laptop in the cabinet every time I step away from the desk.Keeps thieves from stealing your entire laptop . If they were aiming at the components of your laptop , all they need is a Phillips screwdriver and plastic gloves . Or if they had a good compact cable cutter , which nowadays are quite small.For ~ $ 31 , not a bad deal . TO me was better than a retractable cable as those are weaker and thinner . The long cable is good if I ever needed the extra length.Fits in my ASUS 15.6 inch N53SV-EH72 laptop and my Acer 14 inch V5-471P-6498 laptop.May recommend to others , I do n't know how long it would keep thieves off my laptop but something is better than nothing . : D	1
I use it to convert old tapes to CD ( via computer ) , as well as playing CDs and cassettes on it . Having the two media in one unit is a real space saver and convenient , too . The mechanicals and sound performance are excellent . Headphones port with its own vol . contol a nice feature . Thanks , Teac .	1
I have always used wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes since I can remember , but I have found the Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner to work just fine . Generally , if you use a higher grade tape for home recording you are not going to run into problems . In fact playing a high quality tape through your machine will actually clean your tape heads . Most times when problems develop is when you rent tapes or play pre-recorded budget tapes in your VCR . You may notice picture deterioration or even loss of picture , sound and tracking by playing contaminated tapes or tapes of an inferior quality where the oxide gets transferred to your video heads , linear audio heads , rollers and guides . In these instances wet system VHS head cleaner cassettes have always corrected the problem for me , but I have found that this Maxell Dry Head Cleaner corrects those issues just as efficiently and completely . This Maxell VP-100 VHS Dry Tape Video Head Cleaner really does work and you can maintain your unit and fix the problem on your own.I have found that for best performance , it is best to use dry head cleaners as part of a routine maintenance of your VHS player/recorder . This allows you to stop build oxide up before it becomes a major problem . I have not had to use a wet cleaner in over 14 years now .	1
It works clean and prefect . What else can be said but get it .	1
There is no question that Maxell has made the best of cleaners for your electronics . They have definitely done it for years , with accessories , and continue to do so . While many people have stopped owning VCR 's , there are some that still do after all these years , and Maxell is still making those aids for it . This Maxell Dry Tape Head Cleaner handles very well , and works in a instant . It is very easy to read and understand , and should not die down . It will last around 100 times for use in your VCR , and definitely is worth the money . While , it can take a bit out of you if you do overuse it , it should keep you VCR from any flaws for at least 10 years . I have always loved what Maxell had made with their electronics accessories , and this should definitely be a great buy.Price : BConvience & Quality : B+Overall : B 1/2+	1
I 've been digitizing a lot of family movies , videos , etc. , and it is very important that the VHS player I 've been using has clean heads . We manually cleaned the heads when we started , but I purchased this to clean them intermittently during this very long process . The VHS player is running our tapes through very crisp and clear . I believe it 's doing what it 's supposed to do .	1
They do a good job . I put them below my deck and they have worked very wellfor two years . Great sound . I would buy them again . Great bargain for the price .	1
I 've been using these buds for around a year now and have really enjoyed them . They greatly reduce ambient noise and decrease conversational noise immensely . I especially recommend these buds to those travelling in carpools or public transportation !	1
Excellent price for a non audiophile . For me , sound is great and isolation is too . Nice snug fit . They tend to wiggle a but lose when I run so I use a headband to help hold them in . This works because they are so small and the headband does n't make it feel like a vise .	1
They are very comfortable and fit nicely and securely in the ear canal . This fit is better than silicon earbuds . The sound quality I 'd much better than any earbud in this price range .	1
You will read reviews of this product talking about how quickly the foam plugs bounce back , and that you ca n't get them in your ears fast enough ... Koss obviously made great improvements to the foam . THE FOAM IS NOW SLOW RECOVERY , meaning you can get it into your ear . This alleviates the only real downside to the product .	1
I find these ear buds to be very comfortable , decent at sealing out surrounding noise and have decent sound . One downside is that because the sound comes through a plastic straw-like tube , if you 're opening your mouth ( i.e . eating , yawning ) the tube will pinch and the sound will become muffled , but this is only temporary .	1
Now these are not balanced to start with , more boost in the muddy area ( 200hz-300hz ) . But with a little cut in this area they are sooooo good . They rival even my Sony MDR-7509HDs when this cut is applied . I also have an communications headset from Koss , SB-49 for $ 50 , which I 've used for gaming AND mixing audio . Koss just makes great sounding gear , but pay for the high end stuff to get out-of-the-box balanced .	1
I was looking for headphones that I could be comfortable with for long periods of time.I use my mp3 player for listening to audio books , and the headphones that came with it became very uncomfortable after just a short period of time in my ears . I also did n't want to spend a fortune.After much looking I decided to give these a try , and they have worked out great . They are comfortable for as long as I wear them which has been many hours at a time.The cables are too long , which seems to be the case with any heaphones I 've seen , so that 's something to live with . For the price I do n't think they can be beat .	1
Good base and good sound . I buy one and usually send them back to Koss for $ 9 ( lifetime warranty ) when they crap out . I 'm a heavy user and use these virtually every day anywhere from 1.5- 7 hours/day .	1
I do n't know if they still come with a lifetime warranty but I 'd buy them over again even if they didn't.It 's hard to find a pair of in-ear headphones that are rated 16 to 23,000 Hz . And if my memory serves me correctly , this design was groundbreaking and every one else copied them . I 've always enjoyed the isolating aspect as well as the bass response from them.I 've used the lifetime warranty a few times over the last 10 years and have had no problems .	1
For me , these feel better and achieve a better seal than the norm . A good seal is essential for achieving strong bass . They are rated a little more efficient ( the dB rating ) than many of the others , and this was noticeable .	1
Definitely not high-quality , but good enough for the average person . At such a low price I have an extra pair on hand in case my kids break one of theirs , so we have a total of 4 sets in the house . If you want audiophile quality , you 'll need to pay a lot more , but at less than $ 20 , these deliver decent sound and I do n't get sick every time I step on one or break a wire . For sound I 'd rate them 4 stars , for durability I 'd give them 2 stars , and price is a 5 .	1
these headphones to me are my favorite , after you get used to squeezing them and setting them up correctly in your ear . they reduce outside noise and sound great with bass . plus when you workout or mow the lawn you dont have to turn up your music as loud with other headphones , this is very nice with big yards and helps keep your hearing from getting damaged .	1
I was looking to control the volume out of my Samsung UN40EH6030 , which has a fixed volume output out of the 3.5mm jack . I wanted to used headphones when watching BluRays or playing 360 , so I got one of these instead of an expensive amplifier . Works beautifully ; no noise and the volume is sufficient . Excellent product for this type of use .	1
The product works as advertized . The adjustment wheel is fine enough that the volume can be tuned in very precisely . The wheel is recessed below the side surface of the body to avoid accidentally adjusting the volume and protect the wheel from damage . The cord is perhaps thinner than I would have expected but should be ok . The body of the device is very light plastic but seems rugged enough . If the product proves to be durable I will change my rating to a 5 ... . I recently updated the review to a 5 star rating . I have had no issues with this adapter .	1
I would have liked to see a larger dial that offers more levels , but if you need a simple volume control than this is the one .	1
This is a perfect companion piece for my f11 line-out dock and bluetooth transmitter/receiver for my ipod . Allows me to control the volume at the mobile end of the set-up . clip on back allows me to keep it handy.My only complaint is the small size of the volume control wheel . It could stand to be larger and have some sort of tactile method of adjusting the volume before pressing play .	1
I have one of these between my CarPC and AMP input . The soundcard was putting out to much power , turning the volume up to 10 out of 100 on the PC would almost blow the speakers . This thing was the quick and easy fix to give a little more breathing room to the PC volume . I have n't noticed any sound quality loss though I dont have the nicest of speakers to notice fine detail .	1
I initially used the KOSS Volume Control inline with headphones , in order to listen to the TV late at night , without disturbing others . We have a 5.1 speaker system , controlled by one speaker volume knob ( no remote control ) . It 's wired from the TV to a 1/8 '' Y/duplex plug ; one line continues to the speakers , the other goes to the headphones . Turn the speakers down all the way , and you only hear it through the headphones . Ok so far.But , guess what happens when you have the speakers up halfway , with the headphones plugged in , and you change the volume on the headphone using the KOSS Volume Control ? The volume of the external speakers changes ! Huh ? How is that possible ? It was odd at first , but if you lowered the KOSS unit 's volume , the speaker 's volume went up . Raise the KOSS volume , the speaker 's volume went down . It 's something to do with the amount of signal strength going to the headphones that sucks it from the 5.1 speakers . I had to add a label `` Loud '' and `` Soft '' , mounted just the opposite of the Low-to-High volume legend near the control wheel , since it controlled the speakers opposite of what you 'd think.So the KOSS Volume Control can function as a wired speaker volume control as well , provided that headphones are wired in parallel to the speakers . Who knew ? p.s . I like it so much , I 'm buying another .	1
Performs as advertised . Some people have noted a drop in audio quality , but to a person with average ears such as mine , your audio should sound almost exactly the same . The price is definitely fair.The one problem I 've encountered so far is that the volume dial is recessed from the side , so I have to use my fingernail to turn it . But it 's only a minor annoyance since the product works .	1
This product is great . When my wife & I both want to share a wired connection to an audio source , I do n't have to have her continually telling me to turn it down ... it 's too loud . I bought this for her to turn Her 's down while I enjoy it at a level I can hear . Too many years of loud music and loud guns with no hearing protection . Sometimes , it 's not always & # 34 ; convenient & # 34 ; to used hearing protection . They did n't have those high-tech ear-plugs back in the day and a lot of us older baby-boomers have lost significant hearing as a result .	1
I use headphones at night to watch TV and this helps because I can clip it to my PJ 's & adjust the sound level , on our 'ME ' TV channel the commercials are at a higher sound level then the show even though there is now a federal law against this practice ... . The wheel that makes the adjustment is VERY touchy , takes some practice to get used to it , so it lost a star because of that ...	1
I bought this to be able to control audio volume . Similar devices of other brands/no brands purchased in the past all just disintegrated ; Koss is built much better and so far so good . No complaints .	1
Simple in-line volume control . Works as its supposed too which is all we can ask . No issues with it at this time .	1
This allows me to control the volume on my head phone instead of have to use the mouse on the laptop.I like it alot . Is also used when hooked up to the headphones for the tv or the mp3 player . Very convenient.Recommend . works great .	1
I use it with Zoom H1 portable recorder , I had a serious issue with Zoom that its intake level is VERY HOT ! . So whne you get a line out from a mixer , you have no way to control the input gain ! This is perfect for that . also it is Very clean sound !	1
As the night wore on the FM became static ridden . I followed earlier reviews , popped the cover ( 3 screws ) and counter-rotated the VR2 about 1/4th turn . The signal improved dynamically and the static was gone !	1
I listen to my TV once in a while using my bose QC15 headphones . The problem with that set up is that volume can not be adjusted and plays at full blast . The Koss VC20 volume control module mitigated that issue . Works as described .	1
This is a surprisingly useful gadget , as it serves as an extension cord and volume control . The extension cord aspect adds about 3 feet to your headphone , which gives me a lot more room to move when I am listening to music on my computer . The volume control is handy when using a portable player because you can change the volume without jostling the player .	1
If you have audio equipment that does n't have a volume control ... for some odd reason , then this does the trick to fix that problem .	1
If you want a buffer between you and the audio source , get this product . Well made and it will save your hearing .	1
I was hoping to get more volume from my tablet with an auxillary conrol , but that was not the case . But , still a good product for extending the length of your speakers .	1
I got this because when we are recording music I dont like it loud in my eadphones and some time Freddy P wants it super loud in his ear . This way we can both have it as loud or as low as we want . Great deal .	1
I use it at work where I use in-ear earphones and this is very handy to lower the volume quickly when someone is talking to me . Very useful .	1
Not sturdy but has lasted a year so far without problems . Even the cheapie in-line volume control has not created any noise problems . The price is right and this extension can be used with any headset . I think Koss will replace the cord free if it goes bad .	1
My needs were simple , to lengthen the audio cord so I did n't have to worry about how i sat at work , and volume control . I sit at the computer a bit from time to time , and like to stream music.The cord is long enough , about 3ft I believe . The volume control is just that , basically it will not get louder than what the source is putting out , but it means I can adjust it , rather than adjusting the volume on the computer.It does everything it is supposed to , and in a small package . Worth the purchase .	1
I like good quality in the ear speakers but not all of them have the volume control on the wire leads . I bought a set of Klipsch in the ear speakers with no volume control . Having the inline control is a must for me because I wear them under my ear muff hearing protection when shooting pistol at the conservation club I belong to . So with the noise canceling ear speakers and the hearing protection muffs I need to turn the volume down without pulling out my smart phone when someone is trying to talk to me . They work well and I can not hear any difference if the ear speakers are directly plugged into my music source or if they are going through the volume control . I would recommend these to anyone that is looking for an in line volume control device .	1
The volume control works as described and is well made . The only complaint I have is with the long cord . If you need to control the volume of your device at a distance this is the control you should buy . Otherwise you will find yourself winding up the excess wire .	1
I have a very nice set of stereo headphones which , for reasons I can not understand , does not include an in-line volume control . I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control . The device works perfectly , just as it is supposed to . The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers . Overall , I 'm totally satisfied with this product .	1
I like it BUT it has a 3 foot cord . Add that to the 3 foot cord from my headset and I am dragging around 6 foot of cord . I have quit using it because I catch it on so many things . I will be looking for a shorter cord for the headset . It would have been nice if the cord was removable . I do n't really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my JVC headset is turning out to be a challenge .	1
I love having a volume switch available no matter what headphones I use . Also the cord is long enough to work as an extension . I 've always enjoyed Koss products ; the quality of sound from their headphones just sounds better to me than most -- especially for the price .	1
My portable XM radio was over driving the amp in my truck no matter how I adjusted it . Installed this product in line with the radio output and problem solved and for almost nothing .	1
Well this product has absolutely exceeded my expectations in terms of the overall sound quality .. . And for the price that its offered . . .i can recommend any one to just buy it .. without thinking twice . ..Cons : Not as comfortable as over the ear headphones . ..	1
I purchased these headphones looking for a set of sub-100 dollar on-ear phones . Like many other reviews say , the sound quality is superb for the price range . my only complaint is the comfort . i do n't wear them on a daily basis , and they are slightly difficult to get accustomed to . other than that , this is a top notch product .	1
These headphones are really great , unfortunately mine broke early on . The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $ 9.00 shipping and handling . I stood up and literally tore the cables out . In my own defense , they 're not secured in tightly . I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they 're stylish and the sound is really great . They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation ; and , they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels .	1
I bought the Sennheiser PX200 and returned them since they hurt my head ( 7 3/4 hat size ) . These headphones sound better , ( better range and low end ) , fit better , and cover more of my ears . Solid value .	1
Most anywhere on the web you can find these for between $ 30 to $ 40 bucks and they are well worth it . I tend to be a bit of an audio snob but I 'm using these on a cell phone and occasionally an Ipod . So I understand those are n't going to be able to push a lot of power in order to get a full range.Even with that being the case I was pleasently surprised with the efficiency of these . You do n't have to turn them up very loud to get a full sound . Bass is very strong , it can be a little too strong at times depending on your musical taste . I listen to a wide range , from classical , to Hip-Hop and for things like Jazz and Classical I find that these struggle a little because the sound separation is okay , the highs are a little on the flat side and the bass can be a little imbalanced . This is n't to say they sound bad but for music demands with a high range then these are n't going to do as good as they would for something like Mos-Def for whom these are exceptional . The construction is pretty good though the design is very dated but I can live with that because I 'm concerned about the sound it produces not how cute they are.If good sound is what your looking for at a great price just listen one time and you 'll understand why they 're considered classics . For a $ 30 price you can get $ 100 sound .	1
Work well and easy to use . The cord is to short , but the sound , build quality , and weight are are outstanding . These headphones excel in these most important areas . I will constantly pick them over a more expensive heavy set .	1
I 've had these for a while , have n't used them much and then have begun to do so with library books on CD . Okay to good sound , but the durability is n't great -- - one of the ear pieces constantly comes off . It can be re-placed , but it 's a nuisance .	1
These are by far the best sounding portable headphone I 've ever heard . They are very efficient and play louder than most small headphones of this type . The sound on the low end defies their small size and they have plenty of great sound at the top too . As far as style goes I 've heard a lot of people complain that they are out of date looking . I 'm not quite sure what the problem is . Just about any headphones of this type are going to be a band with two round speakers , not much you can do in the way of `` style '' . If you would prefer the band to go behind your head you can try the SportaPro . For the money these are hard to beat . The sound is so good they make a good choice for everyday listening as well as activities where portability is needed .	1
Great sound , time proven stats and abilities . Check out reviews elsewhere , I did , these are the best quality for the price .	1
I 've heard nothing but good things about these and I finally decided to try them . The verdict ? Not bad at all ( for the price ) but I 'm not sure they deserve such high praise.Pros ... .1 . Obviously , they 're very affordable and they sound pretty good2 . Compact and very portableCons ... 1 . Sound can be a bit muffled at times . Sometimes there 's a bit too much bass . This is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you 're listening for it at all.2 . The touted feature that 's supposed to make them more comfortable does n't seem to do much at all for me.3 . The cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours.I 'd buy them again if I had a tight budget and needed a set of compact , portable headphones . But I 'd think about stepping up to something a bit better sounding if I could spend more .	1
I bought these headphones based on suggestions and reviews I 'd read on the internet . I wanted something with decent sound and comfort that would n't break the bank ; I will be traveling abroad for a semester , and needed something with which to enjoy my music without the comfort of my micro stereo . I was n't sure what to expect as I 'm not much of an audiophile , but I was very pleased with the PortaPros . They are very comfortable , provide ample bass and overall sound quality , and fold up to make them quite portable to boot ( go figure ) . The included case and 1/4 '' audio adapter were nice bonuses . I am using them with an iPod and my laptop , both sound even better than my stereo with the PortaPros . Only thing I dislike is that the hook to keep them latched together in `` travel mode '' does n't hold all that well.If you buy them , consider getting some of the foam ear pad replacements to go with ( Koss PORTABLE Replacement Cushions ) . The headphones will last , but the pads might eventually tear ( they did on my old Sony headphones ) .	1
I 've purchased 3 sets of these over the years for my son and his mother . 2 of the 3 are still going strong . My son has managed to destroy a pair of these and bunches of others but I digress . In every way possible these are great headphones . Portable , easy to use , sufficient bass , and fairly priced to boot . If I used an MP-3 player of any kind I 'd have a pair of these . Since I 'm more a full-range stereo kinda guy , my big boy Sennheisers fill my bill . I have used these headphones on occaision however and ca n't recommend them more highly.Da Worfster	1
I have been wanting a great set of headphones for years and finally took the time to research them and checked with C-net before I purchased anything . I am so glad that I got these , they are so very comfortable ( even with brand new ear piercings ) and sound incredible . I am also very happy to find out they have a lifetime warranty .	1
Fit only so-so , pressure adjustment flimsy . Sound quality very good but not outstanding ; sound leaks very noticeable .	1
I bought a pair for my family computer 5 years ago . Aside from replacing the ear pads once in the 5 years - they have sounded phenomenal and have provided years of good and satisfying use ! The independent reviews speak for themselves . Allow me to put it this way : Koss does not make many models of headphones , have been pulled out of bankruptcy in the 80 's because of these headphones , and have not changed the design since their introduction in 1984 . With that said , these headphones keep the company profitable - so let that be a testament of how good they are . Furthermore , companies do not change their designs if they struck gold - look at the German car makers and American muscle . They have not changed , have the same accents , and characteristics because you do n't fix things that are not broken.Sound Quality : I bought AKG Q460s and they were horrible for the price . I had to sell those nightmares off to buy these . It served me right for considering anything but Koss . After hearing such bad headphones I missed the PPs because I am currently away . I needed these to remind me of home . These sound very well balanced , have great bass , and crisp mids , and lighter treble . I think that bass heads will not like these , but will nonetheless appreciate the sound quality and accuracy of these fairly neutral headphones . They do let in/out sound as they are padded and open air , but they are good for quieter environments and very comfortable . The open airs are better because the diaphragm vibrates freely which makes the bass sound less punchy and boxy . These are also very warm headphones with a presence of mids.Pros : Great sound and lifetime warranty.Cons : They are a little awkward because of the metal band , but you will get over it when you hear how good they are.If you are buying online and do n't have the time to test them . Just buy these . It 's a no brainer . These are the most liked and most reviewed headphones for a reason . If reviews do n't convince you - I do n't know what will !	1
You really ca n't beat the sound of the headphones for the price . They fit really well , sound amazing , look sweet and rival higher end headphones . I am going to pick up a set for work and home . Even though they are portable , I still forget them . : )	1
I purchased these after reading many reviews and was not disappointed . They do not have the best high range , but decent . Great mid range and surprisingly good low end for the size and style . They performed so well , that my 16 year old nephew ended up confiscating them as his . When I called him out on the retro style , he shrugged and said & # 34 ; have you heard these ? & # 34 ; Enough said !	1
I am very pleased with these headphones . They produce great sound , are light weight and adjustable , and fold to a very compact size.My only complaint is that they came with an adapter for a large input jack ( which is very rarely found ) instead of an adapter for two prong jacks ( which are required for using these headphones on an airplane ) . I could n't even find an adapter at Radio Shack so ended up listening to the audio on the airplane in one ear only . Oh well , otherwise they 're great .	1
Sure , these headphones are n't exactly comparable to top of the line Sennheisers or other expensive head phones but for the reasonable price I got just what I wanted , a lightweight bass prone pair of head phones that with the right eq on my Ipod actually sounds very good . I carry these with me for my travels where they serve as movie and music headphones and they do a great job . Would I want to take a more audiophile approach I would turn to a pair of HD 598 's or similar , but these do just what they 're supposed to do.Really like 'em !	1
No longer use wired headphones as I have totally switched over to blue tooth headphones . I could n't deal with the messy wires . They worked well but they are in the pile of stuff for my local church to sell .	1
These headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar . For a sub $ 40 price , you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price . But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $ 200.The bass , which was great by 80s standards , ca n't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones . Otherwise , there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive . I did hear many sounds ( mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music ) which I could n't hear with my inferior iPod headphones . But again , the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior , then this headphone is great . Unless you want to look retro 80s , however , you may want to wear them inside .	1
Really nice pair of low cost ear phones that do a very decent job . If youu do'nt want to spend a lot of money you get your monies worth with this set .	1
Pros : Compact , light weight , lifetime warranty , great sound for size/price . Moving around much ? They have a tight grip on your head . Durable , I once stepped on them causing one of the ear pieces to pop off and I simply clicked it back into place like nothing happened . Short cord for people who do n't wander 20 feet away from their audio player ( laptop , mp3 player ) like some other headphones have.Cons : I 've heard people say how comfy they are , but my hat size of 7 1/2 says very different . After a few hours they simply prove to tight and give me a headache . And that 's whether I have sound running through them or not . On occasion a hair might get caught in the metal band but not enough of a problem to warrant not getting them.I use these for my laptop and iPod and they do an excellent job with music and gaming . Base is kinda bad but for the size and cost it does more then enough . Mine have the straight plug which is really annoying as I like the 90 deg ones much better but it works regardless . I 'd recommend these to other people . The only drawback I can find is they can give me a headache of using them for a couple hours . Maybe if you have a smaller head you 'll be ok ? They can seem flimsy , but I 've had them for 2 years and have traveled with them so I could n't justify and claims of them being `` cheap '' headphones . And with a lifetime warranty I say go to town . I do n't use the case at all either , used to , but I deemed it to much of a hassle and lost it somewhere . No regrets on that.I would give the product 5 stars but the headache thing really detracts from them . I still like and use my pair and if you want some cheap good headphones I 'd go with these again any day of the week . ( Maybe not Tuesday )	1
I 've had the Koss PortaPro 's for about four months now and I decided it was time to give them the review they deserved.I mainly used standard Sony studio monitor headphones for personal music listening when I 'm on my desktop computer or laptop , and I would use earbuds with my iPod on the go or in bed at night . I decided I wanted to try these headphones considering the golden reviews they 've been getting.When I received them they were a lot smaller than I thought they would be , but they fit my head perfectly and they are very comfortable . I ca n't even feel them after a while . They do require a little adjusting after some time but my ears do n't feel sore after long listening sessions.They sound great and they look great , too . Some people might think they look too wild/retro/geeky , but that 's what I like about them -- they are unique in their design . They do n't look bad to me at all.They have an extremely clean and crystal clear sound . The highs are crisp , the mids are warm , full , and natural , and the lows are tight , deep , and full-sounding . They do have a little bit of extra bass , but that 's no problem for me . I can just turn off the EQ on my computer audio player and they sound perfect . I always have the EQ off on my iPod so they sound just fine there , too . The extra bass really is n't that bad at all . It should n't affect your buying choice with these headphones.Yes , they are flimsy and you have to be somewhat gentle with them , but they are surprisingly durable . I 've fallen asleep at night with these headphones on and when I wake up finding them near my pillow off my head , I 'm worried they had been destroyed . To my surprise , I find no bends or any signs of stress on them . The ear pieces do n't even fall off either , and those are held on with just a little plastic clip it looks like . ( They pivot to fit the shape and position of your ears . ) The only cons I have about these headphones is the somewhat short cable length . It 's 4ft . long , but I sometimes find myself accidently yanking on them with my arms when I 'm not careful . That 's fine though , as I just use another 4ft . extension cable I found . I also have to adjust the headband to almost it 's widest when I put them on . I wish there was some type of locking mechanism on the headband.These have become my standard headphones for at-home and on-the-go listening . Overall , these are great headphones and I will definitely choose these for the rest of my life , or until they stop making them .	1
Porta pros have been around for decades in various models and there 's a reason they 've been so successful . It 's because they sound so good ! I 've had several versions of these since the late 70s , and never been disappointed . Get some , you 'll be glad you did .	1
very good headphones , especially for the cost . The sound is not really accurate , its more muddled in the mids and lows . But for some reason , this just makes them sound awesome , like some vintage amp playing an old school record . I definitely recommend these .	1
I agree with all the positive reviews about these amazing stereophones . They sound phenomenal for the price . The only negative is the weakness of the cords . After a year or two of normal use , one side or the other may break its connection and there 's no way you can fix it yourself ( many tiny strands to solder ) . I have returned mine twice to Koss ( great lifetime warranty ) and they have replaced them for a small $ 6 shipping charge . It takes about 3-4 weeks . That 's my only complaint .	1
I 've had these for a few months now and I 'm very satisfied . Great sound quality , very comfortable , and very durable compared to the plethora of plastic dominating the market . So 5 stars from me !	1
I was on the verge of buying Bose headphones but the price bothered me . I read at least 50 reviews from different sources and decided to buy Koss plus my picky sister said they were good . I 'm pleased , they sound great and the price is right .	1
I had a friend order this for me a while back from a site and I must say they 're still working great . Excellent , audiophile-quality headphones for a decent price . So far , they 've held up incredibly well over the year or so I 've had them . They 're very light and they have n't fallen apart or cracked anywhere at all , but still glad to have the KOSS warranty to replace them if I need to . The carrying case is a bit small so do watch out for that , but they will fit with a bit of finagling . I am a 19 year old college student , so I 'm on the go a lot . I keep them in my laptop bag and they fit right in . If I decide I want to be a tool and wear them around my neck , they 're nice because they automatically adjust to their smallest headband size , so they fit around the neck more like a choker necklace . I also love getting looks from people . Some comments include : '' I like your headphones . `` `` Those are some wacky ass headphones man . `` `` Those are nice how much did they cost . `` `` They sound amazing . `` et cetera.Pros : -I personally love the 80 's styling.-Fold really small and are very portable . ( Duh ) -Come with a carrying case that feels very high quality and protects them from me.-The ear cushions themselves do not feel like the cheap foam that I was expecting , they 're actually closer to Tempurpedic mattress foam , but a bit less squishy.-They ( used to ) automatically adjust to your head size without even having to touch them . I 'll explain below.-Of course , the best thing , they sound great.Cons : -They fold small , but not flat . The headphones are still as thick , when folded , as the diameter of the ear pieces and such . I really wish they folded flat , that would make these truly great.-They do n't FEEL all that well made . ( But have held up thus far ) -Over the course of the year or so I 've had them , the metal headband part has bent slightly , but I imagine it 's from the times I 've tried to fold them up too small , so be aware of that , I 'll explain below.-They will make your ears ache after a while ( an hour or so ) .Meh : -I do n't like how small the carrying case is , if it was n't so well made , I 'd think I was going to rip the seams or something when putting my 'phones away . Actually , it 's not the case itself that 's too small , as I can fit my MP3 player in the bag as well , but the opening . It does n't open very wide . Be careful not to snag anything when putting them away.-Price is pretty cheap , but not exceptional , but I ca n't complain.-They do n't noise cancel , but they 're not noise cancelling headphones . I put this here because it 's both good and bad . I like hearing my music in peace , but I also like being able to talk to my friends without having to remove my left earpiece from my ear . So they 're okay for that.-They have a comfort setting on the sides , it 's a switch you have to work . No , it is not an electronic switch for `` bass boost '' or anything like that , so do n't get all excited . It 's a mechanical switch that basically pushes the pieces against your head tighter . If you have it on the light setting and you move/fold the 'phones inward though , it 'll automatically jump to the firm setting I think . It 's kinda gimmicky , but it does adjust the tension SLIGHTLY . This will not prevent them from hurting your ears after a long period.So , as you can see , my cons and such are mostly about certain `` bonus '' features of the headphones . As a pair of headphones , they 're the best I 've ever had.Okay , so as I wrote above , there are two things I have to elaborate on : -Self adjustment : When I first bought these headphones , I could hold one side with one hand and simply lower them onto my head , and they would self adjust like some piece of alien technology . Neat . Well , it 's been a while and , while I do my best to take care of my technology , all the folding/unfolding of them , due to the nature of the design , has bent the headband slightly out of the almost-perfect circle it used to be in . It does NOT look any different aesthetically , but it inhibits the little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes from doing their job as well as they did originally . And by `` little self-adjusting magical fairy gnomes , '' I mean `` those black things on the metal headband that guide it through . '' Anyhow , not a huge deal , as it 's still very easy to adjust.-Folding the headphones : As I 've said above , the constant folding/unfolding of the headphones will ( if you 're not careful and you accidentally and repeatedly fold them up too tight without knowing ) bend the metal headband to the point where it wo n't self-adjust as easily as it originally did . So , I 'm going to help you figure out how to fold them , so you can avoid bending your pair on accident . Okay , so , it 's pretty easy to do . The large plastic black pieces that hold the headphones fold inward . Fold them as if you were pushing them into your ears . They will swing into the center of the arc of the headphones about the little piece with the oval-shaped head cushions . Now , on each side of the hinge area , there is a loop and a hook . I do n't remember which side is which , but you 'll see it . It 's the end of the metal headband . Hook the ends into the ends , and you 'll have a nice neat circle . Now , you can move the little black slider pieces toward where you just hooked the headband to itself , but DO NOT GO TOO TIGHT . This is how you will bend them . I would say you can slide them about an inch and a half away from the hinge where the earpieces fold in . Now you should be good to go and they 'll stay nice and folded.Anyhow , that 's about all I have to say . These are well worth the money . I do n't use them at home , because I have larger , more comfy headphones for that , but if I 'm out ? This is all I use . I generally hate earbuds , I always have , so this is how I listen to my music if I go out anywhere .	1
The first thing I will say is that when I got these headphones they were a lot smaller than I envisioned . The retro look reminded me of some old headphones I had that were much larger . I suppose that is my fault though since they are sold as portables.Pros : The sound quality is great for portables . They sound even better than some of the lower-end , ear-covering studio headphones that I have . I have always liked Koss ' attention bass response in their headphones . The cord is just the right length for portable headphones at about 3 feet . Do n't get these if you like longer cords . They fold up very nicely and compact . It comes with a carrying case and 1/8 to 1/4 adapter . They are pretty light and comfortable , though a little tighter on wider heads.Cons : They feel somewhat cheap and I imagine the actual hinge piece on the speaker driver snapping off over time ( the speakers are on a two way hinge for comfortable fit ) . My head is on the larger side ( while not huge ) and I find these headphones the most comfortable on their largest setting . They do n't seem to cater well to larger heads . I wish they had some kind of padding on the top of the headband.These are really good portable headphones with great sound quality , as long as your head is n't huge .	1
I listened with portapro in J & R ; 9 years ago , and I was pretty surprised for the sound , and bought itsince then , I fell in love with portapro family series ( PortaPro , SportaPro , KTX Pro ) they all sound excellent , full bass with its power , clean human voice and crisp treble , and they 're all well-balancedthey 're pretty good headphones for portable ( portable CD/MD players , mp3 players , pdas , laptops , even radios ) I often suggest other customers to buy portapro , and let them hear themselves , and they 're happy with the soundthe only weakness is : the cable , it breaks easilyfor KTX Pro users , you can order PortaPro earpads to get same great sound as PortaPro	1
Great highs , mids and lows , for a $ 35.00 headphone you can not go wrong ... period . I have the Sennheiser px100 and may like these even more . More life and dynamics .	1
I really ca n't add more than others have written . Yes , I got my hair snagged the first couple times . Once I figured how to take em on and off it 's been no big deal.The sound quality is fantastic . Bass is present in spades . Highs are well defined and have n't gotten tinny on me . I 'm not a fan of too much mid range and these give me all the highs and lows I want . Comfy too . To the point I despise putting buds on when I workout . May get a 2nd pair just for working out . This is one product where the reviews on Amazon are dead on.Ca n't recommend these highly enough .	1
I got a pair of sportapros , KSC75s and these to see how the sound is in each of them when they are supposed to have the same driver . And to be fair , I was confused . Each headset has it 's own distinct feature and advantage . Very frankly speaking , the portapro 's price is what I believe Koss cashing in on the hype , since frankly speaking I do not see the 50 % increase in any way.That being said , the portapros do sound the best of the lot , because it feels like it has a slightly wider soundstage . I guess that is since the sportapros have a solid plastic plate almost covering the speakers , hence kind of `` closing '' it up a bit . The KSC75 have it in them to sound as good as these two , but the lack of any pressure to hold the speakers closer to the ear result in most of the sound leaking out , hence the huge drop in bass . Press the speakers close to the ears with your hand and you 'll get what I mean.Comfortwise , I would say the KSC75s win by a mile . You wo n't even feel that you have a pair of earphones on . The pads are good , comfy , and the same for all the three , but here the lack of pressure on the ears plays to the advantage of the KSC75s.Sportapros definitely look odd . The KSC75s look uglier . Love the design idea of the sportapro though , the conversion to a behind-the-head fit is genius , and definitely a worthy option given the metal band of both sportapro and portapro being always hungry for the hair follicles around it . The portas and the sportas both come with a nice faux leather pouch , in which you can curl both of them in to a cute little ball and toss in . the sportas came with a nice gold plated 3.5cm to 1/4 '' adapter as well . Packaging wise , portapro is miles aahead of the rest ( well they are almost twice as expensive as the sportapros ! ! ) . The KSC75s do not have any bells and whistles in the pack , but then again it 's almost 1/3rd the price of portas.The only concern in any of the three headphones was the adapter of the KSC75s , which do not have any protective ridging for the wires coming out of it , make me skeptical about the longevity of the connection.The KSC75s are the best bang for the buck definitely . But again , even the most expensive PortaPro is less than half the price of it 's closest competitor from another company.But seriously kudos to Koss for making some of the best headphones I 've heard in my life and at prices the others can only go green on .	1
Surprising good sound for the money . These things sound too good to be used for workouts . They have foam earpads and those thing will get nasty with sweat . I use these at work and I could n't be happier with them .	1
Let me start off by saying I have owned these for many months and have enjoyed them thoroughly . The sound quality is amazing , clear voice , nice bass and not too much that it is overpowering . To the people saying they feel cheaply made , mine went through an hour in the washer and then into the dryer and are still working as well as they did on day one . They are fairly comfortable for what they are , they fit great under a hoodie , there is an adjustment to set it to your comfort level . I highly recommend .	1
The Koss PortaPro are great set of headphones for the ipod classic . I read other people reviews and majority of them being very positive so I gave them a try . Wow , the sound that comes from these headphones are great ( no static/noise ) . The fit of these is very comfortable and adjustable to any size . I thought the metal would bother me ( I shave my head ) but no problem here I do not feel them . If you are looking for a great set of headphone that will not break the bank and sound great look not further .	1
YOU HAVE TO HERE THESE TO BELIEVE IT . I WENT TO A BIG ELECTRONICS PLACE WHERE I LIVE AND THEY HAVE ALOT OF HEADPHONES ON DISPLAY AND I MEAN ALOT , I BROUGHT A CD PLAYER IN WITH ME AND THE KOSS HEADPHONES TO COMPARE , I TRIED SOME THAT WERE $ 100 OR MORE AND THEY DID NOT SOUND AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN THESE . AND WHEN THE FOAM PADDING WEARS OUT , YOU CAN REPLACE THEM , WHICH YOU CAN NOT ON THE EXPENSIVE ONES , YOU CAN GET THE FOAM PADS THROUGH AMAZON ALSO	1
Sound of Koss portapros is truly remarkable . Great sound for any price ! My one complaint is that they are a little heavy and not quite as comfortable as I would like . Works best when clips on side of each headphone are pushed back for loosest fit . Also , wish the headphones were a little more portable . They do n't really fold up as small as I would like . Lest I sound like too great a critic , I would purchase them again . In fact , I sent my son-in-law a pair for Christmas .	1
Excellent sound for the money . I only got to use them for a short time and wife discovered them . She loves them and wo n't give them back .	1
These headphones are great ! I 've been using them around town for about two weeks . They sound really good . The bass is n't overly punchy or overwhelming but sounds really nice . The whole sound is very clear through the Linkin Park , Incubus , Pendulum , Bonobo , and some other tracks that I 've listened to with these headphones.My only complaint is that they feel a bit flimsy and I try to be really careful with them . So far , I 've dropped them once and they 're fine .	1
Not even sure writing a review can do these headphones justice , exceptional ; is the first word that comes to mind . These are not just good for the price , they are just good . There is always a satisfying feeling I get when I feel like I received more than I payed for , and that is exactly what I received here . Very highly recommended .	1
I ordered these for an upcoming cruise to use on the plane and the ship both . Have tried them out on my laptop and for their size they sound great . Not as nice as the noise cancelling ones that I keep at my desk at work but then again their not as big and bulky as those either .	1
Fro the price these are hard to beat . I love the retro look and the sound quality will far surpass anything at this price point . Lifetime warranty as well .	1
We 've had these headphones for about 8 years until the kids finally finished them off when trying them.These headphones are great for using in gym . They designed in the way that the pressure is distributed between your ears and your scull so that they are fixed firmly when you 're jogging.The sound quality is simply amazing for their price . The design looks sort of dated but that 's because they 've been produced without change for more then 25 years now.I 've bought the same model now to replace the broken once.Highly recommend .	1
I have been using these for about a month now . I have done some traveling , working out , and simple listening at work with the Porta Pros and I love them so far . The bass is great , the sound quality is wonderful for a tiny portable set of headphones , and they are comfortable on my ears.I would definitely buy another pair .	1
I 've owned these for 5 years and they still sound great . Lifetime warranty , crisp sound , good base for portables , sturdy , comfortable . Get them .	1
I 've had two pair of these . Lost the first pair and replaced them . Light weight and great sounding and easy to store with a life time replacement warranty . You just ca n't go wrong .	1
These headphones are an amazing value and very well designed . The headphones are small , yet the design is such that they firmly yet comfortably fit on your head . There is a small button allowing adjustment of how much pressure is exerted . The drivers are nicely padded and there are pads that sit on the temple , ensuring that the drivers sit parallel to the ears.The sound is superb , especially considering the size of the phones . The bass extension is very good and satisfying , much better than comparably sized phones . The overall sound is neutral and non-fatiguing so that you can listen to them for hours at a time without getting tired.One thing to note is that headphones typically are `` open '' or `` closed '' design . A closed design uses heavy pads to block out external noise and are meant for use in noisy environments . Open headphones , like the Koss PortaPros , are designed for use in quiet environments . So if you want phones for use in the subway or the airplane , these are not designed for that type of use.Another very important feature of Koss phones is the lifetime warranty . I have had my Koss PortaPros for over 10 years now . I have accidently snagged the wires and ripped one out . I sent them back to Koss with a check to cover the nominal shipping and handling charge ( see their website for details ) , and they promptly refurbished my headphones , and even put on new pads to replace my old pads ! Other manufaturers would have forced me to buy a new pair of phones . So if you expect your phones to take some punishment during use , the lifetime warranty is a big plus.Those interested in small , open style phones may also want to check out the Sennheiser PX100 , which delivers similar performance , though the PX100 has less prominent bass and more mid-range ; the typical Sennheiser sound . Both are excellent values but in my mind , the extra bass output and lifetime warranty make the Koss phones a slightly better deal .	1
I was due for a new set of headphones , and as I despise earbuds , I searched carefully , and found these superb phones from Koss . They are not expensive , yet if you are particular about your music , your ears will hear sounds other headphones could not reproduce . I can wear these all day and they are not so large you look like a relic from the 70 's . They fold closed and come with a leather-like bag . The bass is clear and not muddy , the highs are clean and not painful to the ear.This model has been in production continiously since 1984 without change ! Koss hit it right with these !	1
I agree with those who say the look is retro , but I have to say the sound is fantastic , especially for $ 30. ! I compared it to my full size Sennheiser which cost considerably more and the sound was great . When playing various styles of music you 'll find it does sound better on pop/rock/country music compared to classical music , but it was no slouch on the classical side . It really brought my laptop to life , whether it was music or a movie . I would suggest you carefully put it on to avoid pulling on your hair , but that was n't too diffucult . My son tried it and he wanted to trade the Sony 's I gave him , I told him he was out of luck !	1
This sound much better than Sennheiser PX 100 ( owned for about 2 years ) . It is comfortable on me but I just do n't like style . PX100 look better .	1
So many good reviews so I will keep it shortI have 2 models of Koss , Koss Porta-Pro ( semi-open design , bass is plenty , light and easy on you ears ) these are very comfortable and I am wearing them now : ) Koss ProDJ100 ( Closed design , a bit more detailed and more of a solid bass but not boomy ) I find I use these for gaming allot as well as Music and find them Very Clear : )	1
Great headphones . Comfortable but not especially lite weight . I would purchase again . I like the single cord . xxx xxx xxxx	1
I 'm not an audiophile but i think these sound good . Mostly good bass response and block of the surrounding sounds.I have been using mine at work every day of the week . They are just as good as the day i bought them . I have dropped them a few times but they do n't seem to care.If these ever break i will buy another pair . Good value for the price . ( Updated ) I have now had these for a few months . ( Using them right now as I type ) I use them everyday at work , I drop them regularly , and they look and work as good as the day I bought them .	1
Given their price , these are pretty decent headphones , and worth the cash.My only two problems with it - first , they need to be resized every time you put them on , because they seem to suffer from & quot ; pool shrinkage & quot ; - they shrink to the smallest size once you take them off.And second is the one brought up fairly often - they do n't do anything to block out outside noise . Which is n't that big a deal , as I did n't really need noise-blocking headphones anyway .	1
You can only be careful when you buy something that looks good but it is too cheap , and these headphones do look great , they do feel comfy , they cover my entire ear , and the sound it is awesome , so yes I took the risk and I did right , these headphones for sure deliver great sound and the best part of it the price.. I totally recommend them , just keep in mind that if you have been using expensive equipment you might find these only to be ok , if all you want is to listen music , or just watch movies with these , they are great..	1
$ 20 headphones , and they work great . I honestly believe that this is the best of what I can buy with the money . I like how durable it is .	1
I 'm writing a review on the Koss R-80 . First off I had a pair of Koss UR20 . These Koss R-80 off the bat feels the same in the material but it has a different design . The headband will stay in its adjusted form when if you take it off your head . It has a coiled cord which can be removed . The cord is connected like a phone card.Right when I put these headphones on I heard immediate sound difference . I use these on my computer through my Audiy 2zs . Very nice strong midbass and low bass . It hits the notes clean and clear . Never thought how great these would sound for the price . A very clean sound and strong bass . It 's also very light . The only thing I dont like is the shape of the earpieces . The design needs to slim the headphones down a bit . For the price this is one nice headphone that will LAST . My Koss UR20 still work after 4-5 yrs of abuse . I just needed to replace them . Get this Koss R-80 and you will be glad . Super fast Amazon free shipping also !	1
for the price you will not find a better pair . sound quality is top a+ nice fit also what more can i say	1
These are just about the best headphones you can get for ~ $ 25.The entire sound range is great . Great response , great bass , clear midrange . Gives the original Sennheiser PX-100 ( another excellent headphone ) a run for its money at less than half the price.By the way - The drivers are identical to the famous Koss PortaPro Headphones . Despite what some claim , the sound between the Sportapro and the Portapro is identical . I 've owned at least 3 pairs of each and there is no sound difference between the two . Just buy whichever is cheaper .	1
... with a name like `` SportaPro '' I assumed they 'd be pretty good for , you know , sporty things , like jogging.When in behind-the-neck position , they tend to drift a bit . You have to get the band EXACTLY right , since that 's the only thing holding them up - the band resting on your neck.Also , I 'm not saying these things need a manual , but a small piece of paper with little arrows showing which way the things can fold on the headphones will be nice . They 're a lot more adjustable than most headphones , but it 's not immediately obvious.For the price , they sound really good . Despite the drift I 've been using them for over a year and have no plans on switching .	1
They stick to my head pretty well while working out at the gym . The foam is a bit coarse , so it 's scratchy . I do n't think I could wear them all afternoon at a football game , but the bass is excellent , great motivator when doing those situps during a 90 min workout . I would buy them again .	1
For the money , these are the best headphones you can get . They have strong bass , are loud , and the sound quality is great . They are pretty sturdy , I have owned 3 pairs , and they have held up to gym use and throwing them in a backpack most of the time . The only thing I suggest is buying some extra pads , they tend to get sweaty and I like to change them out so they can dry properly . I have ripped one , but replacements are cheap . Do n't waste money on more expensive headphones , buy these and enjoy them for years to come .	1
Koss does it again- I 'll never purchase another brand 's headphones , ever . My last 5 have all been Koss and these have held up great . I also got a set of PortaPros for casual wear . Love Koss !	1
I wanted these phones because they are supposed to work as behind the head or on top of the head . Turned out that when used behind the head , they were a little uncomfortable , so I use them with the band on top . Not exactly what I expected , but they are OK and the sound is good .	1
These sound very , very good . Most `` mini '' headphones are lacking in either lows , mids or highs . These have all frequency ranges covered.At first I could not figure out how they were supposed to work in behind-the-neck mode . I tried it every which way , but they were always either awkward or loose . I could n't believe they promoted these as behind-the-neck headphones when they were so ill-fitting.But I did some googling , and discovered something that is not shown in the packaging or the enclosed manual : The headband pivots . So what you do is , put the headphones on the top of your head so that it 's comfortable ; hold the ear pieces in place on your ears ; then push the headband toward the back of your head with your index fingers.This way the ear pieces fit exactly the way they do when the headband is on top of your head , except the headband goes around the back of your head instead of the top . It 's very comfortable and they fit securely . ( They 're actually not behind-the-neck phones , they 're behind-the-head phones . ) This may be common knowledge , but I did n't see it in any of the reviews I read , though I did see complaints about how they do n't work behind the neck .	1
Strait out of the packaging I hooked them up to my HDCD Denon player . Overall , they 've got good highs and mids . The 6khz treble region could be a little more pleasantly recessed than it is , but the high-end never gets fatiguing at normal volumes - only when loud . I must say that the bass is a little exaggerated . It is noticeably overdone in the 30-80HZ region -- the lowest you can pretty much hear with headphones . This never *seems* to muddle the mids , which is often a problem with bass-heavy phones . It does n't seem excessively boomy and there are oodles of low-end dynamics , which I did not expect . They remind me a lot of the Denon 950 's , but without the Denon 's tissy-fit highs . When I hooked them up to my Panasonic 361C portable , I was surprised even further . With Curve : Doppelganger , the bass did n't seem even the slightest bit exaggerated . Unfortunately , when I moved over to extreme low-end intensive music like Massive Attack : Mezzanine , there was still a little too much bass , but slightly less than on the Denon . Econoline Crush : The Devil You Know kind of had too much bass , but most people would probably prefer it that way . Yet , on many CD 's bass is noticeably overdone . Spatially , the SportaPros have a nice open sound.The SportaPros fold up and this is where the other caveat comes out . When using the headband behind your head , the little fold-up hook can start rubbing against my head , behind my right ear . This only happens when the band slides too far down , though . All Koss had to do was have the hook facing the opposite direction to avoid this . They 're still the most comfortable headphones-that-press-on-the-ear that I 've ever tried , and I do love how they fold up ; it returns them to a nice , taught shape . The Koss has a good , short length of cord for portable use that also has a mute button on it.I 'll keep the SportaPros as a portable and bass-y alternative . If used with bass turned down a tad , they would be even better.P.S . Single-entry wires are not superior . They allow out of phase cross-talk to enter the opposite ear through the shared ground wire , which is why audiophile headphones are almost always dual-entry . The classic Sony V6 , for instance , has a cross-talk problem and is unsuitable for binaural applications because of this .	1
I have tried many other types of headphones , all more expensive , but no others come close as far as comfort and value for exercise or travel . Lifetime warranty on these also . Ca n't go wrong !	1
I purchased the Koss Sportapro headphones to use with my IPod Nano . I was surprised with the overall sound quality . The sound responsiveness is very good . The main reason I did not rate them a 5 is they are not quite as comfortable as I would like . I use them while I exercise , and I find that I have to adjust them for comfort long before I am done .	1
The SOUND : better than many portables , but a bit bassy with a corresponding loss of treble . Still not the perfect phone , especially when I am used to the full-size Sony closed-ear MDR-V6/MDR-7506 , which emphasize the treble slightly while having the full sound you get from a good headphone . My Sony 's are also more efficient -- they 're louder . PS , I wish I could find the cans that came with aiwa portable tape players a few years ago . They were great , and you could hear the cymbals dancing clearly.The LOOK : somewhat ugly plastic form.The HEADBAND : can be bent down to go behind your head to keep your gel in style . Still stays on . I liked the Sonys for this and their great look , but their sound was atrocious and they were less comfortable.The PRESSURE : the extra pads just above your ears take most of the pressure holding them on your head , so they stay on and do n't press your ears too much.The BUTTON : yes , it has a mute button on the cord , but it 's too low , at the waistband if you 're 5'-6 '' and sitting in your chair , and when you cross your arms the music cuts out.The PLUG : has a quick-connect regular and mini combo plug.The BAG : You get a leatherette bag to put them in.The SIZE : They close up flat into a 6 '' x 4 '' area for storage .	1
If you are looking for some eye candy with your music or audio , then I recommend this EQ/Meter . It is really alot of fun to watch your music and/or movies come to life . It is definitely a conversation starter.That said , the audio input and output to analog only . Therefore if you have digital audio , you need to get a converter.Overall , a fun purchase if you are looking for a light show .	1
I just received my unit - purchased directly from the manufacturer at a better price than Amazon . I was a bit apprehensive based on all the reviews that I 've read on Amazon but I also did n't want to spend a whole lot of money on my Pioneer stereo ( circa 1985 ) .It was easy to setup and connected my CD and turntable within minutes . I was puzzled the lack of sound from my turn table but thankfully I had an turn table amp that I purchased from Amazon ( see that review ) a few years back , connected it and records play wonderfully.I do not have issues that others have reported , like I said , it sounds great and it was easy to setup . I would say this is a great buy .	1
yep , it 's big and heavy . but this is the camera i keep coming back to after having it 6 years ... i have owned an HP and a Casio . the HP stunk and the Casio is a tiny delight . but the Sony was my first.it simply works . well . simply . competently . not every computer around has card slots and having a camera that uses floppy disks has been helpful.it is especially good for pictures for eBay and email . good quality photos with a small file size.so , if you see a good looking , working specimen go ahead and buy it and give digital photography a try !	1
I have had such a great time learning to use this camera and taking photos . I used it immediately , switching the dial to automatic and letting it do everything . It was exactly like a point and shoot . But when I learned how to adjust aperture and shutter speed , I took even better photos . I highly recommend this camera . I took it to Alaska in August and people said how beautiful and crisp my photos were . If you have the money , also invest in a telefoto lens . Sometimes 80mm just is n't long enough . But you can always add that later .	1
I 've been using Nikons for over 20 years , starting with my first used and battered Ftn . Over that time I 've a accumulated a dozen Nikkor lenses and numerous accessories , as well as an assortment of bodies.One thing that 's been missing in recent years from the Nikon line is a reasonably priced entry-level manual camera . The cheaper Nikons have tended to be fully automated cameras , and the cheapest manual Nikon still being made was , until recently , the FM2 at well over $ 500.If you work the way I do , you need a manual camera and do n't have a lot of use for automation and autofocusing . If you own an old Nikon and some old Nikkor lenses , you may want a simple manual camera body that can accomodate them . If you 're a student starting out , or an artist on a budget , you need a manual camera.If you fit into any of these categories , the FM10 is a great choice . It may not be as rugged as a $ 1200 F3 or a $ 2500 F5 , but it 's well made and should last many years . I 'm not a fan of zoom lenses for my own work , but the included 35-70 is a good quality lens with a useful range , and you can add more lenses if you need them.All in all , a good value and a long-needed inexpensive entry into the Nikon system .	1
The most common application for this type of memory card is a digital camera , but these can also be used with a number of electronic devices , including the HP Jordana , and even your laptop computer with a PC Card adapter . You can store any type of data on the cartridge , and they can be quickly changed between devices . I have never had a problem with any of my SanDisk Compact Flash Cards .	1
At 1024 x 768 resolution , this memory card holds 200-390 images on my Polaroid PDC-700 camera ( that 's like 8-16 rolls of film ) . The price and capacity are just right for weekend trips or special events . **Go crazy** and take pictures of anything and everything that catches your eye ! I took 89 pictures in 5 hours at my company 's & quot ; Relay for Life & quot ; event on Friday , and really enjoyed not having to & quot ; budget & quot ; my photos or worry about running out of film . The image quality was excellent , and downloading was quick & amp ; easy with a digital film reader.I 'm planning a 2-week trip to Spain this fall , and am considering an additional 32MB SanDisk memory card just in case I get **Too Crazy** . Does anyone know if they make a storage case for spare memory cards ?	1
I have the MDR-150 's and these have the exact same sound quality . I have bought several different brands in various price ranges ( all the way up to $ 100 ) , and these are the best bang for the buck . I do n't intend to use the built in volume control so hopefully the sound does n't go out like some of the other reviewers have experienced . The only problem with these Sony 's is that fake leather they put on the ear muffs.. it rubs off eventually and it will stick to your ears . Would buy these again if they last a few years .	1
These headphones are great at this price ! I already have the previous model MDR-V150 which are without the volume control and I wanted one more pair for recording vocals so that the performers can individually set the volume . My only complaint is that there 's a certain fatigue after wearing them for more than 4 hours ! Overall , the sound is great and very well balanced !	1
I 've had these headphones for about 2 years and are great for the average casual music listener.COMFORT : I primarily use them at work , and finally found these that are comfortable enough to wear for long periods of time . They are a nice mid-sized , not too big not too small , ear cup . They are not over ear cups , the padding will rest on your ears ... but they are good enough to not be uncomfortable after hours of listening . The band is sturdy and the size does not squeeze on my head.STYLE : Nice and not overly bulky like the over-ear headphones . The ear cups swing in and up for portability , but they dont fold flat . The cord is VERY long . I usually keep mine bundled up with a rubber band so it 's not all over my workspace.SOUND : These are no BOSE , but given that and the low cost ... the sound is actually very good . Bass is respectable but not earth-shattering . Mids and highs are clear and seem to sound pretty good from my novice perspective . I listen to all sorts of music and have n't noticed any distortion at any range and only sometimes wished for a little more bass .	1
You will be very pleased with the quality of the sound from these headphones . Good cord length to . Priced right .	1
Anyone looking to purchase these headphones should note : they were designed and advertised for DJ use specifically . And by DJ , I mean the live-performance variety , not the studio-technician variety.And , for DJs , these headphones are excellent.The actual physical configuration of the headphones is clearly designed for DJ use , with easily folding , individually rotating cups for single-side monitoring . They are also designed to rest close to the ear which , although it may make your ears hot and uncomfortable if you use them for prolonged home listening , is ideal for DJs because they effectively cancel noise up to extremely high volumes ( I 've used these in both a small party and club setting , and have found the non-electronic cancellation to be more than adequate for both ) .The actual sound styling is typical of Sony , with the quality generally reflecting the price . I listen to a variety of music through these : in addition to hip hop & amp ; house for club use , i listen to various other electronica , various rock , lots of acoustic music and a ton of a capella . The headphones perform admirably in all cases . The bass is strong without being overbearing , the mids are balanced and the highs are clear without being ringy or piercing.Please note my initial admonition again , however : these headphones are designed for DJs . For your money , you can probably find a better set for home use by Sennheiser , or similar , which are n't geared torward performance/studio use . In addition , other reviewers are right : the headphones get uncomfortable after prolonged use ( I found that after about 30 minutes to an hour of home use , I felt the need to take them off and massage my ears for a bit , as these fit tight and are a bit heavy ) . The only reason I would ever recommend against these for DJs is if you plan on spinning for an extraordinarily extended period of time , because they are slightly heavier than the v600s and the extra weight , while usually unnoticable , can become an issue if you 're spinning upwards of five or six hours .	1
I 'm an International DJ doing Trance , Rave , D & B , Ambient , and Dubstep . I 've owned these headphones for 8 years and they truly NEVER fail me . No matter how hard the bass drop , No matter how long a Trance chorus , They 've never popped a speaker and never quit . If you 're a REAL DJ and you need a headphone that will last you past a decade then get a pair of these . Armin Van Buuren does n't use them for no reason , and other Professional DJ 's know where its at ; Sony MDR-V700 's .	1
I bought these headphones for there great specs which they live up to . I listen primarily to classical music , but these are good for Rock and Pop as well . The bass is big , deep , and roomy . Your amplifier does n't need much power to drive these and you can drive them to deafening loudness levels with no distortion . Even with the remarkable bass there is excellent imaging in the midrange and treble . The bass does n't overpower the rest of the frequency range . Right now I am on the fence as which I would recommend : these Sony 700 's or the Sony 7506 's . The 7506 's just seem a tad more accurate . If you are into Rock or Pop more and like beefier bass then I would opt for the 700 's . I have no long term use with either . So I will defer to others as far as long term durability .	1
These are fantastic . I 'm a DJ , but now find myself toting these around everywhere because I just do n't want to listen to my music without them . My fiance is not a DJ , but steals these from me all the time.- They can take way more volume than you can likely handle without distortion.- They are sturdy , have a coily cord that 's only connected at the left ear , and fold neatly into a little bad ( included ) .- They totally block out outside noise . At a gig , you ca n't hear what you 're pumping over the speakers if you do n't want to . At a coffee shop , no one can tell your music is outrageously loud.- Intense rich bass . Even when you really crank the volume , it 's like the bass vibrates your head , instead of blasting your eardrums.A really neat little trick with these is to put them on full volume , and hold the ear cups together . You can barely hear a thing , but you can feel the bass thumping in your hands . When you open them , you 'll be shocked at how much volume they 're putting out.One last note , I bought the 1000 's , was disappointed , and bought these . Definitely the way to go .	1
Forget what you have read , these are the best dj headphones in the market ( I should know , i 'm a dj ) . i 've had the same pair for two years straight . i 'm guessing that the people who say they 're flimsy does n't take care of them . now for the review : they are very comfortable , they 're loud ( just the way i like it ) because of their design , you do n't hear the ambient noise at all ( love that ) . if you 're a dj , the single cup function is great . now the money maker : the bass , you just do n't hear the bass , you feel it , they actually vibrate when the bass kicks in . in my opinion , these are the best headphones EVER ! ! !	1
I have been in the entertainment industry for thirty five plus years .. Watching to pros around me use these headphones must have stuck in my head .. I just started a new business , needed headphones and the MDRV600s became the obvious choice .. They are comfortable to wear - Have a long cable and seem to reproduce a fine spectrum of natural sound .. I love these things .. I just wonder why I waited this long .. I should have had these to listen to my music a long while ago - There great !	1
Every night , I listen to a CD ( Holosync by Centerpointe ) while going to sleep . The CD has a range of frequencies , from deep bass ( down to as low as 20 Hz ) to mid-range . Also , since I travel frequently , the headphones need to be sturdy.When my previous headphones ( by Sennheiser ) died , I purchased these to use for the CD instead.From an audio quality standpoint , with my old Sennheiser headphones , I could hear some subtle nuances in the audio , at slightly lower volume , than I can with these headphones . Then again , the Sennheiser headphones cost $ 250 , while these cost $ 70.However , my Sony headphones serve me very well . They produce good ( but not great ) sound , so I can clearly hear the bass and mid-range without turning up the volume . Because the ear cups are soft and comfortable , the top is padded , and the headphones themselves are lightweight , I can easily fall sleep with the headphones on.The coiled cord is extremely handy , keeping the headphones from becoming too tangled.Beyond that , the headphones themselves are sturdy , standing up to a year of being put in a squished suitcase without a scratch . Also , they are very affordable ( about $ 70 from Amazon.com ) .The only issue is , if I wanted headphones to use while working out , these headphones would n't do because the padding would likely absorb my sweat . However , for my non-workout needs , these are excellent.Although the audio is n't quite professional quality , these are an excellent set of headphones for the money .	1
These are the official headphones for the Holosync user . I have used them with some of the new audio 3-d sound that the higher levels of HOLOSYNC use and they were amazing . The `` knock '' at the door and the `` whisper '' in one ear , on the demo CD , for the sound technology , I think it is called `` AudioPhonics '' made me jump thru the roof - the sound was SO REAL ! I think these headphones are very comfortable - they have the adapters - both small and large - that come with them , you do n't have to buy separate ones , and the cord is long , flexible and coiled . I thought Amazon had a VERY decent price for them , I 've seen them at 2x or 3x the price . No complaints at all - I really like them a lot .	1
I have used a pair of MDR-V600 headphones to fine-tune critical mixes and do any and all other client audio work for ( I think ) over a decade . I have replaced the ear cushions once , which was surprisingly easy to do . I can not imagine what reviewers are thinking of when they describe the sound as muddy -- these have served me well as a reference standard for all the work I do . I have tried several other pairs of high-end cans and I keep coming back to these . I think I paid twice what you can find them for now , back in the day ( I seem to remember a $ 125 price tag ) , and seriously contemplate , every few months , shelving a second pair for safekeeping .	1
I use these for dj'ing , and have run them for several years . The only thing that I had happen , is the thin covering over the earphones , and also on the headband will deteriorate and come off in little pieces . I finally took some duct tape and used it like a lint roller to pull the remaining covering off because I would come home with little black pieces of material all over my head and clothes . Since I use them in loud environments , I ca n't really comment on sound quality . They do block some sound ( a little less now that the covering came off ) , which helps in loud areas . The cord is coiled , and long , it has stretched out over time , so it 's really long now , just make sure you do n't wrap the cord around the phones tightly .	1
Best Sony product I have purchased lately . My 7 year old has Autism and we bought this for one of his CD sessions . It was recommended by the therapist group and they are very responsive with sound and fit my son just fine , drowning out distracting sounds around him while he is listening to his CDs . I want to get a pair myself !	1
I first discovered these headphones by using the industrial version , the MDR-7506 , for more than 10 years as a professional field video producer . I bought the MDR-V600 's for home use , and they look and sound new after 11 years of occasional use at home.These are an over-the-ear headphone , meaning that they fit around the ears without touching them - they sit on your head but not on the ears , which means that your ears do n't get sore . This also acoustically isolates you from your environment . However , if you sweat heavily , they also tend to trap moisture.Sound reproduction is excellent and full-range , and due to the acoustic isolation of the phones , you will hear well and you wo n't hear much of what 's going on around you outside the phones . They do slightly emphasize bass in comparison to other frequencies , but that 's something that most people do n't mind.The screw-on 1/4 '' tip screws off to reveal a 1/8 '' stereo plug , so the phones work with most playback devices . I highly recommend them as durable , acoustically excellent workhorses that you will use for many years .	1
I 've had these headphones for at least 8 years . They 've been stepped on constantly , thrown around , used for countless gaming/music listening hours , and even had my dog chew on them for a bit . They still work fine.Great sound quality , reliable , durable , and so comfortable you do n't know they 're on sometimes . 5 stars .	1
I 've been a full-time telecommuter since November 2005 , so I am on headset most of the workday , all week long . If you do n't need background noise cancellation , and you prefer over-the-ear with boom microphone to stick-it-in-your-ear buds : - ) then this is a very good , reliable bet . A quick and easy mute switch / volume control is essential for conference calls , and this design is perfect for that.In November 2007 Amazon said this model was currently unavailable , so you might have to find the new model number .	1
This is the most comfortable headset I 've had & really love it . It has volume & mute controls & I can wear it for long periods without any discomfort . The only reason it does n't get 5 stars is , it just does n't last long . I think it is in part that the cord gets yanked a bit here & there , catching on something as I move about , perhaps pulling connecting wires . I 've tried other headsets that are not anywhere as good and do n't last either . I just pay for this as I need it & accept it as the way it is .	1
I 've had this gadget for a while now . It was well thought out and it works well . I 'm completely pleased . I made my decision based on the comments by Amazon reviewers . Thanks for the good advice , people !	1
I have hearing aids so I needed one that just laid on the ear . This works fine even with my iPad .	1
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition , but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset . I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings , but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset . It is clean . No scratches . No faded labeling . It looked to be brand new . Oh yeah ... it works great , too. & # 128077 ;	1
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece . The sound quality is great , and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this . The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt . The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it . Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume ( another nice feature ) or by moving the mic away from my mouth . Overall good purchase for the money .	1
I purchased this headset for use when on the cell phone . The sound quality and way it fits is excellent . The headband could be a bit sturdier but I am careful when expanding or shortening it so I think it is fine .	1
Bottom line , Plantronics makes the best headsets . I 've been very happy with this one . People say they can hear me very clearly , and it 's very comfortable to wear on long conference calls . If it breaks in the future I 'm sure I 'll buy another Plantronics headset ( this model or a comparable one ) .	1
Best headphones I have ever had . These are also the most expensive headphones I ever purchased . So , I ca n't really compare them to more expensive brands.I find that it is much easier to distinguish between different instruments and musical notes with these headphones as they provide much less blurring together of sound that other cheaper headphones I have owned.The only problem I had was that the headband started to cause the top of my head to hurt after about 1/2hr to and hour.- To fix this I just cut out a piece of memory foam from my beds mattress cover and used rubber bands to strap it to the headband.It looks ridiculous but works great .	1
I do n't remember how long I 've owned these headphones but it has to be close to 20 years . ( The only maintenance I have done is replace the foam earpads ) I have treated them with care and kept them from any type of abuse . They still look almost new and still sound exceptional . More recently I bought a pair of Sennheiser HD590 phones thinking that perhaps I would get even better quality sound . Indeed , the 590 's sound very good but frankly , though they sound slightly different than the v6 's , I do n't think they sound any better.The v6 's have a presence and clarity which is very compelling . They can thunder the bass if need be and sail through through the high treble effortlessly.The mid-tones are clear and mellow . Distortion is inaudible . If you are wanting to step up to audiophile quality headphones for a very reasonable amount of money I recommend the Sony MDR-V6 headphones .	1
Why buy more expensive headphones unless you 're into some kind of job that requires better . This head phones sound great and are very well constructed they will endure many , many years of musical pleasure . Some reviewers talk about this being a little tight on their ears and that is true but thats when they are new , what i did with mine was bent them open a little bit on the sides of the headrest and that solved the problem .	1
No question this product is full on , 5 star material . I received a pair of these phones in 1991 ( maybe 1990 , not sure ) , as a birthday present from my aunt and uncle . Since receiving them , I have taken them with me all over the world . I 've slept with them on my head on 15 hour flights , I have slept with them in my bed , they have been abused and trounced in all kinds of luggage.Not only do these things sound incredible , they obviously hold up VERY well considering the abuse I have heaped upon mine and they are STILL working and sounding perfectly after these EIGHTEEN ( 18 ) years . I am in awe of their ... awesomeness.I have replaced the ear pads once , with these Beyer Dynamic velour pads ( highly recommended btw ) : [ ... ] I 'm 36 years old , and wondering if I will be willing these things to one of my children ? ! : )	1
These headphones sound wonderful . They are a very faithful reproducer of audio , so you 're hearing what the people who made your music or moves want you to hear - not what the people who made your headphones want you to hear . I love that I can listen to dance , orchestral , rock , rap , or basically any style of music with these . The other neat thing about these headphones is that they 're standard equipment at nearly every studio ever . So you 're more than likely listening on the same headphones that the engineers who mixed down your music used.The simple fact is that these headphones blow $ 200 beats and other 'designer ' headphones out of the water . They just faithfully reproduce sound instead of slamming you with pure bass.One drawback , which might just be a personal thing : they 're too narrow for my head . I could just have a wide head , but I feel like the arms are pushing too hard against the sides of my head . I realize that this is partly necessary for good sound ( keeps the earcups seated on your ears ) but I feel like it could be toned down a bit .	1
I bought these because I was looking for a nice pair of headphones that sounded as good as the ones I remembered using as a kid when I had to listen to music through headphones while not disturbing my parents watching tv . Little did I know that Sony still makes the same model ! That 's right , some 18 years later , I now own my own pair of the exact same headphones . If the fact that Sony still makes the same headphones without any changes does n't say enough about these , then nothing I say would do much justice , but I 'll try anyway.I have a 24 '' head and despite the other reviewers who have said these headphones fit too tightly , I bought them anyway . Once I got them I did notice they are a bit tight , but since I have no plans to sit in one spot for more than a few hours with these on , this is not a concern to me . Plus , in time I expect them to loosen up a bit simply through constant use . The padding on the ears are very nice , but I can see how wearing these for hours on end might get a bit annoying , but that would probably happen with anything you put on/in your ears.Once on , I ca n't think of any other headphones I 've tried that sound as good . For my desktop speakers , I use aKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System ( Black ) that sounds amazing when playing songs through iTunes or Pandora , so I needed something better than the Apple earphones I was using when I did n't want to blast out my roommates . The MDR-V6 headphones do just that . Of course they do n't have the same punch as a floored subwoofer , but surprisingly , the bass in these headphones is quite noticeable.Until I bought these , I was n't even really using the iTunes equalizer . Now as I change music , I change the EQ because the headphones make you hear sounds you 've never heard before ! I feel like going back through all my music just to see what I 've been missing .	1
These are a great pair for the price , ~35 cheaper than the MDR7506I have just started listening to the V6s and have had the MDR7506s for a little over a year.Honestly , you get what you pay for most of the time , except for the MDR 7506 and V6 cans . They both are undeniable stars in the headphones scene.The difference between the V6 and MDR7506 is very small , but there is a difference , both in sound ( maybe my V6s just need to break in , but I generally do n't believe in the break in process for speakers ) The MDR7506 from the very beginning were absolutely amazing . Very natural sounding , great ability to pick out little details in well recorded music . I loved listening to some of the Eagle 's stuff on them , they have some crisp clean string sounds and well recorded drums . They are loose fitting on the ears somewhat , keeps your ears feeling free and comfortable . The cable is very good rubber , limber and returns to it 's shape over a few minutes if left in a knot or stretched out.The V6s have an almost equally amazing sound , more bass response than the MDR7506 . Seems that they lack ( just very so slightly ) the clarity of the MDR7506 . Earpads are more of a matt finish and firmer than the 7506s . The cable on these is no doubt quality , and will last years under normal circumstances , but the 'nice ' factor is not the same feel . The actual plug is just like that on the 7506 , same screw on 1/4 '' adapter , but the shell is nickel finished instead of black , and the contacts on the plug are nickel plated instead of gold plated . Nickel is actually preferable , against popular belief , because a majority of the jacks it will be plugged into in it 's life will have nickel plated contacts , and dissimilar metals will corrode when touching . Not really a problem in a clean , dry studio , but the ideal thing is always to be kept in mind.In the end , if you 're looking for good headphones for studio or engineering of some kind , go with the 7506 , if you 're doing an at home studio or just want bang for the buck to plug into your ipod , the V6s are where it 's at .	1
I originally bought these headphones to go with our digital piano , but my wife did n't see any need for them , so they became my computer headphones . Darn : DI want to start out by pointing out that these headphones have a very soft feel on the head , yet are firm enough to not fall off . Sound quality is extremely important to me , not just blasting bass or highs or anything . These have excellent fidelity . You can hear the highs , the lows , and the mids very clearly on this set , and one is not overpowered by the others . One thing I have noticed about lower-end headphones is the fact that when you have too many things going on in music ( or games , or movies ) some parts start to literally get lost as the headphones simply can not handle that many streams simultaneously . These headphones do not have that problem . After reading the reviews from people who have enjoyed theirs for ten to twenty years , I look forward to a long relationship with these.I listen to a wide variety of music , and everything from Linkin Park to Mozart sounds great on these headphones , as well as a wide variety of PC games ranging from thrillers where hearing clearly is essential to survival , to FPS games with explosions and gunshots . I have noticed with these phones , I feel like I have my 5.1 system on , and have to take them off to ensure I am not being obnoxious to my neighbors , only to learn that it is simply the quality of the headphones that I am hearing . The same thing happened with our digital piano , I thought I was hearing the piano outside of my headphones as well as inside them , but that was not the case . Anyone who is disappointed by these either has ridiculous expectations , or they do not know what sound quality is.Update 2/15/2013So , I wanted to get on here and make another comment on the comfort and noise reduction . I have put them on when I sat down at my computer , only to realize an hour later I was still wearing them , and not listening to any music . They are comfortable enough to forget that they are on , and the are noise cancelling enough that they literally cut the noise levels in the room in half . I continue to love them .	1
First bought these back in 1995 along with a Sony diskman with my first paycheck . These headphones have been used along with my Sony Diskman , iPods ( gen 1 , 3 and 6 ) , home stereo and gaming pc 's since I got them . It has outlived most of the tech I had plugged them into and kept on kicking until a friend stole them . Bought a replacement pair in 2009 on Amazon and just got around to reviewing them.These headphones sound great when I first bought them and still do now . They opened my ears to cleaner sounds when listening to music that default electronic headphones do n't pick up.I have taken these with me while riding the bus , long car trips and on the airplane . They can be compacted to be taken on the go and stuffed in a bag . So they are very portable even come with a leatherish bag to be carried in . They are very comfortable enough to be worn for extended periods of time . Even taken long naps and slept with them over night . They do make your head warm after extended hours of use but that goes for any over the ear headphones . They are very adjustable you can wear them on one ear and the other behind the head and wont fell like your head is in a vice.Only problem I ever had with them is that the earpads start to flake off after a while . But you can get replacement pads that do n't flake . But I cant knock the rating down for that since I had these for such a long time and since it has outlived several gaming headsets just to get plugged back in .	1
and terrific sound . You do n't need to spend $ 200+ on the good doctor 's prescription : ) . These are a very wise , economical , and sound worthy choice .	1
I purchased these on Black Friday , I use them for my Ipod Touch 4th Generation . The sound these produce completely removed the need to use any EQ settings on my IPod.I mostly listen to Pop , Rock , and Rap so I can say Highs are great , Mids are good , bass is excellent and clear , and no noise distortion.I ca n't speak to how well the build of the Headphones will last overtime , but so far they seem durable.They are a good choice if you plan on owning a HIGH QUALITY or audiophile version of headphones.The only thing I absolutely HATE is the LONGGGGGGG CABLE . I ca n't work it with it , it dangles over my legs , jumps up and down with me . If Sony could make a short version cable these would easily destroy , Beats , Souls , Audio Technica and all of the otherhighly marketed headphones .	1
I 'm listening to Linda Ronstadt singing , Someone to Watch Over Me , as I write this . The sound is clear . There is no overbearing bass , just enough , the high notes sparkle like NYE champagne , and , Linda 's Voice is wonderful , fantastic . The headphones do n't get in the way of the music .	1
I 've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment . I use them at work and they are very comfortable and the sound is of very high quality , much better than the earbuds I was using before . The included carrying case is another bonus , as is the folding design which makes these headphones portable enough to take on a plane .	1
I bought a pair for record monitoring about 20 years ago and liked them so much I bought a second set before they were discontinued . The retailer I got them from is long gone but these babies are still available . Not that I need them , they still function perfectly . I keep one on the computer and one on the stereo . They are not the best sounding cans I 've heard as I own a set of Stax . BUT they are the best monitors I 've ever used . A little hot/harsh above 10KHz but that 's what you need to hear what you 've got . They can smell any clipping . The Stax earpads have gotten flaky but these Sony 's have aged well . They get dropped , ripped off my head etc . all the time , no problem . They fold up compactly in a travel pouch and plug into anything . I wear them for hours comfortably . I have other Sonys , Sennheisers , Beyers and others that I ca n't listen to anymore because of these . There is no better value that I know of .	1
Sony MDR series headphones been always one of the best , no wonder many professional studios are using it ! I use mine to play guitar at late and do n't bother the neighbors . Once in a while the ear pad has to be replaced [ B001DFX2OC	1
I bought these headphones to replace my Sony MDR-V300 headphones , which are the cheapest pieces of plastic garbage I 've ever seen . The V6 's produce a beautiful sound and allowed me to hear details in my music I never knew existed . I 've got a Denon-Bose audio setup worth about $ 2000 and these headphones sound better.These headphones are ridiculous . They 're worth about $ 300 by my standards . It also appears they are built to last , as most of the parts are robust plastic or metal instead Sony 's normal cheap sh**.Update : the little wires that run to the speakers are unable to withstand an encounter with a housecat . I strongly recommend not leaving these headphones along with your carniverous pets .	1
For the price , you ca n't beat these . I 'm an audio nut . These headphones are balanced . Very versatile . Great quality and comfortable fit . Ca n't see a headphone beating these out ( for the price ) . They sound like $ 300+ headphones .	1
I 've owned two pair of these headphones over the years . This pair was a gift for my grandson . There was a problem with them when I received them . The insulation on the cable was pulling away at the earphones . I returned them and Amazon immediately replaced them . If I ever need another pair this is what I 'll buy again .	1
I purchased my Sony MDR-V6 headphones in my very early teens ( if not earlier ) after reading a review in Stereo Review ( I believe ) . Since then , they 've gotten tons of use and I 've seen them everywhere . I 've gone through 3 or 4 cords over the years and they 're finally falling apart . I wanted another pair but settled ( ha ! ) on MDRV600 's , which are very muddy - all mids . They 're going back today to Best Buy and I 'm getting a new set of V6 's from here -- I ca n't believe Sony has kept this model alive so long . These are incredible 'phones . Trust me.For alternatives , get the following : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AJIF4E ? ie=UTF8 & camp ; =213733 & creative ; =393177 & creativeASIN ; =B000AJIF4E & linkCode ; =shr & tag ; =swiclu-20 & linkId ; =IRBSUAR6ER2W4QD7Fairly comparable of its range ... .	1
I have bought many headphones and found that these sound more professional than my most expensive headphones . These cans are legendary in the audio world . With a flat frequency response , they are very EQ friendly . These headphones will definitely tell you the quality of your music so it is best to have your MP3 's with the highest bitrate possible , or use FLAC whenever you can . I have read that some people are disappointed with the sound , it is not the headphones ! ! ! It is your music source and the equipment used . It is best that you have some kind of headphone amplifier or good audio gear to drive them as ipods and the like do not have the power to properly push them.These are my go to headphones when I want to have a good listening experience.As a last note , Sony has quietly retired the MDR-V6 's after nearly 30 years of service ! ! ! ! I ordered an extra pair just in case and I also have the MDR-7506 as well but prefer the old tried and true MDR-V6.Get them while you can and beware of knock-offs ! ! !	1
In reading the reviews here , I noticed there were a few reviewers that said these headphones were too tight around their heads . This left me concerned about whether or not I should buy these or continue looking . After all , they did n't include any head measurements that I could use to compare my own head with.On the other hand , most reviewers said the sound quality was excellent . So I went ahead and ordered a pair.I received them today , and I 'm happy to report these headphones are very comfortable on my head . ( my head measurement = 21 3/4 inches which is 55 centimeters ) The headphones stay firmly on my head even when I turn my head . I do n't hear any type of distortion when I turn my head . I wear glasses and the headphones are still comfortable on my ears.Without any stretching , the cord is long enough to go down to the floor and then around to the back of my PC which sits on the floor below my desk . The cord will stretch out longer . The cord does n't pull on the headphones or provide any type of discomfort.The sound quality is excellent as stated by the other reviewers . In fact , I have the volume turned almost all the way down on iTunes and I can still hear the music very clearly.I would recommend these headphones .	1
This was my first headphone 15years ago . A sony seller frind of my fayher gifted it to me . It was already old but I loved it . All of you can notice . This is the headphone with less 1 star in amazon . Only 2 % .. Yes ihave had sennheiser . They are less confy.Good and bads1-its really neutral . Sound is great and i know from experience that the speakers will last years.2 . The cord is strong.3 . Its comfortable . I could sleep wih them on.4.I connected it to my component and damn . My ears vibrated.5.If taken care of they will las years . Can be modded and repaired.6.I use them with my phone.7 . Best headphone dor the price.8 . This is a neutral headphone . It reproduces things just like they were recorded . If you want trebles or lots of basd you will have to do it with the Equalizer . Its great since i listen to all kinds of music .	1
I have a small recording studio and bought these for mixing phones after reading some reviews . These have a great clear sound , not too bottom heavy like some headphones can be ... .they can hurt alittle after you wear them for awhile but over all these are really great headphones for everything from mixing to just listening to your favorite tunes .	1
I agree with other reviewers about the sound quality and build quality etc . Excellent product on its own.But this is not for someone who loves bass like me . I ended up buying another extra bass SONY XB700 which is much more bassy .	1
I dont really want to write a long review because I am not the biggest audiophile ever.I just wanted decent headphones for a decent price.I will say these are just about worth exactly how much they cost . the sound is amazing . everything sounds amazing and it has the perfect amount of bass and treble and with minimal adjusting I 'm sure I could make whatever changes I wanted to make them sound better.BIGGEST COMPLAINTthese headphones are ok to wear for an hour of use , but after that I find my ears in horrible pain ... I have to adjust where they sit on my head cuz it really does hurt , I dont know why they push so hard against your head . I usually wear a hat when I listen to them because it delays them hurting for a while.Otherwise , they dont like like incredible quality.For the sound they are incredible . but I wouldnt get them again cuz they hurt so much.If you are looking for comfortable listening then these might not be the bestbut they sound good and block out a bunch of sound .	1
I bought these to monitor vocals from a Sony M10 and boom mic during amateur filming , and to double as a portable set of cans for casual listening.When they first arrived I plugged them into my soundcard and listened for about an hour . I was satisfied but not thrilled the way that so many others have been . The V6 's are legends but I did n't see what all the hype was about . I mean they sounded good for the price , but not to the degree I was anticipating . Bass is very good , treble is very sparkly and bright , but the mids are unacceptably recessed , and even at times sound hidden , or veiled . Treble was riddled with sibilance too , not good . Now , at home I typically listen to AD-700s which have incredible mid-range . Furthermore I understand that the V6 's get better and better with burn-in . We shall see . At this point I was just meh about the V6 's . Then I remembered what I really bought them for.I brought up some high-bitrate voice recordings that are stored on my PC . WOW . These cans have incredible detail . Very , very analytical . I auditioned almost everything in the low-end pro monitoring segment ( i.e . Shure SRH440 , ARK 8400 , AT M40fs , etc . etc ) . For pure analytical work such as vocal tracking none come close except maybe the Shure 's which are so bass shy that they are almost a non-consideration . So bottom line is if you are in the sub $ 100 segment for the same reasons as me then you want these . If you want JUST good phones for listening on a bus or in the library I 'd get Audio Technica M40fs or M35 which are less power hungry , more comfy and have a slightly more engaging overall sound . But for a good multi-purpose headphone with no compromises in vocal detail and an impulse-buy price point these simply ca n't be beat , and after all these years .	1
First , the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful . They are not boomy , but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs , and everything in between sounds equally as nice . The cord coils nicely and does n't tangle , entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other end.The `` funky mechanics '' that I refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband . The headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones . I also find myself being ( overly ? ) careful when collapsing/expanding the headphones , but maybe that 's just my paranoia considering the cost.The sound quality is without par in any headphones I have ever had and I would definitely buy another pair IF these do n't fall apart mechanically within the next couple of years .	1
These are so good I bought another pair . my little bastard cat ate one of the little wires that hang and it broke one of the ears but since sony makes such good stuff I was able to fix it with a little razor and some black tape . I use these to keep my girlfriend from hearing when I write songs about how much I want to kill that cat .	1
Very good headphones . More 'bassy ' than my Grado SR60 headphones which are in the same price range . However , these phones surround the entire ear which accounts for some of the additional bass whereas the Grado phones sit on the ear and allow for more `` soundstage '' and in my opinion more accurate sound . The Sony phones shut out much more of the room noise than the Grado phones do because of their 'sealed ' design . The Grados do n't shut out any room noise at all by comparison so if you listen in a noisy place you may want to go with these Sonys . These phones are good for editing , DJs , microphone usage etc . They are fairly comfortable . Much more than the Sennheisers I tried on , not as much as the Grados . However , I do n't find any headphones `` comfortable '' really .	1
Not as much bass as i thought . But it 's not supposed to i guess . Just for the studio to get true sound . I need bass headphones though .	1
If you love the MDR-7506s , you will love the V6s . I was hesitant to switch but after many promising years with my 7506s , I did not feel alienated with the V6 headphones . If I had $ 350 to spend on headphones , I would still get these any day of the week . Rich bass , excellent vocals , and pristine clear sound overall . Anyone who works radio , podcasts , or records music will want these .	1
Well , I ca n't praise these headphones enough , they sound amazing on the average computer , with nothing but a headphone output , and they shine like the sun through an amp and equalizer . They even work very well with the Ipod touch , which can tend to be underpowered for larger diaphragm headphones such as these , but once again , they did n't fail to perform . The voice coil is perfect for being able to keep things neat while sitting at a desk , but still being able to have your headphones on , and run over to the shelf , or even stretch them to a close-by room , not kidding ! I just can not get over the sound quality for such an inexpensive set of headphones . My only gripe is that within the first couple months , I 've had to have the ear cups replaced by Sony ( free of charge ) and multiple people seem to have this problem . I bought a pair of Beyerdynamic cups : Beyerdynamic Velour Earcushions MDR7506 HeadphonesAnd they seem like they will last . Otherwise , the metal frame , and chamber are impressive , and the hefty cord and ends seem like they 'll last a good long time . Although they 're a little chunky/old fashioned to bring in public for some people , I do n't have much of a problem with the design . It 's very comfortable for long periods of wear as well.EDIT : These were purchased April 3rd of 2012 , and the right earcup has stopped working as of September 14th 2013 , they served me QUITE WELL indeed for the time I 've had them but this is really unacceptable , especially considering all of the amazing reviews I 've read for how long other customers have had these for . Has the quality of construction gone down ? I 'll try to update my review as for the experience of RMA'ing them or getting them repaired , and how much it costs .	1
Pros : Cons : Uncolored sound . Some people may find that these headphones feel warm , or cause sweatingFlat frequency response curve . during prolonged use.Excellent frequency response range . Not many cons IMO . These are the best , cleanest sounding headphones that ITight , clean , punchy bass response . have heard in the $ 100 or less category . They are monitors , and they do notClear , crisp , but not overwhelming highs . color the sound in any way . They are meant to accurately reproduce theGood clean midrange . source material . Enjoy your new Sony headphones . : - ) Lightweight , and comfortable even duringextended use .	1
I ca n't believe I got by for years without owning these , as a music lover.I got chills right away the first time I cranked up some favorite tunes with these new ( old ) cans . ( Well , new to me . ) The frequency response is supposedly 5-30K Hz . At this price point , you 'd be hard pressed to find better , I should think.Good seal over the ears without being uncomfortable after a while . GREAT sound.Short and sweet , well worth the cost .	1
I love these . They accompany my Sansa Clip+ perfectly . After burning them in for 40hours and RockBoxing my clip , I could not be happier with my $ 115.00 total portable audio solution ( Sansa Clip+ MDR-V6 . These sound great with iPods as well ! Bass , mids and highs are great for musical scores , hip hop , electronica , big band jazz , and classical . Great buy !	1
These headphones have a very nice sound and are very comfortable . I use them while playing my electronic piano and they seem to deliver a true and full sound . They collapse into a fairly small size and have a nice storage pouch . The cord is a bit short but otherwise they 're great .	1
this headphones are amazing , the sound is really good and the quality of the product is excellent , this headphones are really comfortable , and it did n't weight too much .	1
These are great headphones ! I work in the music industry and for the price point , I would rather buy these versus any of the higher price Sony MDR models .	1
I have a set of Sennheiser 590 headphones and I must say these do have more detail and clarity . They are very comfortable to wear . I highly recommend them . They are also very efficient ( does n't take a lot of power to drive them ) . I bought the Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour ear cushions to put on them , and did they make a difference . Very comfortable .	1
I studied everything on the market , and shopped all around for the best product I could find . I was told to look for the greatest frequency response on the market . These headphones have a frequency response of 5 Hz - 30 kHz . I found that I could have gotten a lower rated Hz , but at a cost of over $ 200 . That was not an acceptable price for my budget.These headphones are very comfortable , reasonably priced , have a longer cord than absolutely necessary , have adapters for different size plugs , and outstanding quality of sound . What more do you want ? ; o )	1
With over 1000 reviews on these why add yet another . Aw , what the heck ... I purchased my first pair of MDR-V6s when they first came out in the 80s . You need to realize that a driver that could faithfully reproduce sound down to and BELOW 20Hz was unheard of in consumer audio at that time . These phones stunned me when I was able to hear content on certain recordings that I had never heard before - mostly in the spectrum from 80Hz and down . This was an unusual experience via headphones . The clarity and truthfulness of the audio the MDR-V6s produce is stunning to those who value accurate audio reproduction . Their ability to deliver very high volume levels without distortion is a joy ( in moderation - doing this too often WILL result in hearing loss ) . They are even more stunning when one considers the price compared to the more esoteric audiophile phones available that can run 10 to 20 times more in price.I had that first pair of phones for about 12 years before someone stepped on the frame and snapped one of the driver 's clean off . I replaced them with a new pair which I still own . They are pushing 15 years old now and still sound very good . After an estimated 5000 hours of use , the ear pads are flaking off and the left driver had begun to occasionally break-up on high volume , low frequency content . So I have ordered my third pair of these beauties over the course of almost 30 years . Thank you , Sony , for continuing to manufacture this excellent product at an amazing price.A popular trend in headphone design today involves intentional gain manipulation over certain frequencies - mostly on the low end ( Beats by Dr. Dre ) . If they sound good to you , who am I to tell you different ? I personally enjoy hearing recordings as close to their original mix as possible . The MDR-V6s do that extremely well . When you can actually hear the full audio spectrum delivered with very little coloration , you might be surprised at how enjoyable some recordings are with little or no adjustments to the equalization.The only shortcoming on these phones is the fact that the wire that runs from the left ear cup up and over to the right ear cup is exposed where it travels over the stainless steel band on each side . This is a pretty small gauge wire and if you accidentally pulled on it when removing the earphones or pulling them out of a backpack , there is a possibility of the wire being damaged . And if that wire is ever broken , it is basically impossible to repair . Nearly all headphones use very fine stranded , coated wiring . The coating makes it practically impossible to repair once broken . It can not be soldered or twisted together . So if you are rough with your phones , consider this.If accuracy is important to you look no further . Buy these , then buy a backup pair !	1
I 've been using various Sony headphones throughout my 27 years on this planet , and have always been more than happy with them , but I 've always just stuck with the cheaper models . Recently , I decided to buy some new headphones . I tried out some other brands , such as Sennheiser , but in the end I decided to come home to Sony.This is the first time I 've bought a pair of headphones in this price range , and all I can say is , I wish I had spent the money on these years ago ! I had no idea what I was missing ! The sound is very smooth yet precise , the bass response is just right and the highs are not overly bright ( like the Sennheisers I tried ) .I 've generally never cared for over-the-ear cans ( most ones I 've tried either squeezed my head or irritated my ears ) , but these are super comfortable . I 've been wearing them all day ( in fact I 'm listening to them right now ) , and although my ears are a tiny bit sweaty after wearing them all day , they are still perfectly comfortable.For those of you that are on the fence about stepping up to the $ 60+ price range , I would say you absolutely need to get these . They are worth every penny .	1
Only had these for about a week and so far only listened to them through a laptop 's 1/8 in jack using one of iTunes ' streaming radio & # 34 ; electronica & # 34 ; stations , 128 kbps . These phones sound great . I feel like I am there in GayFM 's club . I 'm not gay but that 's none of anyone 's business anyway ! The headphones come with a built in 1/8 jack and a comes with a 1/4 adapter . The coiled cable is great and stays out of the way . So far comfort is ok , a little snub but not uncomfortable . I have big ears and the cup seals fit around my whole ear . I have n't worn them for longer than an hour so I ca n't say about comfort longevity . The bass is surprisingly full and highs are crisp . I like a thick bass sound and I sampled one of iTunes ' 320kbps electronica radio channels . The bass sounds incredible through these . The earcups flip over 180 in case you need to use them like a DJ . I never owned a fancy set of phones before so I ca n't really make any comparisons . I like to think I have a pretty distinguishing ear and my ear likes the sound from these headphones . You get a great sound for the price . I had the studio MDR7506 model in my wish list for about a year then saw these at a discount price so I went ahead and got them . The wider freq range sold me ( I do n't know about audio features but sounded reasonable to me wider is better ) . I have n't had a chance to try each side by side so I hope I made the right choice in going cheaper . So far , I am satisfied until I hear a better sounding model .	1
Ive listened to the Ultrasone HFI-780 , Sony MDR-V6 ( MDR-7506 ) , Grado SR80i , and the Sennheiser HD598 . The HD598 wins.The Ultrasone HFI-780 has absolutely terrible sibilance/sibilant . This is a common complaint with these cans . The 780 has better bass than the HD598 , but the sibilance ruins these cans . Not even listenable.The Sony MDR-V6 ( aka MDR-7506 ) are phenomenal cans , but rather boring . These are some of the most popular headphones ever made , for good reason . They do sound incredible , and they are inexpensive . Every sound is fantastic . However , it can be boring for people who are not used to it . People in the audio industry refer to them as flat , and flat is the perfect way to describe them . And some people love this sound , it grows on you after a while . The MDR-V6 are studio monitors , which mean they are primarily made to be used in a studio or with other professional applications where you can monitor how loud a particular sound is . These cans heavily emphasize the mids , and thats not necessarily a bad thing . Those who love acoustic music or love hearing vocals will prefer these over the HD598 . Some treble and some & # 34 ; hissing & # 34 ; can be heard on occasion , but overall these are amazing headphones if you like flat sound . The bass is very nice and never muddles the midrange or treble . Isolation is actually really good . I do have a problem with the left side of the headphone . If I move my head at all , and I mean at all , a part of the headband makes a swearing sound . I fixed it by wrapping some material around it . An easy fix but I should not have had to do this . These cans provide excellent detail , but can also be unforgiving on recordings that are subpar . Overall , excellent phones and I highly recommend them to everyone.The Grado SR80i are another great set of headphones , but they are uncomfortable and dont appear to be made as well as the other headphones on this list . Overall they sound great . The bass is almost non-existent , like the HD598 . The overall sound signature was not as clean as the MDR-V6 . The MDR-V6 is just so clean and precise , very hard to beat . But the SR80i are still great headphones and I would probably prefer to listen to music and game with them more than the Sony 's . The Grado 's sound like what you are used to , which is not studio monitor headphones.Now the Sennheiser HD598 . I have the least experience with these , but they are so good I dont need extensive experience . They are extremely comfortable , excellent sound reproduction , and excellent soundstage . I 've listened to many gaming headphones in the $ 50 price range and these are several tiers above them in every way . Soundstage is so important in gaming , especially first person shooters . I use these with Battlefield 3 and they always accurately pinpoint all the sounds . Music is crystal clear and silky smooth . No sibilance or harshness ever hear . I do wish they had more bass , but the open nature of these cans makes these bass light . Well made and sound great for an affordable price .	1
Great sound , durable , comfortable , and very reasonably priced . I purchased these in 2009 and have not regretted my decision once . I like these headphones so much that whenever a friend or coworker is looking for a new pair of headphones , I immediately recommend these ones . I think 3 of my fiends have also purchased them after trying them . I even had a friend exchange his Beats for these.What I like : -Great sound profile , with just the right amount of base-Comfortable : I can wear these for hours without having to take them off or adjust them-Long , coiled cord : Because of the coil design it is only a couple of feet long , which makes it manageable . If you need it longer it easily stretches ( but not strains ) to several more feet.-Comes with an adapter : This comes in handy when I need to plug them into my receiver-Because of the over the ear design of the headphones , they block out sound nicely . I can use them on an airplane without having to crank up the volume and or losing quality because of the ambient noise . They also do a good job blocking out ambient noise in coffee shops and long road trips in the car.What I do n't like : - Maybe a little bulky to wear in public , but that has n't stopped me from using it on mass transit.Buy them , you will not be disappointed !	1
Paid $ 67 on Amazon . Bought these for my Dad for Christmas , along with an mp3 player . Very good sound quality . Picked up some aftermarket earpads based on previous reviews and are very comfortable . Definetly recommended .	1
I 've had my MDR-V6 's so long , I ca n't remember when I bought them . At that time , they were highly recommended . They still are . That should tell you something . Second recommendation : Do you watch any concerts via DVD ? Ever notice performers wearing a traditional set of headphones ? Those pros are often wearing MDR-V6 's ; they 're distinctive , with a red horizontal stripe across the back of each driver.Two issues : Vinyl coating that flakes off the ear cups ; when it happens , just peel the rest off . The fuzzy fabric beneath ends up being more comfortable than the vinyl , since it 'breathes ' and your ears stay cooler.Electrostatic discharge ( zaps to your ears , in a dry wintry environment ) ; I fixed that , by removing one ear cup , and attached a fine brass wire loop that I grounded to the neutral wire that serves the L & R drivers . This fine wire shows / is visible inside the ear cup . In use , this rests on my ear ( not detectable as pressure on the ear ) and constantly drains off any static electricity buildup . Bottom line : no more zaps ; So , ya want GREAT headphones ? Buy 'em and enjoy 'em .	1
I have used these headphones for a few months now and I felt it was time to finally write a review . I have used them for listening to music , watching videos , and playing computer games . The audio quality is very balanced and if anything the sound feels a little light or thin , but if you add bass through an equilizer , it will come through . They are extremely comfortable and I can wear them for long periods of time . I was impressed at first with how much they also deaden any external noise , too . The cord should be long enough for any setting and the storage bag is nice enough . Overall , I do n't regret this purchase at all and I would recommend them to a friend .	1
Great price and good quality , Belkin is always dependable . The length is perfect for some temporary work areas and I have used it many times .	1
I recently had to move my COMPUTER . In doing so I used this USB cable to extend the reach of my MOUSE . What I like most about BELKIN USB cables is that they do n't pull apart at the joints as easily as the other LESS EXPENSIVE ones !	1
Not much you can really add to such a device as an extension cable . They either work or they do n't and these two do ... ..so I 'm happy . If you need to extend your usb device then these is a great purchase .	1
Works well . I used this as part of a wok-fi ( wifi-antenna ) . A strainer served as a receiver dish , and boosted my signal , since my home 's wifi-does n't completely reach my shop , unassisted .	1
Now I can plug my iPad in almost anywhere in my home . What a great find . Very happy with this product .	1
Works great ! Exactly what I needed for my room . Running a connection through the e-sata to my computer and through usb to my ps3 . ( just not at the same time . )	1
This works perfect to plug our external hard drive into out HDTV so the hard drive is n't hanging from the back of the TV . We watch 1080 HD movies through it every weekend ! ! And the price is excellent too ! ! ! Way cheaper than the cable I found in the electronic stores ! ! Highly recommend !	1
What else can I say ? it works and its worth the money . I trust Belkin , they make great products	1
Just what I needed at the time , I 'm not sure it 's going to handle 3 couputers , I 'll know soon , Thanks for your help . Ralph	1
I stand by MOST of my old review , BUT after using the Epic a bit more , I 've found that the Spot Metering is a good workaround for some of the camera 's shutter-priority programming . Put that Spot meter to careful use , and you can get more depth-of-field and less flash use . Also , after days of heavy rain recently here in California , the Weather Resistant features are nice , too . This camera really IS a great value ! OLD REVIEW : I 'd suggest finding an old Olympus XA in good condition instead of this mostly pre-programmed techno-cam , although it does have a sharp lens..and it 's very small and light too . But the autofocus is a little touchy , and it wants to shoot at f2.8 in any kind of even slightly low light . With the XA , you can choose any aperture ( or ISO ! ) you want , and the lens is even sharper..of course , you might have to use a tripod too , but the Stylus Epic wo n't really acknowledge that choice ! However , within its ' parameters , it 's a slick little camera , and you really should n't have to pay too much for it ; refurbished ones go for under $ 50 .	1
I have recently rediscovered film photography and have aquired this famous point and shoot . Film is still a great affordable option for high quality pictures if you scan your negatives . Plus without an LCD to worry about how the last picture looked , I can focus on taking the next picture.Right out of the box , the size impressed me , it is one of the most compact 35mm cameras I 've ever seen in person . Only a Canon Elph is smaller , but that 's basically a rectangle . The Stylus Epic is one of the best handling cameras I 've ever touched . Modern digitals are mostly rectangles , but the Stylus has a great tapered design that feels great in your hand . The shape is also perfect for sliding in your pocket . The sliding cover is also the on/off switch , so there 's no odd buttons or switches to slow you down . On top of that , loading film could n't be easier.My main concern is that the camera is rather loud when it advances film , so its not exactly a subtle camera , but otherwise I am glad I picked this up.Update : having just developed a few rolls , I am very impressed by the optics of this camera . Just a `` generic '' 400 speed film yielded pleasing results , but I noticed some quirks . First of all , due to the rather wide lens , you want to get up close and fill the frame ... but the lens can not focus closer than about arms reach . Not much of a problem for most situations , but closeups are n't really suited to this camera . And then there is the flash ... yikes ! If you can avoid it ( and you can with fast film and a steady hand ) , do not use the flash ...	1
I love radios and have owned over thirty . I am constantly looking for the holy grail - a radio with great reception and plenty of features . I have n't found that yet but I can do comparisons . Here are the pros and cons of this one : Pros:1 ) This is truly a pocket radio and very light . It feels lighter than a deck of cards.2 ) Digital tuning - a rarity in pocket radios . You can quickly scan from station to station and from AM to FM to TV.3 ) Has a speaker built in . You do n't need headphones . The sound quality is adequate for talk radio and AM music . The volume is adequate for quiet environments.4 ) It has TV audio and the reception was ok on the four major stations in my area.Cons:1 ) There is no built in FM telescoping antenna . You need to insert headphones or the included wire and switch it to speaker in order to get most FM stations . A small telescoping antenna would have been an improvement . I find the hanging wire annoying and I think it is just a matter of time before I lose the wire.2 ) The reception is not as great as the Amazon review suggests . I found that there was a good deal of static on several AM stations and AM is very dirctional . FM was great on headphones , though.3 ) The cary case is a joke . It looks like an afterthought . It is a membrane thin piece of vinyl that will not protect the radio.4 ) The ear buds are also a joke.5 ) Weather reception was the worst I have ever heard on a modern radio.6 ) The tuning light is bright and , no doubt , draining the batteries like crazy.If you are looking for a pocket radio that is digital and has a built in speaker , this will do . I see lots of room for improvement , though . I also think it is overpriced . I think it should be 39.99 . It would be about right at that price .	1
I 've had a lot of problems with other radios to obtain adequate reception in my home area . This radio was far superior and brought in all the stations clearly . I wish that the user interface was easier to use but the performance makes up for it . No regrets .	1
I have a Radio Shack branded version of this unit ... same design ... works fine ... good sound , memory works as supposed to ... reception seems solid ... recommend	1
I have bought two of these radios and worn them out . Now I have bought a third DT100 , and I see this model has been discontinued.My first DT 100 was bought from CCRANE . I used this radio until I accidentally killed the radio by dropping it.My second DT110 lasted for years , and was damaged when I shipped my belongings cross country to Washington . So I bought the Sony Walkman SRF-M37V.The Sony had pre-sets , and similar size . The Sony also has Weather , and TV audio.The sound quality of the Sony was always a disappointment.The band button is a real problem.The Sony eats aaa batteries.The Sony has no 90 minute off switch to save batteries.The Sony has no lock switch that prevents the assorted buttons from doing their thing . The ^ } *= # # { band button is on the front of the radio.I primarily listen via a pillow speaker , and some times I accidentally hit the stupid band button and my station is gone until I turn the lights back on and find out which band I have wandered into.The Sangean 110 had AWESOME sound quality . Almost as good as CD on strong stations . I would recommend that you toss the ear buds that comes with the radio ang get Marshmallow or Skull Candy headphones , and the sound quality will surpass your ecpectations.In closing bye bye Sony ! I 'M GOING BACK TO SANGEAN !	1
After trying a few different radios , including the Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE , this one is still the best . FM reception is un-equaled by any other radio I have , plus very good AM and SW sensitivity . Many more features than the YB400 . Very decent sound from the speaker and superb sound from a good pair of headphones . The Yacht Boy might sound a little better ( the speaker is at least twice the size ) , but I still love playing with this little gem.There are characteristics about all radios that each individual would like to have in their ideal radio and you can read a few of those in the other reviews . However , I personally ca n't think of anything I wish were different about this radio , other than I would n't take it to the beach and expose it to the salt air . Otherwise , it goes everywhere . It 's also the radio I use most often in the house . And for the price you can get it for , it 's more than worth it.I guess instead of just repeating a lot of what has already been written , I 'll just say I 've bought three !	1
It 's got everything I needed in a compact battery powered radio.As others have noted , the tuning floats a little over time , but the SW and AM and FM bands work fine . Good for the garage or working in the yard .	1
This is a coat-pocket sized portable with a very basic design . It can tune 10 shortwave broadcast bands but none of the ham or utility frequencies between.Its performance on all bands is decent , especially compared to other small portables . It covers more shortwave bands than many . Sound is not great , but again , it 's good compared to others in this class.I would recommend it as a radio to pack along on trips . It works fairly well and can be had cheaply enough that if it were lost or stolen it would n't ruin your life . It would also be good for those , including the visually impaired , who have difficulty running a general coverage set with a digital display . Or for those who just do n't want to .	1
I own on of these and love it so much I got my brother one for Christmas . Though small , this radio has great reception of regular and shortwave channels , without any sort of cumbersome antenna wire to deal with . The batteries last a long , long time , even when I fell asleep and left it on all night a couple times . Just do n't break the antenna off right away , which I always seem to do ! Anyone would have fun with this . ( Oh , and it 's VERY sturdy . I actually did a human cannonball thing , diving face first onto mine , when holding onto the dog 's leash as it saw a cat , and though I got a black eye , the radio was unscathed and still working great . )	1
I first encountred this radio when sold under the Radio Shack brand as the DX-350 in Alamogordo , Otero County , N.M.We are at the base of the Sacramento Mtns. , in the White Sands Basin.I wanted a small radio I could take hiking in the Sacramentos , and this one fit the bill for size.I was amazed at how it could pull signals in the canyons of the mountains on all bands.It is remarkably durable , surviving a 50 foot fall and an auto wreck and kept on working.It finally gave up the ghost , and I hunted for years to find another.Well here it is.Anyone who wants a quality multi-band reciever comparable in all ways to the Grundig will find this little radio to fill the bill.For the money , you cant beat it ! [ ASIN : B0000228GF Sangean SG-622 FM 12 band shortwave World Band Radio . ]	1
I had this model up until two years when my wife got mad at me one time and threw it across the room ( about 15 ft ) . Needless to say , the radio assumed room temperature : ) It gave up the ghost ! However , it is definately solidly built and is absolutely loaded with almost every feature a shortwave listener would want ... even SSB ( single sideband ) reception by using a built in BFO ( beat frequency oscillator switch for upper ... and lower sideband ! RF gain switch is handy when you 're close to an a.m. station . With headphones you can listen to stereo FM . Get this radio if you are serious about shortwave ... and get the portable roll up antenna for really improving SW reception . This radio has my very highest recommendatiion ! OH ... I am getting a new one sometime soon to replace the one that went airborne for about a second !	1
This is a great swicth with low price . I use it together with D-Link DI-704 4-port internet sharing router to build my home network with 1 PC , two servers , one PowerMac and a laptop connected to cable modem ISP . Connecting via the swicth for internet sharing does n't show any noticeable slow-response as compared to connecting via the router directly . It works well by itself as we as with D-Link DI-704 .	1
I first went to local retailers to comparison shop and found competitive products generally priced two to three times as much . So , I decided to give the D-Link a try . I powered down my Hewlett Packard running Windows ME and installed the new hardware . I chose to use the optional AC Power adapter , because I was hooking up the & quot ; Viking - Intelliflash smart card reader & quot ; and wanted to ensure enough power.Upon rebooting Windows ME automatically recognized the product and installed the required driver . I verified the installation under & quot ; control panel/system/universal serial bus controllers. & quot ; It was newly listed as a & quot ; general purpose USB hub. & quot ; I ca n't imagine anyone having problem adding this hub to his or her existing system.I give it a perfect 5 for ease of installation and excellent value .	1
When the number of USB devices here exceded the number of ports on my Dell Dimension , I shopped around for a 4 port USB hub . This unit looked appealing ; not only did it come with a 6 foot USB cable , it could be powered by the computer USB port or from it 's own wall wart power supply . When it arrived , it was an easy and straight forward install . Plug the supplied cable into the hub , plug the hub into the computer 's USB port , plug the devices into the hub , you 're done . Turning the computer 's power on , five LEDs lit up green . One LED for each port and one showing the hub is running from the computer 's power supply . A red LED lights to show when the HUB 's wall wart is supplying the power . Elegant simplicity in a translucent package , the most difficult thing to expect in setting this up is opening the blister pack to get at it .	1
This is an excellent product . Installation was super easy . Performance is flawless . It 's pretty nice not having to pull my computer out of it 's corner and try to find usb ports in the dark . Even if you do n't need extra ports it 's nice to have them all out front .	1
Really like this antenna . just wish it was a bit longer , like a total of 30 feet long . Have it set up in living room near ceiling and does what it is suppose to do .	1
Easy to use and put away . I kept the one that came with the radio with the radio . I put this one up permanently at home for quick use .	1
I used this antenna in the house this Winter and it worked out well on my Tecsun 660 sw radio . I use another type of antenna I built for summer and outdoors but this antenna could be hung out a window and hung as high as possible . They say position to the North for best reception . Have to go to the Web and look up sw info . to location and time of year . I really like that it plugs into the radio and has an adapter if needed to clip onto the antenna .	1
This converter has everything you need while traveling abroad . Good fit , good function , good price . A real necessity !	1
I have purchased many switches and have found the Netgear ones such as this 8 port to be very dependable . As with all lan switches however , even these are vulnerable to electrical surges so they should be installed behind high quality surge protection .	1
This 10/100 megabit switch is great if you are starting to feel the squeeze of a 10 megabit network . If you 're like me , it getting pretty old moving huge scanned pictures and other large files around the home LAN . At 10 megabits , it typically took me 20-30 minutes to get a CDR worth of scanned images over to my CDR writing machine for backup . Well , not any more ! Since I hooked up my FS-108 , I can move a CDR worth of images or MP3 files ( 650 megs worth ) in about 3-4 minutes instead of that 20-30.This switch is a piece of art . Built like a tank , incredibly solid and small for what it does . No fan , so it makes no noise whatsoever . The switch hooked up painlessly and worked flawlessly from the get-go .	1
This switch is now located behind my entertainment center . It handles the Xbox , satellite , blueray , desktop computer and a spare wire for a laptop . It does a great job and the price including shipping was better than the local shops .	1
I needed to be able to connect components in my home theater system and this was PERFECT for the job . Yes , there are a couple of these even cheaper , but sometimes you do get what you pay for . This is a hefty little box for the size and it feels quite solid and well made . While I agree with a couple comments regarding the location of the power plug , it was not a deal killer for me at all . It sits back behind everything and is in no way an eyesore among my TV and game gear . I have it connected to an XBox , my DVR , a Sony BluRay player and have one port still available if I ever decide to connect my TV . I ran an ethernet cable from the modem/router in my media room into the family room via the attic , and once connected , all components worked immediately with no issues at all . We ended up using the extra port for a few days while we were having problems with our wireless network before the replacement router arrived , and the connections on the notebooks were excellent as well . ( Wireless module had gone out , ethernet was still working fine obviously ! ) This is an WONDERFUL deal for the price , especially with the rebate.EDIT : Been meaning to mention this for awhile.. I liked this particular switch so much that when we needed it , I bought another one of these for a different room , it works just as well . Both are still working flawlessly and I HIGHLY recommend this item if you are in need of an ethernet switch box !	1
The package arrives neatly packaged and properly secured . The packaging is easy to open and everything needed is included except for an ethernet cable , but you should have 1 or 2 of these laying around already.Installation is super easy , just plug in the power connector and plug in your in and out ethernet connections and you 're done.Construction is very solid and I can see this box lasting almost forever unless you drop it from a 20 story building .	1
What can I say ? It does what it should - It 's Netgear ! We have never had any problems with netgear products and for $ 8 who could pass this up ?	1
Seems to help the speed and visuals appear faster . No problems with it , would purchase again . Keep in mind this is a switch , not a modem .	1
Netgear products have always been my first choice in home interconnection . I 've found Netgear products to be reliable and full featured , quite frequently having more of the needed and hand features that their competitors offer.This device was needed to expand the port availability to my curent system to allow addition fo internet linkage for a newly installed solar array system to my house . The divice works well and meets my needs .	1
I 've always liked Netgear 's line of simple desktop hubs and switches . They 're small , simple , well-constructed , and they work , no fuss . This one and ones like it with more ports have been on the market for years , seemingly unchanged -- probably because they work as advertised for a good price.This one is no different . I 'm happy to see that they have replaced the old wall-wart linear power supplies with a more modern switching supply . This will waste less power , which is nice on something that will be plugged in basically all the time .	1
Hook up was a breeze , does what it is supposed to . I use the additional connection for my web based garage door openers . Can not comment if there is decay in data transfer .	1
Bought this to replace a Dynex switch I got at Best Buy for $ 32 . The Dynex was plastic and felt cheap . I love that this NetGear switch has a metal body . It feels like better construction overall , and at $ 12 less , it 's a great deal . All the ports work exactly as expected.My only complaint is that the power plug and the RJ45 jacks are on opposite sides of the switch . This may not matter to you , but for me it was slightly annoying because the switch sits in an entertainment center just like a DVD player or a set top box . It would be nice if all the cables came out of the same side so everything could be together , but it certainly is n't a deal breaker.I would definitely buy this again .	1
This solved my problem for needing additional ports . I was going to buy another router with additional ports but while researching the routers I found this switch . You just plug it in and instantly have more ports . Much cheaper than buying another router ! So far it has been great and I am sure I will never need more ports than this switch provides .	1
It does tend to bottleneck your internet connection so that is a point of concern if you work for a large company . I bought it since our office only has one computer internet outlet in the charting area and I needed to hook up a second computer .	1
More of a commodity purchase I bought not for a specific purchase , but more to grab and use when needed . Netgear makes great products and I 've never had problems with any of their switches . Be sure to note this is not a 10/100/1000 switch , but it is reflected in the price .	1
I have always liked the Netgear switches . Solid , reliable , and well priced . I needed something at the end of a long run to add another component vs. home-running another CAT5e cable back to the main switch . Works just fine . Auto-negotiates appropriately and no issues pegging it at 100Mbps throughput .	1
This is a good switch and works quite well . I like the fact that the Netgear switches are made of metal and not cheap plastic like almost everything else these days.Now regarding the rebates ... .it 's comical . You need to pre-submit your rebate through a company called prosaferebates and they are clueless on the current rebates going on with the Netgear Prosafe Switches , which means you ca n't pre-submit your rebate , and even if you could , you could n't check the status . If you enter the promo code for the current rebates ( 12-83226 ) you get `` 0 '' matches on the prosafe website . I even e-mailed them and sent them the current rebate form .pdf from Amazon and they claim the last rebate expired in January even though this new rebate offer runs from 4/1/12 - 6/30/12.If anyone knows an address where I can just send in the rebate without this pre-submit nonsense , please let me know .	1
Solid switch . Works with my llinux-based computer where one of those green switches did n't . I read that the power connector was short and would disconnect . I find no truth to that though I 'm not yanking on it all the time . Also , does n't feel hot at all which is something else that I 've read about this switch ,	1
I bought this to direct wire my NetFlix / Blu-Ray player . Ran the ethernet from the other side of the house , plugged it in and forgot about it . No issues to date	1
This product does exactly what I wanted it to do . I plugged in the ethernet cables and it worked great from there . Netgear is a great product .	1
I 've had this for almost a year now and it is still going strong . There 's not much to say about it : plug in your cables and go . Does n't require a whole lot of set up . It 's also low-profile and feels like solid make . Very happy with this purchase .	1
Easy set up , just connect power cord , plug all ethernet cable that you need for maxium 4 port , wait until all green light turn on , you are done , especially work for slingbox without firewall blocking	1
The switch has worked flawlessly since day one . The metal case is a nice touch as it is being used in a classroom environment -- the sturdier the better for me .	1
Nice competitive price . No problem at all installing or using it . It does exactly what it claims . Also , it 's very compact , sizewise .	1
I got this as a switch for the other end of the house and the kids ' video games and computers that were n't yet wireless . It worked like a champ . I was a former Linksys user , but have jumped ship and now use Netgear because of their reliability and support .	1
If you have much of a network in your home or office like me ( 14+ devices ) you probably need an extra switch here or there . I have one in my closet , one behind the television . and one behind the wall in the back room . I also carry one around in my computer bag just in case . Netgear makes good hardware . I would buy again in a heartbeat if I needed another .	1
I bought this keyboard a couple of weeks ago and I have no regrets . The hot keys are great for internet surfing and for listening to media files such as Winamp . I also plugged my Intellimouse Optical into the USB ports in the back and did not have to use a valuable USB port in the back of my machine . I would suggest this keyboard to anyone who likes the ergonomic feel and who spends a lot of time on the internet and listening to or watching media .	1
Originally I had rated this keyboard very well , but after using it for 18 months , I 'm gon na have to downgrade it to a HOLD . Its nice , but a minor mishap with soda totally ruined the feel . I took it apart , washed it throughly , and now the keys have a very stiff feel , and the space bar likes to miss half my strokes . I 've done the same thing to my older MS keyboards , and they all took the soda-washout treatment pretty well.And the thing is pretty heavy .	1
I went from a microsoft natural keyboard elite to a pro , and it 's a magnitude better . The elite was mushy , the keys just did n't have any bounce . The pro has more spring . It does n't have as much response as an IBM Model M keyboard , but this is so much better than the elite that it 's general feel is great.I hope microsoft brings a keyboard like this one back into full production soon .	1
This is a great keyboard , and my hands have felt better since the day I got it . However , I excpected it to be a USB keyboard , which it is not , and I thought the USB ports could support all devices , which it ca n't . The primary reason I own a keyboard is for typing , so I think that should be the focus . This is a great keyboard to type on , and I recomend it for that purpose . I also find the hotkeys extremely well placed , and choosen . They are very usefull . The USB functionality is only semi-useful ( hence the four stars ) . I could n't make all my devices work well on it , nor is it a USB keyboard ( it still needs the PS/2 port ) . Neither of these things were huge downfalls for me , but the were annoying , as it was not what I was excpecting . I do highly recommend this for typing , but if you absolutely need USB functionality , buy a USB hub .	1
I 've been a fan of the MS Natural Keyboards since they came out , working at Microsoft when they did , I made sure I had as many of them as I could . Turns out my hoarding was appropriate given their next offering , the Natural Keyboard Elite , was such a disappointment . So it was with great pleasure I found , after snapping one up on release day , that the third time 's a charm . First off , it retains the split design of its forebears which is so much easier on the wrists . The control buttons across the top are a nice addition , I use the media controls the most when playing songs in Winamp , and poke the larger email button to launch Outlook2k . The Internet browser controls are of less use if you have grown accustomed to navigation using regular keystrokes , they 're tougher to get to rather than just a quick F5 etc . The travel between key presses has been lessened , so you do n't have to push as far on , say , the ctrl button to activate it as you did in the first version . This tends to produce a little cushier typing experience but it 's worth it . They also returned the beloved inverted T arrow controls , instead of the horrid cross of the Elite . This design is preferable when playing games w/out joysticks or mice like a quick round of Mame32 emulated Pac-Man . Should also mention the presence of the two USB ports in the back for mouse/trackball use . The keyboard itself comes w/ a dual USB/PS/2 connector and is physically smaller than the original . Being on computers 10+ hours a day I have this keyboard and the Logitech Marble Trackman FX [ see review ] on all my machines , work and home . Highly recommended .	1
Let me first say I really like this keyboard . I have severe tendonitis , and it 's a lifesaver . Both the layout of the keys and the key action ( softer than normal ) contribute to the increased comfort.I am a & quot ; keyboard person & quot ; ( as opposed to being a mouse user ) , and I use the cursor ( arrow ) keys a lot . I tried to use the Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard , but found its diamond arrangement and smaller-than-normal cursor keys impossible to get used to . This keyboard has the keys in the traditional inverted-T layout . If you EVER use the cursor keys , spend the extra money for this Pro model instead of the Elite ! I also really appreciate the Intellitype software that comes with the keyboard . It used to drive me crazy to accidentally hit the Caps Lock key . With the Intellitype software , you can disable the Caps Lock entirely ( among many other customizations ) -- problem solved ! So why did n't I give this product 5 stars ? Two reasons : first , the function keys are smaller than normal . I would 've preferred them to be full size . Second , the hot keys are dark blue with icons molded into them . The problem is that the icons are not easily visible at a glance . It would 've been far better to paint the icons white for high contrast and easy legibility . As it is , it 's annoying that i have to scan the buttons to find the one I want . Good idea , poor execution.Still even with these minor flaws , I love this keyboard and heartily recommend it .	1
Not the greatest , but after a month it is still working great . I wish it had more than 1,5 and 10 minutes light time though , but for $ 12 you ca n't really go wrong ! I 'm running the 23watt GE CFLs and it all works flawlessly .	1
Its cheaper than buying a new light , and it works great ! have not had an issue . Has good range , and only works at night , it that is what you want .	1
My last Heath/Zenith sensor on newly installed light lasted about 2 years . I thought I would have to buy the whole unit , but glad they sell just the sensor.Box said it needs to be hooked up to a light switch , but I did n't . I do n't understand why that was needed.The original sensor came with a green ground wire ... this sensor does not . Not sure how that will affect anything since the fixture itself is grounded to the electrical system anyway.This sensor turns the light on Full bright RIGHT NOW . My original sensor ramped up the light over a second or two.No directions , so just pay attention ... white to white , black to black and red to red . Pretty strait forward .	1
This works great I wired it into the porch lights to turn on when someone is on the porch at night	1
Actually , I think they are better than the sensors ( I bought 2 ) that came with the lights . My original Zenith sensors became erratic after 5 years outside here in Colorado . Also those sensors were the & # 34 ; dual brite & # 34 ; type , a feature I never liked or used . This new sensor seems more solidly built - heavier and well sealed against weather . To replace the sensor I removed the entire light from the fixture box , unscrewed the sensor from the plate and cut the 3 color coded wires . Then I matched the colors of the new sensor to the wires I just cut , black - black , white - white and brown - red . My sensor came with a brown wire not a red wire as the match to the red wire of the light . I used simple insulated crimp connectors - available at any big box store , possibly even Wal-Mart.Then installation was the reverse of removal . Before you put the light back on the fixture box , align and aim the lights and sensor as best you can , its easier to do it at the work bench than up on a ladder . One small drawback , my lights are white and the sensor brown , so its a mismatch in color . I would have ordered a white , but did not see one offered . its does not bother me but someone concerned with exterior color matching might want a white sensor .	1
I replaced my old outside motion sensor with this . It fit perfectly where the old one was , works great and looks good .	1
I needed to extend a phone in my apartment without having to drill holes in the wall . So , I decided to purchased this 25ft cable which arrived promptly . Unlike others on the market that are flimsy , this one is of good quality and works just as advertised . I 'd definitely recommend it to my friends or anyone who 's looking for a phone extension .	1
Dymo is probably the only product i 'll ever use.The king of labels . You ca n't go wrong with the best.easy to load system , anyone can use it .	1
Black letters on white background are clear dense and sharp . Despite the the complaints of other reviewers , I have not had problems with print quality , sticking to smooth surfaces ( glass spice bottles , metal surfaces , etc ) . You ca n't beat the price with Amazon Prime , under $ 5.50 to your door in two days . Dymo has always been the gold standard in label machines since I was in elementary school in the early 1960s and we had the manual `` label embosser '' machine . Very pleased .	1
This was $ 2 more at Office Max ( with tax ) and I would have to spend $ in gas to get there . Got the same item for less and free delivery with Amazon Prime . I use these labels on everything , including kegs of homebrew beer . The labels stay on even if the keg sweats , but peel off when I need to refill the keg .	1
I really love the Dymo label and they are 1/2 the price as through local merchants . You get two for the price of one ! A++	1
Easy to use , fast , really trasnparent and the ink does n't smear or smudge in it . Easy to peel ( fold it in half )	1
I really ca n't live without my Letra-Tag ; I use it for absolutely everything . In addition , it is very affordable . it 's the greatest !	1
Great product . Worked great for my scrapbook project . Wish I could have afforded more . There needs to be a sale and less on the shipping .	1
I bought a ReplayTV before Christmas but found that my old TV and video did n't have the right connectors to go with it . The ReplayTV manual told me how I could work around this problem , but it looked like the workaround would give me poorer picture and sound quality , so I sadly decided to return the ReplayTV and wait until I get a new TV . If you own an ancient TV and video , think twice about trying out the Replay . And , if you 're about to buy a new TV , make sure you get one with s-video to ensure best performance with new gadgets like the Replay.Having said that , Amazon 's service was so good and its returns department so helpful , that it was no hassle to try the machine out and then return it . If you 're unsure about buying one , the 30-day return policy certainly makes it painless to check the system out . Even though I did n't get to use the Replay , I was impressed by the manual ( I 'm a documentation writer myself ) and the easy setup guide .	1
I ordered and received my 30 hour TIVO from Amazon.com last week . I have a home theatre system , with all components ( CD , DVD , Phono , Digital Cable Box , & amp ; VCR ) connected through a Yamaha top-of-the-line A/V receiver . As none of the example set-ups in the TIVO manual remotely matched mine , and despite the fact that normally I 'm pretty good at this type of thing , after about three hours of complete failure , I was positively stumped . I finally had to call TIVO 's customer care support . And this is where I am SO very impressed ! I was absolutely blown away when the TIVO representative stayed ON the phone for over an hour with me as I crawled behind my entertainment center with a flashlight and my cordless phone , with various cables in my teeth ! ; - ) She walked me through every step and with persistence and effort on both our parts , finally we got everything hooked up and & quot ; talking to & quot ; each other . I 've never experienced customer service like this before on anything I 've ever bought . Amazing ! And as for the TIVO and how it is working now - great and I love it ! Only thing I did n't like was the fact TIVO/Philips have truly overlooked the customer 's with home entertainment systems , calling a set up like mine , & quot ; advanced & quot ; - from what I can tell more and more consumers are going to the & quot ; advanced & quot ; systems so it would be good to see TIVO include hookup examples for & quot ; advanced & quot ; systems in their future product manuals .	1
TIVO is amazing . I am not much of a TV junkie but TIVO has me hooked . Like most people I put in a long day at the job . It is so nice to come home and actually have something I like to watch . I am a big Twilight Zone Fan . Most & quot ; Zones & quot ; air either in the middle of the night or during working hours . I set my TIVO up to give me a season pass to the program . When I come home after work there are always at least 2 episodes recorded for me to watch . The only problem that I have is that sometimes the audio does not match the video . It 's sort of like watching an old Godzilla movie . I have to go to the menu and restart the receiver to fix .	1
Honestly , I 'm pretty critical and particular about products . But I 've had my TiVo for over a year and have n't watched live TV since getting it . Why would I ? With TiVo , when I turn on my TV I can choose from among watching programs I know I want to watch . I can jump over commercials . I can instant replay something I 've missed . TiVo even learns what I like and suggests other programs I 'd probably enjoy ... all while keeping my data confidential.I 'm so keen on the product I 've given two as gifts . We 've had all sorts of gadgets in my home but NONE has taken over the way TiVo has . My daughters ( 7 and 11 ) and my wife are complete converts . The TiVo remote is the default for TV ; we 've stopped using our VCR . It 's a killer product.Next stop ? I 'm going to buy some TiVo stock ! Travis	1
The Philips TiVo HDR112 Personal TV Receiver was super easy to hook up and setup . It takes only 5 minutes to make all the necessary connections . It does require a 1-2 hour set up , which is mostly an automatic download of the channel line up and programming data.TiVo will completely change the way you watch TV . It really does learn your likes and dislikes and it will automatically suggest and record shows and movies that it thinks you will enjoy . Its really uncanny how it DOES pick shows and movies I enjoy . You 'll probably end up never flipping channels looking for something to watch or watch & quot ; live TV & quot ; ever again . Just make sure you go for the 30 hour model as the 15 will fill up very quickly.TiVo has been the best first generation product I have ever owned . Do n't be afraid to take the leap into Personal TV as it is really very easy to use and the recording quality is MUCH better than with VCRs .	1
I bought TIVO after seeing the infomercial on DirecTV.I had the satellite and cable subscriptions and was somewhat upset because I was always doing something when a program came on at its scheduled time.Now TIVO grabs the shows for me and I watch when it is convenient for me . This is a simple to use product . Perfect for someone who likes the VCR but hates buying and storing all those tapes.The user interface is easy to grasp.It is a little on the expensive side -- but my free time is valuable too - and this product gives me so much time back.You wo n't be unhappy that you bought this.Wayne Schulz	1
We 've been using this for over a year . It was an upgrade from a 10BaseT hub . The 100BaseTX feature was a significant improvement for home networking speed . We have three computers on it , one an always on FTP server and this device handles the traffic flawlessly.If you 're using Internet Connection Sharing with computers with mixed NICs ( some 10BaseT , some 100BaseT ) you might see very minor improvements in internet speed on the computers with 10/100 cards , but do n't expect this to increase your cable internet speed dramatically . Most of the cable networks are 10BaseT and only an upgrade to 100BaseT on their part would make a big difference . So when they say you 'll speed up your internet connection , do n't believe it ! We tried a more expensive one a few months ago that promised improved performance - thought it might be better at handling traffic and collisions - but it made no difference . Stick with cheap and reliable , and this one fits the bill .	1
Just to be clear , this is a switch and not a router ! Search online for the difference between a switch and a router to learn more . I wanted to share the internet access from my cable modem with my computer and my new internet capable blu-ray player . Well , I found out the hard way that this switch will not do the trick ! If you already have a ( wired or wireless ) router between your cable modem and your computer then you can use a switch like this to connect more computers . It just gives you more ports but it does not convert IP addresses to the outside world ( which is what you need when you want to access the internet from multiple network devices ) .I bought a router from Best Buy for $ 40 , but you can of course also buy them on Amazon . They are a little bit more expensive then a simple switch.Anyway , just wanted to let everyone know ! Otherwise I guess it works just fine !	1
Nice little box . It tucks away in the corner . I am using it to extend the ports on my DSL Router . The fact that it has an uplink port is helpful . No extra cable to buy .	1
I have a couple of these Linksys Switches alresdy . I needed a couple more and found the best price here . I use Linksys for all my network needs .	1
This product performs as described . I have no complaints . I bought it to use multiple computers from my internet connection using wired connections . So far it 's worked flawlessly .	1
Cisco bought Linksys a while back -- smart move ! Ca n't get any easier -- works great , while it is smaller than the Linksys router , it still sits nicely on top , although feet pattern does not match .	1
Plug-and-play with my existing network , which is comprised of 2-wire router , Netgear switch and this Linksys switch . They all play well together . I 'm happy with this purchase .	1
Awesome product - I ordered this because my 4 port router was more than full . Plugged the switch into the router then into the wall and it was done . Very easy , no setups , no firmwares , simple . One thing you should be aware of ( I 'm not going to rate the products itself less because of this ) is that the next generation models are out . It 's the same thing but they are considerably smaller than the previous version . Amazon should really update there picture . I have this stacked on top of my Linksys wireless router and it does fit but it does not lay in the four corners and previous linksys products . Not a big deal and still looks fine but just a heads up . 5 Stars	1
The Linksys 8 port workgroup switch was just what I was looking for.I used this product to wire our small library to 6 computers and wireless access . It works great .	1
An easy , reliable means to add Ethernet ports to the typical 4-port router/hub . Who ever thought 4 ports would be enough ? A whole lot easier than daisy-chaining routers !	1
A good quality network card for setting up a home network . I have 3 of these cards and have never had a problem with any of them . I also use the LinkSys 5-port switch to connect them all and share the Internet with my DSL modem . These network cards are rugged and reliable , and an exceptional value for the price !	1
I had no trouble installing this card in my Windows 2000 Server . I connected my Cable modem to it and success came quick and easy . It has been in use for several months without any problem . Great product , great price . I also have one of these in my Windows NT computer on this network - where it is also working fine . Cheers !	1
The money that I put down for my Palm Vx is some of the best I 've ever spent . Really.Prior to my Palm Vx , I had a separate address book and calendar and lists and notes everywhere , all of which ended up getting lost or being in entirely different places when I needed them most . As a result , I often forgot to do things that needed to be done , lost important phone numbers , etc.-you get the idea.My Palm Vx changed everything . Now I keep everything important , from the standard addresses , to do 's , notes , and appointments to my accounting info , stock portfolio , and local movie times ( thanks to AvantGo.com ) all on my Palm Vx , and it 's GREAT ! A warning to those buying Palm V 's , though . It takes time to get used to it ! I hated grafiti ( the & quot ; handwriting & quot ; you must use for the Palm to recognize your input ) at first , and found the miniscule on-screen keyboard a pain . Additionally , I saw no real point in keeping a to do list and ALL my appointments on the thing . After a month of forcing myself to do so , however , I was hooked ! After really taking the time to get familiar with the thing , I use it on the order of twenty times a day -- far more than I 've used any other device ( digital or old-fashioned pen and paper ) .So , my buying advice : buy one ! Palm Vx 's are absolutely fantastic , really ! They 're beautifully designed ( you wo n't feel geeky pulling one out ! ) and the handiest things in the world . I promise ! ( Be sure to buy a hard case to keep it nice . )	1
I bought the Palm Vx as my first Palm Pilot and it 's worth every cent I paid for it . It may not have as many features as the new ones , like a color screen , expansion slot , or Bluetooth compatibility , but it 's inexpensive and very reliable . It 's run downloaded applications smoothly and with no trouble . It 's got plenty of memory ( 8MB ) , a rechargeable battery , and is thin and light . It 's even better when you add accessories like the Palm Portable Keyboard or the Travel Charger . If you 're looking for a basic Palm Pilot for a surprisingly inexpensive price , this is for you .	1
I have recently bought a Palm Vx and I love it . Compared to my old way of keeping track of all my appointments and contacts it is a Godsend . It was easy to install the software and the hardware , taking no longer that 10 minutes . As for the Palm handheld itself it is very easy to use . If care to spend about hour playing with it you do n't even need the manual its all very straightforward . The HotSync worked great with my Microsoft Outlook . Another feature of the Vx is the rechargeable battery . Although this can be a great convenience , it can also be a hindrance . If you 're traveling you have to take a charger . This is the only shortfall that I see from this product . Furthermore I would highly recommend this to anyone .	1
The Palm Vx is really a standard-setter . Small footprint , great connectivity to the PC and to mail programs like Outlook . Many , many applications written for it , some shareware , some you can purchase . Easy synchronization via the cradle interface , which is also the recharging unit.Here are the pros : Small , lightweight , fits in a shirt pocket . Standard OS that is widely used . LOOOOOOOONG battery life . Plenty of memory for most text-based application . ( 8MB ) Plenty of peripherals like a sexy little keyboard , a combo ballpoint pen-stylus , travel adapter kits , car battery charger , IR exchange which works quite well.Cons : It 's fragile . Even in the brushed steel folding case I bought , the screen broke when it slipped from my hand . It 's Palm OS , which means it does n't have the advantages of the Pocket PC ( former Windows CE ) OS to run PowerPoint , ( there is a new program for the Pocket PC that lets you view and hear PowerPoint . ) It does n't have color display . The screen font could be clearer ( there are better ones on other PDA 's ) The telephone and wireless stuff is n't in it ( that 's either the Palm VII with built-in wireless or other brands . ) No MP3 player , no voice recorder . And the battery pack is not removable , although it lasts plenty long.Should you buy it ? If you want an organizer and email reader , this is excellent . It 's what I use every day . The long battery life is a real boon to the traveler . It packs a lot for the money . The optional accessories are priced too high , but this is a complaint against the industry in general . You buy the basic unit , but to add some useful doo-dads , you can rack a significant percentage of the purchase price in no time .	1
With less and less time to remember dates , times , and special occasions , the Palm Vx is a handy gadget . Has a whopping 8 MB of memory , which should be sufficient even with a ton of games ; ) Forgetting names , numbers , and addresses will be a fad of the past . There are tons of applications on the internet that you can download and use , which help save time and make this already handy tool even more useful . You can also 'beam ' files and your business card to other PDA users as well as laptop users via the Fast Infared Port which allows for wireless transfers . Great buy !	1
The time arrived for me to upgrade from my trusty old Palm V. I was running short on memory , so that left the Palm IIIc , Vx and Jornada 540 for consideration.I tried the IIIc for a month . Found the color screen a pleasure to work with . There are not that many 3rd party apps in color yet , but that appears to be changing fast . I liked the TinySheet Excel compatible spreadsheet in color . The black on white screen is very readable for e-books . Battery life was acceptable . On a 3 week business trip I had to recharge it only once . The downside for me is size , the comfort factor . You can NOT comfortably carry a Palm in a shirt pocket . I carry it in my pants pocket , with the V I would forget I had it until I needed it . The IIIc , it was just always 'there ' . The only other gripe I have is that it 's almost impossible to read the screen outside . Something I took for granted on the monochrome V. Bright daylight however fully washes out color screens . I REALLY like the small updates to the new PalmOS . Eg . the little shortcut bar that appears at the bottom of the screen for menu shortcuts is an excellent innovation . It makes cutting and pasting as fast as with the PC using the keyboard.I used the Jornada for 2 weeks before I returned it . As my expectations were n't that high from my previous exposure to the platform I ca n't say that I was dissappointed . However , I still do n't think MS is up to par . On the balance still more 'clicks ' are needed than on a Palm . I could n't find those easy to use 3rd party freeware apps such as the NY crossstreet finder , on PocketPC . On face value I liked Excel , but I found it 's small differences with the PC version annoying . Knowing one , I made assumption about the other that did n't always pan out . The high resolution of the screen is nice . For e-books the Jornada would be good , if not for the poor passive matrix screen . For example , on the plane , I could put the IIIc on the tray in front of me , and read at an angle . This is impossible with the Jornada screen . For basic PDA functions it is adequate . I feel the apps still are a bit sluggish . Playing MP3 's is fun , but with 2 songs at CD quality , memory is depleted which makes it impracticle for multimedia , unless you spend more to expand memory . Forget playing MP3 's in the background while doing other work , the device slows down to a crawl . Size wise , the Jornada is a bit bigger and heavier than the IIIc , which to me is a problem as I already explained . Battery life seemed shorter than the IIIc , though it may be subjective because it was on a lot , while learning the PocketPC platform.The Palm Vx is basically a faster Palm V with more memory . Just got it yesterday and I already love it . This is the one I 'm keeping . I suppose that after getting used to the size and weight of the Palm V , there is no going back . However , I 'm glad that I went through the hassles of trying out the other 2 models . I learned a few things:1 ) Size matters.2 ) Until technology for multimedia matures , color screens do not add significant value to justify their impact on size and battery life.3 ) PocketPC looked good on face value , but did n't go the distance , however , I do believe that as technology advances , multimedia such as MP3 playback will be great to have . I hope that by that time Palm will have the capability.4 ) 3rd party apps add tremendous value . Something I forgot until I could n't find my favourite little add-ons that make life easy , such as AccountManager , cross street finder etc.All in all , the best favor you can do yourself is getting one . Got my parents a Palm V 2 months ago , now I have to get them another one so they stop fighting over it .	1
I 've owned my Palm Vx for about a year and a half now . Despite the hype over much higher priced units , I still think it 's one of the best PDAs out there.What I Like 1 . Memory , and lots of it . If 8 Mb does not sound like a lot , think of what you 're using a PDA for . There 's plenty of room for the phone book and appointment book . That 's 80 % of what I use my Palm for . I 've never run out memory . 2 . Lots of freeware and cheap shareware add-ons . The most useful is the new Palm PDF Reader from Adobe . I can take important documents with me as a PDF and have them as a look up document . Other nifty utilities I 've picked up include a travel alarm clock with World Time Zones , IP Calculator and some neat games to pass the time . Coming on strong are text document readers and databases . 3 . Good monochrome display with adjustable contrast . Sure color on PDAs is a hot topic , but from what I 've seen , color is not worth it on a PDA . The color is poor and it really decreases battery life . 4 . Built in rechargabe power and long battery life . No hassle with batteries : drop it in the cradle and it recharges . I 've gone as long as three weeks without recharging.What I Do n't Like 1 . I had to add PocketMirror to synch with Outlook . When I upgraded my desktop , the Outlook synch was lost until I purchased a new PocketMirror . I have no gripe with the performance , I just wish this was a standard feature 2 . No expansion capability . I know I said it has enough memory , but I wish I could add an MP-3 player or use SmartMedia for archive storage . 3 . It looks so nice I have to watch out someone dose n't & quot ; adopt & quot ; mine ! PDA 's are what most people really need when they say they need a laptop . If you really do need portable spreadsheets or data bases and total e-mail management capabilities , you *do* need a laptop and no PDA is going to fulfill your needs . A PDA is a handy electronic version of the old standby appoinment book with some adapatability to other tasks . As for the current crop of hype topics : Wireless ? It 's a solution in search of a problem . Color ? Keep it on the big screen where it belongs .	1
I have had my Palm Vx since late 2001 . I am still using it today , February 2008 . I would love to now upgrade to a color Palm . However , I am very fearful that I will not find another PDA which offers the durability and longevity I 've received from my current Palm . I will continue to use my Palm Vx until it dies - permanently . There were times when I thought it had died , but discovered there was a button that was depressed and I did n't know it . That caused the battery to die and be unchargeable . Once I figured out the problem , I depressed the button , recharged the unit , and went back to business as usual . I love my Palm Vx ! ! Is there anything comparable ? If so , please email me at delecia1 @ cox.net	1
Very reasonable & reliable product . Does what it claims to do . Easy to use , switches very easily . Note that it converts composite video to svideo & vice versa . So you only need to make one video input connection ( svideo or composite video ) . Highly recommend to anyone looking for simple manual audio/video switch .	1
What can you really say about a CD case ? Well , for one thing , the price for these things have really come down over the years . I remember when a large capacity case such as this one used to cost up to 50 bucks ( ! ) , which , in my opinion , was way overpriced . I 'm glad to see that the price has dropped to a reasonable level . I like this case . It 's easy to retrieve and insert CDs from and back into the pages . The outside material feels better than the old- school faux leather . So , if you 're in the market for a case to store all your freshly ripped music and flicks , this is a good choice for the frugal shoppers .	1
This is a nice case for the money with loads of capacity .	1
I use this to store CDs and DVDs at my office and it has worked fine for me with no complaints for over 2 years now . Does what it is supposed to do .	1
I have had my 800 for about a year and like it very much . It 's easy to use ( and I agree with most of the comments below ) and takes good quality pix . ( Most of mine are flowers/birds . ) I use the NiMH rechargeable batteries - have two sets - and have no problems ; they last much longer than the NiCD ones . I use a Microtek reader connected to my Mac 's usb port ( and with an earlier Mac , used a card . ) My only big complaint is the lag time between seeing and taking the shot - often a problem with birds . Question : are any of the cards better/quicker than others ? I have a SanDisk . I am also thinking about upgrading to the 995 , but wish it used AA batteries .	1
I 'm just an amateur photographer but in the past 25 years I 've owned three 35mm SLR cameras and two auto-everything 35mm cameras . The Kodak DC290 is my first digital and it operates about the same as the auto-everything cameras . It ca n't do everything that an SLR and a gadget bag full of accessories can do and it does n't have the & quot ; feel & quot ; of an SLR . But , it does 99 % of what I want and produces beautiful photos . I 've had mine for about four months and have taken almost 1000 photos with it . Last week I went to the USAF Museum and took over 300 photos , about 100 of them with it on a tripod using shutter speeds of 0.5 to 3.0 seconds . Fantastic quality . I bought an extra compact flash card ( 64M ) and two extra sets of NiMH batteries and took along my old notebook PC . When the picture cards were full , I transferred the photos to the notebook PC using a PCMCIA adapter then erased the card . That worked fine and I have not had any problems transferring files to my home PC using the USB port either.When you consider that we were spending over $ 200 per year on film and developing anyway , going digital just made sense . I like the ergonomics of the camera and the menus are easy to use - just spend a few minutes with the manual . I was switching between a variety of modes at the museum to get the best photos possible and it was n't that difficult . I have n't had this much fun since I bought my first SLR . Coworkers were amazed by an 8x10 portrait of my wife that I took with the DC290 and printed on photo quality paper . Kodak provides support through their web page including OS upgrades to the camera 's software.Recommendations : Get a case and one or two extra sets of NiMH batteries . I have n't bought the AC adapter for it but I can see how it would be useful to some because it takes about 8 hours to recharge the batteries . The batteries will last longer if you use the viewfinder instead of the LCD . The LCD is essential for close up shots and the digital zoom only works with the LCD . A large compact flash card is a good idea if you intend to use the best quality at high resolution since the picture size in that format are usually around 500K . The graphics software that comes with the camera is OK but better programs are available for any serious photo editing you might want to do .	1
I used to buy the cheapest available cables for stereo connections . I found out over the years , that the sound quality was not real good , using the cheaper cables . That being said , my computer is on one side of the room , and my TV on the other . I thought I was going to make the connection with several shorter cables . This particular cable is 20 ft. long , and very well made . It fit my needs perfectly .	1
This product is highly recommended - I have bought several for multiple appliances .	1
I bought this to replace my cheap $ 2 strip , and I feel better protected when using it with my $ $ $ $ Photo Lighting system.I 'm sure the $ 2 strip would function just the same , but I used to sell Monster Cable back when the Good Guys was in business , and this stuff ALWAYS made a difference ! ! ! It does n't cost a little more just for the name ... .it costs more cause it Performs , and is Worth it ! ! !	1
It 's great to have the color-coding for each of your components , and I believe that Monster is a reliable brand . It may have been nice to have a coax connection to protect my sat receiver , but I am a bit dubious of the actual utility of coax connection surge suppressors . I suspect that , in general , surges are very rare or nonexistent from satellite dishes to the receivers , unless brought on by a lightening strike , in which case , any surge suppressor would be unlikely to withstand the strike . Because of this , I saw this particular power protector as the perfect solution for my needs .	1
A pimped out surge protector for the most expensive tech gear . Sure , it might be a bit overpriced , but you get what you pay for .	1
performing as described and I like it so far but I guess the real test is when there 's a power surge . I hopw that wo n't happen but it did , then I will edit the review if necessary	1
The two big selling points of this product for me was1 . Extra long cord length2 . Excellent Build QualityThe product came with outlets pre-labeled and some sticker ribbons for the user to attach to the cords themselves . These are helpful , except when you want to plug in something that is not audio / video related . ( Not really that big of an issue though ... haha . )	1
Just love the color code to know which plug to pull or to insert what where it belongs.Do n't have any complaints about this unit .	1
The AV600 looks like a pretty standard power strip with bright colors painted on to help you organize and categorize your connections . Stickers and cable guides come with the strip to help you organize.The strip seems to be well built , but I really ca n't say for sure whether it can live up to its claims . I guess only an independent testing lab could do that.As far as the rated protection level , you could probably find another power protector that has a higher rating for a similar price . However , my experience with the Monster branded products has been favorable , so I really bought this item based on the company reputation and past experience.One benefit of this power protector is that you can plug it in with the flat power connector and move your furniture ( if applicable ) close to the wall , unlike normal power strips where the plug sticks way out.If you have really high end equipment , or live in Florida as I do , I would recommending spending a little extra for more 'protection ' .	1
I like the color coding and labeling I just wish I could write in my own labels . Good product , would buy another one .	1
This product is very useful and when I could n't find anymore outlets , This has helped me in a variety of ways and now I have unlimited number of outlets .	1
I got a good deal on this . I did n't buy it because it was monster brand . I 'm not a Monster fanboi or anything . I just saw it go on sale and got a good deal and I needed one . I like the layout of the plugs . It gives you a good variety of spaces for transformers , etc . I have all my computer and stereo equipment plugged into it and it has n't missed a beat . Works for me !	1
I 've been literally moving my TV stand for years to unplug/plug in equipment . Well , frankly , my knees are getting too old for these floor-level shenanigans and we have a lot of lightning in our area . I bought this item so that I could shut down equipment and plug/unplug with ease . I particularly like the color coding for the different plugs , because that tangled spaghetti behind my TV stand is pretty hard to decipher.The shipping was fast , and packed well . I could not ask for more .	1
It actually replaced the exact same one I already had ... Reason being , my portable heater/fireplace kicked on while I had my stero surrond sound unit and my big screen T.V . on all at the same time . It surged and all units shut down immediately , and the surge protector set off an alarm ... Saved me about 8 grand ... Highly recommend this unit .	1
I was looking or a large capacity labelled surge protector and found it . Great price and quality and I will probably purchase another .	1
I was looking for an inexpensive surge protection unit that would safe guard my AV equipment . I was a little skeptical because of the price . This unit appears to be made well . I like its simplicity and it 's size . This is a recommended purchase .	1
Here 's the deal . I do n't know or understand much about surge protectors . I just know that when you but new electronics , you should buy a new surge protector suitable to the product you are buying .	1
all my surge protectors/outlets are all monster cable . quality brand . i do wish the length of the a/c cord could be a little longer . I think it 's about 4 feet long . They should make an extended a/c cord version like 10 feet or something . otherwise , stick with monster cable	1
I bought this as a precaution for my home office area where I have my home networking devices and laptop set up . Surge protectors are tricky to review because you never really know if it really works until you have a power surge BUT I can provide you a few things to keep in mind : PROS-1 . Protection : rated at about 1500 Joules . For those of you who are n't particularly computer saavy ( I admit I had to do some research on this ) the higher it is rated , the more it can take before it fails to protect . For 15 bucks , 1500 joules of protection is a steal . Will it protect your belongings from a lightning strike on your ungrounded home ? Probably not . Will it protect and prolong your devices from spikes and surges ? Absolutely.2 . Features & Functions : 8ft chord makes it adaptable and easy to locate an outlet for it . Ground indicator light makes me feel safe and secure ( I live in an older home while going to school and wiring is suspect ) . Protection light and auditory warning system nice touches to tell you if the unit needs replacing . Color coded outlets and included tags make it easy to identify wires . Coaxial a nice feature usually reserved for more expensive protectors and I have n't noticed any Internet speed decreases from using it.3 . Price : Mentioned before , but if you can get this unit for 15 bucks as I have , look no further.4 . Extra goodies : Includes a Monster coaxial cable ( if you are one of those people that HAS to have top of the line cables ) .CONS-Look : Purple and multicolored . This is purely a matter of opinion , but I prefer my other APC protector 's matte black finish . That being said , it is a surge protector , not a fashion statement.1 . Warranty : Do NOT be fooled by thinking just by purchasing you suddenly do not need homeowner 's insurance . Monster is a business and as such WILL try to find a way to screw you if they can . Nothing against Monster , but a business is a business . They will not honor their warranty claims without making you jump through some hoops first . Read some other reviews on here for horror stories . That being said , this is the truth with most companies in this business.Conclusion : Monster has n't developed a sterling rep for nothing . This is an awesome protector at a great price . In my opinion , they are second only to APC 's protectors . But when you factor in the price compared to the protection , you really ca n't go wrong with this protector . I know I have n't .	1
It 's okay for what I 'm using it for , probably would be great for most others . I purchased it to handle those ( transformer/plug ) devices that I have connected to my computer . I have two other similar types of strips and this one is probably the best of the bunch ( as being advertised as & # 34 ; made for transformer/plugs & # 34 ; ) . The problem is that there are many different size , shape and angle of the plugs . and depending on what you have you seldom can make use of all the outlets , there is just not enough space between outlets .	1
I use this for my home tv entertainment . It works well , and protect your asset . I refer people to buy it .	1
[ Since the following was written , the price difference between the Monster and Belkin ( both approx . 25 ) has become decisively gaping ( 20 and 35 ) , making the Belkin the only sane choice . } Monster is premium quality at a premium price . Musicians will pay more for a Monster patch cord than some folks would pay for an electric piano . But on closer inspection , this power strip is competitively priced . I recently purchased a 12-outlet Belkin strip at only several dollars below this Monster strip . But the Belkin would accommodate only 8 of my plugs because 6 of the receptacles are in a vertical row ( with the ground holes on the inside , not the outside as is the case with Monster ) . Consequently , a right-angle plug took up the space of 3 receptacles , in effect reducing me to the same number outlets as this Monster.Even so , why not save several bucks and get the Belkin ? Two compelling reasons in favor of the Monster ( the included HDMI cable is n't one of them ) : 1 . The color coding is a thoughtful timesaver/frustration eliminator ( how many times have you found yourself on the floor suddenly at a loss about which device connects to which receptacle ? ) 2 . The well-illuminated surface tells you at a glance whether the unit is connected and receiving power ( Belkin units have too few or zero lights , requiring the user to get down on all 4 's to determine whether the problem is a loss of power to the strip ) .I 'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because only 3 of the 8 outlets are dedicated to those space-robbing power adapters ( wall-warts ) . Count on the remaining 5 outlets accommodating no more than 2 additional power adapters .	1
This surge protector seems to have everything I need -- plus useful color-coding ( with matching cable labels ) . My neighborhood had power outages often , sometimes several times in one week . Until the power company figures out how to stop these chronic outages and surges , I need to protect my electronics and appliances.TiVo recommended I use a surge protector with built-in cable connection to protect my tv , TiVo , and dvd players from surges that can occur directly through the cable connection , not just through power outlets . It was easy to connect the incoming cable line to the Monster unit , then the outgoing cable to the TiVo box ( or your cable tv tuner box ) . ( I do n't know if there is a different product for satellite tv systems . ) This surge protector has 8 outlets , 3 of which are oversized for larger transistor-type plugs , plus the cable ports ( in/out ) . I did n't think I 'd like the colorful surge protector ( I 'd prefer other colors ) , but the color-coding turned out to be quite useful with all my home theater devices ' cords . There are labels that correspond with the outlet colors so you can wrap the appropriate label around the specific cord for fast match-up . Very happy !	1
I bought this surge protector following a storm that seemed to mess up my last protector . The Monster Cable protector works just fine and hase plenty of room for all of my PC and office plugs . The extra wide sockets come in very handy too .	1
Thought this would be enough for the entertainment system . It is working as expected now . easy to connect and use . I found the labels helpful against each power outlet..	1
As with most Monster products they are superior to the cheaper store bought power strips . Highly recommend .	1
I like this product , I have a few power strips for my entertainment and computer needs and I like this item	1
I have been plagued with very dirty power for years . After doing a great deal of research , as I would suggest anyone do before buying almost anything , I settled on The Monster MP HT800 . I 'm using it mainly for audio recording , Voice Over work to be exact , where a clean signal is a must . Hooked up my computer , mixing board and amp to this , and right away , the low frequency hum , I 've had to pad out , went away . Bought two now , and in the crowded urban environment of LA , I finally have clean sounding power . This is no hype , just the facts . I know some reviewers do n't notice a difference , well they probably have less noise to filter out . Hope the surge protection is as good as the filtering . Price was right on Amazon as well . I think I 'll get a third for the home theater .	1
I have never been one to keep up with the Jones so when this price was offered I snagged two of these.Always have power outages in Tucson and if I forget to turn off coffee pot during one I lose my coffee maker when power comes back on . That had me concerned about computer and TV set up . Have not had power out since getting these but it was wonderful to solve the problem of which cord was plugged in where .	1
A fine quality product from Monster . Nice to have the different options and the price was perfect . Great for all entertainment systems .	1
No problems to report . Sockets are easy to get to , and coaxial connection was a breeze . You spikes or shield problems to report . Cable cutter is happy .	1
Good quality low price power center with noise filter . This power center has good outlet spacing allowing for transformers to fit without covering outlets as some power centers have not incorporated this design causing loss of total number of available outlets .	1
This unit powers my 55 inch Panasonic Viiera HD set . We have lived through quite a few electrical storms with no issues . Good solution and a good price .	1
Excellent for any audio/video applications . I have an LCD TV , PS3 , Blu Ray player , cable box , and a receiver all plugged into this and it has given me no problems . The outlets are clearly labeled , it even has 2 outlets that have extra space between them so you can plug items that use transformers in without covering other outlets . It comes with a monster coax cable and a phone wire . Best of all is Monster Cable 's lifetime warranty and coverage of up to $ 250,000 if the power strip fails to protect your electronics .	1
sorry to see it disco ` ed by mfr ... Love the long cord ... hope they make a new model of this soon and will buy again	1
I gave this HT Power Center 5 stars based on the price . I did n't need a power center and only bought it for the `` power cleaning '' or `` noise filtering '' . I just finished upgrading my home theater ... TV , AVR , and new sub . I came across an article in a Crutchfield catalog that listed this item as a good economy power filter and their test data showed that it worked well . So , for $ 27 I figured why not . I have no way of measuring before and after so I have no idea if it did anything for me . But again , Crutchfield said it works .	1
I lost my previous RadioShack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the Queens power failure and wanted something dependable . The price is great for its rating and all the stuff included , and it is kind of cool-looking too ! Recommend without reservation .	1
Just built a new home theatre and used this surge protector . Does exactly what it advertises allowing multiple components to be installed at one source point and provides surge protection and insurance for a bargin price .	1
I needed an long power cable for a subwoofer , and I liked the flat-type power wall plug on this one ( could n't find it separate anywhere ) . I actually cut off the 'extension ' connector and attached an IEC C13 RIGHT ANGLE POWER CORD CONNECTOR ( also purchased on Amazon ) , to attach that to the sub . Love the cable . Very solid , thick and yet flexible . In my case , a perfect combination . Very happy .	1
The unit I received had a female plug on one end and a male on the other , but I just cut one end off and wired the male end into my old Marantz power amp . Results were very nice and looks impressive . Overall this cable is an excellent value as other powerline 100 cables were much more pricey .	1
I have good components , some of which do n't have HDMI . So , I needed high quality componenet video cables . I got these , and it is hard to imagine better performance -- even from HDMI . I run these cables from my DirecTV DVR to my AV Receiver . Another ( longer ) set runs from the Receiver to the wide-screen TV . The picture is sharp . I initially did n't get one of the connections pushed all the way onto the female end , and it did n't work . So , I pushed hard to get it on there , and it worked fine . These are tight ( that 's a good thing , since you do n't want loose connections ) . Just push hard to get them on good , and they will work great .	1
These cables are the bomb ! I could totaly tell a difference in the picture quality . If you want a good home theather system then ya got ta get these cables . You will love them like i do . It was coolBig Truck	1
My boyfriend and I had gone to Radio Shack to buy what we thought would be a good splitter for my satellite/VCR hookup with my TV . When we looked at what they had to offer my boyfriend figured then and there that it was n't going to work but we bought it anyway for $ [ ... ] , needless to say , he was right . It did n't work , not even a little bit . I searched on Amazon.com for the splitter I needed and due to the high recommendations I read on the site I ordered two of the Monster Cables and they 're working great . Since then when I go to any electronics store I have n't seen any splitters quite like these so I would highly recommend using the Monster Cable TGHZ-2RF ( Two Gigahertz Low-Loss RF Splitters For TV & Satellite 2-Way 2 Gigahertz ) especially for your satellite - you ca n't go wrong .	1
I needed a quality splitter for my digital cable and i could n't find anything of quality at the local shack.Anyway i found this splitter on Amazon and it does the job great.Picture quality on the outputs of the splitter is great.I 'd recommend this .	1
Previously Adelphia had setup my cable using two daisy chained 2 way splitters . This caused my HD signals to drop very frequently , especially on HBO . It was so bad that I could n't watch the HD feed at all . I was told that this would not solve my problem from a local high end A/V store , but they were dead wrong . Once I replaced the 2 splitters with 1 4-way splitter my signal was perfect . In fact , the reception on the analog stations also improved dramatically . To ensure the best signal I have also added other hardware : 1 Motorola Drop amp , 1 Monster 4 way loss loss splitter , then a Monster PowerCenter HTS 2100 with video filtering .	1
I needed to add and cable drop for my dock and I was worried about the drop in power to my cable modem . The monster work great . All the tvs are working and the cable modem is still fast .	1
After buying my MiniDisc player , I bought these little discs because they were cute and on clearance . They have yet to let me down . I can make CDs and listen to them in my MiniDisc player , my computers and my DVD player .	1
I 've read some reviews on these discs . They serve their purpose . The colors are cool , but need individual boxes . That way , they 'll be more compact . I 've seen my discs fall out of the flimsy dust free case.So far there are no problems with the discs themselves . It 's great that you can record about 1000X on them . At least if one breaks , it does n't cost a lot to replace them . They 're less than ... each.Actually , my discs say there 's 75 minutes of recording time . Well , I ca n't say much more . If you like Memorex products , get these cool little discs.Did my review help you ?	1
This is a quality product that holds up . I 've been using Viking products for a couple of years now ( modems , memory , etc.. ) and I have had no complaints about any of their products . Amazon 's price on this 32 mb card makes it a steal ! Do n't pass up on this great deal .	1
Not much to review ... if 32mb is all you need then this is the card for you .	1
First I bought a sandisk and after a month of use got damaged , I tryed to comunicate with them a lot , they have the worst customer service , then i gave up . then i bought this Viking like a year ago , and im still using it .	1
I ca n't say much for or against this card . It is not flashy or & quot ; USB Enabled & quot ; ( does anybody ever use that feature anyway ? ) but it does exactly what I expected it to , at a reasonable price .	1
I 've not seen a cheaper price , and I 've been looking in stores . This is a good value.Keep in mind , though , unlike the cheaper versions of this card , this card does NOT come with a flash reader . I was disappointed to find this out , but it was my own fault for just assuming it did . I still give it 5 stars . [ A note to HP Jornada 548 customers . This card works fine with the Jornada Pocket PC . I say this because it is not mentioned in the advertisement that the 128MB version is compatible , but it is . ] One nice thing about this card is that there is 24/7 tech support available if something should go wrong with it ( or with installation or whatever ) , but I do n't know what could really go wrong with it -- I guess that 's why they offer the tech support ! Anyone using MP3s should REALLY go for this card and skip the 64 MB card . The 64 MB card would be rather skimpy , and with 128 MB you 'll ALWAYS find things to store on it . ( I 've had my card three days now and I 've filled up 50 MB already , downloading songs , books , and maps ) .One nice thing about having a flash card for a PocketPC ( or other handheld ) is that you can back up your entire regular memory onto your flashcard easily , without having to worry about memory failure . That is pretty neat , kind of like a second hard drive for your computer ...	1
The 128 meg card by Viking provides the perfect balance of affordability and space . This card allows me to shoot over 400 1024x768 shots with my Canon Elph S110 . ( ... )	1
This card , including the rebate , is the best value for a 128 Mb card . I did not notice any differences between this card and my Kodak CF card in terms of speed of transfers , previewing pictures on the camera , or reading from a card reader.As noted , the rebate period is ridiculously short as you must submit within 15 days of the purchase date . If you get super saver shipping , you 're really cutting it close . I did not make the deadline since I put it off a few days .	1
This is a very good CF card , which also is fast . There exists some cheaper cards on the market but I know some of them are slower . Using the card in a high-resolution digital camera you do n't want a too slow card that will make you wait for the image to be stored before you can take next image.There is only one thing you need to consider before you buy this card : Is it big enough ?	1
I searched a really long time for a good solution for my Canon Powershot G1 . It takes microdrive , but when I asked around , I heard that they had some reliability problems . So I went with the largest memory I could buy . The camera itself came with 16Mb , and I have another 48Mb in cards from a previous digital - so altogether I can take over a thousand pictures at very high resolution . Now I need a Digital Wallet for those long trips without a laptop - perfect combo .	1
The Viking 128MB is cheap and works like it should -- I 've had no problems at all . I can take up to 300 pictures on one card with my Nikon Coolpix 995 but usually use higher resolution and get 150 pictures . I have two cards and they last for even long vacations ( plus , you can use the National Geographic approach when using this card -- take 300 pictures to get 30 good ones ! ) .Also , the rebate ( when it was offered ) worked just fine for me .	1
Easily installed in my PDA , this little chip lets me store hours ' worth of MP3s for portable listening.I can also use it in my digicam to store hundreds of photos at a time . Voila ! No more lugging a PC or PDA every time I plan to take pictures .	1
I really could n't have asked for more or better performance , and this seems to be the best price/Meg for most Flash memory products .	1
What can be said about a memory card . It works very well , this is my third , the oldest one is almost 3 years and working with no problems . An added bonus is it comes in a little plactic box which makes it safer for storage in the camera bag . The rabate makes it very inexpensive too ! I also have the Viking card reader for a laptop , was only $ 9 and makes transfering pictures to computer no effort at all !	1
Great bargain ! ! Easy to use and install . No problems . Great product ! My Jornada thanked me !	1
The compact flash cards are great and have a lifetime warranty on them . They are very tiny and slip in to your digital camera and PDAs . This latest one with 128 Mega Bytes is awesome and it works great with the Hewlett Packard C315 Camera . It stores over a 300 high quality images from your camera.However I believe that a lot of Olympus Digital Camera 's dont use the compact flash cards but instead use the SMART MEDIA card which is slightly bigger than the compact flash card . So make sure this card is for the right device.This card fits inside the digital printers that print photographs . Great Card , good speed , I 'd recommend it to anyone ... ... .and hey good price on it too ! !	1
I 've ordered three of these things . They work great . Never had any problems . They come with a nice plastic case that is perfect for storing the cards in my camera bag.Update : I think I own about six of these by now ( 12/2003 ) . Still , no problems .	1
This is the battery to buy for use in those applications where you want to & # 34 ; set it and forget it. & # 34 ; Or where you do n't want to be having to change batteries at inopportune moments ( like a digital camera ) . My particular use is for a indoor/outdoor digital thermometer . The outdoor sending unit is subjected to heat extremes and need to function even in subzero temps.These batteries will last several years there with no problem . Easily woth the extra money .	1
Bought these for their long life . I use them in my thermostat and CO2 detector . If there is a better battery out there , I 'd like to see it . To me , these are the best .	1
I have recently moved to the states , hence i used to get lost all the time , and it was a hassle for me to find my way back . This prompted me to invest some money into a gps system . Frankly the sole reason i chose this piece was the relative low price , however , i now think it was money well invested . There are however some cons to the gadget which one should keep in mind . First of all if you are driving alone then its kind of hard to keep an eye on the thing and drive as well . Also you should have a memory cartridge and the mapsource cd rom for fuller and detailed view of the area , the base map is not as good as it becomes once the map is downloaded off the cd rom ( which means more money gone into it ) . Most of its features are good , however , ` goto ` would mark a path which is a straight line and not always the best one . So overall i would say that its a good one , but beware of the additional investments .	1
I 'm a private pilot and was looking for a GPS with a map overlay to replace my old Magellan 2000.Love this little GPS , true , unlike an 'aviation ' GPS , you have to enter all the Lat-Long coordinates , manually for local airports , , , but what the heck , , does n't take that long to enter the info from your Airport Facillities Directory.I do n't really use it as a secondary or primary means of navigation , but I like to have it aboard because it serves as a nice cross-check to confirm that my other means of navigation are on the mark . Another cool thing that pilots will appreciate , is the ability to immediately know your groundspeed ( quickly accounting for headwind and tailwind components ) which you would normally need to tediously calculate times between waypoints on your E6B . It even gives you a running update on when you will reach your waypoints/destination . Love a handheld GPS when a tower ( at an airport that I am not familiar with ) asks me to report at 3 or 4 miles/whatever because I can give them a report call at exactly ( or nearly so ) the distance that they specify , rather than 'eyeball ' the distance and give an approximate guess ( important when there is no DME at/near the airport ) .Best part , is that it has most of the essential functions a private pilot would like , WITHOUT the high cost of some of those 'aviation ' handhelds.What I would recommend is to also buy a remote antenna ( Garmin Part # GA 27C ) it comes with 8 ft of cable and an antenna that mounts with a suction cup holder on any smooth surface . This is something that I am having to buy now . The GPS works fine without it , , , , it is just that having the antenna increases your placement options in your plane.Good Flights !	1
i-we- find this the best easiestbest priced gps out there.. about idiot proof.. we have hunters that get lost goin to the truck for beer.. not any more ... ..	1
Mainly interested in snowmobiling and off-roading in Lebanon , I would have given the Etrex a five stars rating ( which it deserves ) but it has two weak points that prevented me with doing so . First it has no software and no cable shipped with it.For the 12V cigarette lighter cable , the data cable and the software CD you 'll have to spare at least and addtitional USD 150 to get the most out of the Etrex . One of the strongest points are the features you get for a relatively low price , the great yellow shape ( no messy antenna ) and the autonomy on two alcaline batteries . Overall , the etrex is an impressive product . My next step is the Garmin Summit . And this goes to people from Garmin & quot ; You 've got yourself some additional brand loyalty & quot ; .	1
Nothing bad to say about it since it works just as what it 's suppose to .	1
These are full length ( 700 MB ) disks that are able to take advantage of today 's faster CD burners ( my 24X Yamaha burns a full one in & lt ; 3 mins ! ) . The price per disk ca n't be bettered , and the quality of the first 50 I got was 100 % perfection . Sweet !	1
I bought this 128mg card at Costco and I like it for the most part but when played in my mp3 player , I have some problems with the music flickering on and off once in a while which does not occur with my 64 and 32 meg card . But it really does n't bother me since I only paid 59.99 at Costco . Its a great deal considering this little piece of memory has like 2000 times more RAM than Apple II 's from the 80 's !	1
I finally ordered the SmartMedia ImageMate , even after reading some pretty horrific reviews ( and some very good ones ) . The SanDisk web page says to check the CDW EasyCreate , and mine was OK ( 3.5c , & quot ; c & quot ; makes it OK ) . Received the reader , installed the software , plugged it in to an empty USB port , stuck in a half-full SmartCard from my Olympus 360L camera , clicked on the & quot ; G & quot ; drive , and there it was - all of it ! Downloaded 40 images in 15-20 seconds ( not 20-30 minutes ! ) , played around with uploads , deletes , any old files ( not only images ) - WORKS LIKE MAGIC ! ( **FAST** magic ... ) I have Windows 98 , Pentium III at 733 MHz , a Costco USB splitter , 3 or 4 other USB devices , shut down & amp ; restart each day , and the system still crashes once a day or so . Pretty standard setup , I think . Good luck to all ! ! !	1
I like Logitech products and this was no disappointment . It worked well . Unfortunately I had trouble learning to move the marble with my thumb and ended up going back to my original marble with the marble in the middle . I am sure that younger unarthritic people will love the ease of use with this particular marble wheel mouse .	1
I was very skeptical of these headphones after reading reviews all over the internet . But based on price , it seemed like a risk worth taking . Have I ever been pleasantly surprised ! I use these primarily for working out . I have them hooked up to my mp3 player and then to the transmitter . I have the transmitter in the basement less than 10 feet from my workout area and have had zero problems . However , if I decide to go upstairs then I have issues with the walls , interference etc . But I knew that was going to happen since my cordless 900mhz phone did the same thing.The unit is SO portable it makes moving the transmitter a breeze . If I want to wear the headphones outside , I would move the transmitter to a better location , not leave it in the basement.For someone who want to use them while they work out and is willing to move the transmitter every once in a while based on where you are , then this is perfect . No more flailing wires on bouncing mp3 players while on the treadmill.Once tuned in , sound quality was great for me . If I 'm working out or doing yardwork all I want to be able to hear is the music to keep me going.Overall , just use common sense . If your cordless phone has issues in your house , then guess what , so will these 900mhz headphones .	1
I 've owned 6 Panasonic VCRs , each one better than its predecessor . I am not sure that the same holds for this one , though the price is certainly too good to pass on.If you 've owned a Panasonic VCR before then you expect reliability and ease of use . This unit delivers on that ... while including 4 heads , commercial skip , a lighted remote ( finally ! ) , and the entire bevy of features now standard on every VCR.The real negative is that it is much noiser than the model it replaces ; particularly when it is rewinding . We are talking a good bit noise , enough that it makes me want to turn up the TV volume while it is rewinding.I actually went out and purchased a JVC VCR to consider as an alternative , but returned that one and kept the Panasonic becaese the JVC was way too confusing to program.So why did I keep this one ? It is very inexpensive , I like the features , and I can live with the added noise . I think this one is a keeper unless the noise will drive you crazy .	1
I bought this drive for my G3 Macintosh . Had it installed , initialized and had everything transfered from the original 4 GB drive in about 45 minutes . ( Why Maxtor says you need a Windows clone is beyond me ; the drive works perfectly with the Apple driver and does n't have the limititation some early Windows versions have for paritiion sizes ) .The drive is quiet and fast . Everything I expected and more : the specs on the box looked like the specs for the ATA 100 model , even though it was supposed to be ATA 66 . Sure enough , the drive inside the box is the & quot ; H & quot ; model -- the ATA 100 version.I am completely satisfied , and will probably buy a second as a slave drive eventually .	1
I have had this exact drive for about a year now . ZERO problemsI am always adding deleting reformating everything . I have totally beat on this drive more than any computer user . It is almost like i tried to destroy it any way i could but there really is not destroying this drive . When i first got it i even dropped it on a marble floor . ( but i do n't recommend this if you can help it ) Did n't hurt it a bit . Maxtor is one company that has made a name for themselves by making dependable drives and they back it up with the product.As a added bonus the installation instructions were simnple and easy to understand for a computer geek or novice . That is something that is very unusual for any computer product .	1
After reading every review we could find , we ventured for the first time into the digital photographic world purchasing the Olympus 340-R digital camera last year . We were definitely not disappointed.The D-360L was the next step up from the D-340R . Then and today you can not find a better quality camera at this price , outside of the Olympus family . The 360 has all the same features of the 340-R , but adds capabilities to adjust white balance , and tinker with spot metering , ISO and exposure settings . It also adds a nifty little zoom function in the preview screen , as well as multiple flash and file compression settings.If you want additional zoom power you 'll have to step up to the D-460 zoom for about $ 100 more . It adds a 3x optical zoom to the 2x digital one and a higher quality preview screen . If you want to save more money and drop a few feautures try looking for a D-340R . They are still around at onine shops andit is a great camera on the cheap ! All three of the camera have the same lens , megapixel size etc.Our journey with the Olympus started just a few days owning the camera when it accompanied us to Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia and Seoul , S. Korea , while we nervously left our Canon SLR at home . The camera performed marvelously . We found the optional 16MB flash memory card more than adequate for our needs , as we easily downloaded photos each day into our laptop.We were amazed at the quality of photos even in low light settings . We took shots at our conference including a multimedia presentation where surprisingly the projected image on the screen was readable ! While staying in the countryside in a traditional Mongolian & quot ; ger & quot ; ( tent ) , we shot an incredible photo of the predawn sky -- even the morning stars are clearly distinguishable ! Arriving home we were completely satisfied with the photos shot at the low resolution setting when printed out on our HP Deskjet 895 using an Epson photographic paper . I doubt that most people would be able to tell the difference between the prints and a standard developed snapshot . The enclosed Olympus and Adobe software is easy to use and functional for most home use . You will absolutely love the Quickstitch utility that simply creates oversized and panorama shots ! One of the only weaknesses we found a little frustrating was the variance between the optical viewfinder and the digital one . If you frame ... say , a head and shoulders shot in the optical viewfinder , you will discover that digitally the camera sees a much broader area . Olympus should do a little better job calibrating the two viewfinders.Apart from that , you will want to invest in the NiMH charger and at least 8 batteries -- shop around for the best price . Also , picking up a 3.5 inch floppy adapter for the flash memory card will be a big time saver . You simply pull out the flash memory card , slip it into the adapter , and then slide the floppy into any computer . You 'll save time and frustration over having cords laying all around your table , plus a significant download time.One last item -- Do you think a 16MB memory card will be too small for your needs ? The 360 will use up to a 32MB smart media card , enough for 400+ shots at low resolution .	1
I 've had the D-360L for around 6 months now and overall , it 's functioned flawlessly . The pictures are crisp , with remarkable detail . I do have one critisism however , the battery life is appalling : ( This thing EATS batteries ! I have found that not using the LCD display helps a little though . All in all , a great little camera for a good price . Just make sure you have plenty of spare batteries with you on your trips ( or buys some rechargables ) .	1
The Olympus D460 is really awesome . I have owned a few of these types of cameras already , from the & quot ; early days & quot ; of digital photography and onward . This camera is really refined , they cleaned up alot of earlier mistakes and made the whole experience a pleasure . I very highly recommend digital photography and this camera in particular . Meanwhile , Yahoo has set up a service to upload these pictures and have them printed on photo paper . All in all , you ca n't miss .	1
I 've had this camera now for almost a full year . It was my replacement for the D600L from Olympus.Negatives : not many . My biggest pet peeve is the battery low indicator is not as accurate as I 'd like . The camera actually begins to lose functionality long before low battery is displayed . And the camera goes downhill very quickly . But the symptoms are more like the camera has lost some functionality and not others ( inability to zoom but still able to focus ) . I 've just become used to replacing the battteries as soon as I start having any strange issues.Its not as small as I 'd like . The D200L was a great size for a camera . This one is still too big for my liking . I 'd like to have something that really does fit in my pocket ( like the size of my cellular phone would be good.Positives : Get the 32Mb memory card and you can take photos for what seems like forever ! Superb low-light capability , good focus , excellent color , fantastic resolution .	1
I had a hard time deciding between the Olympus 3030 and the Nikon 990 . In the end , I choose the Olympus because of the option of sound on the movie feature . ( I bought the camera to take pictures of a new addition to the family . ) I really like how easy it is to take basic pictures . Family picture takers will like this camera . It takes great pictures , easy to transfer using USB , and comes bundled with great software . The camera is also very compact - its about the size of an average point and shoot.The only thing that I would change about the camera is making the menu system more accessible . It is relatively easy to use , but I have not mastered making quick changes yet . A great addition would be a quick menu system in the top LCD area instead of having to power up the monitor . Or a button to quickly shift between some saved modes . You will also need to read the manual in order to really understand some of the features . They are not that intuitive for a Nikon SLR user ... If you are buying this camera , you should also get extra memory and batteries . You should also invest in either an external memory reader or the AC Power Adapter . I have n't tried rechargeables yet , but that may be my next purchase .	1
After owning an Olympus 460 Zoom and now the Olympus C3030 , I would honestly say that the quality is pretty much the same . With both cameras , many indoor shots had be be & quot ; doctored & quot ; in Adobe Photoshop . Levels need to be adjusted and then the photos are just great . Outdoor shots are great . I did notice that battery life with the 3030 was considerably more than that of the 460 . Rechargeable batteries are essential with any digital camera ! I really like the & quot ; movie with sound & quot ; function of the 3030 . Smart media reader buyers - beware if you have an AMD processor . After much research I have found that a Pentium processor is essential and your reader may not work with an AMD . Camera appearance very professional looking . For the true photographer , this camera is a must . For the amateur the 460 works quite nicely .	1
I just bought this PDA used from Amazon and I 'm pretty pleased with it . It 's not color which I do n't care about , but I am having a bit of a hard time seeing the screen well . I have had a terrible time getting it to synch correctly with Outlook and I could n't get it to synch at all with Palm Desktop 3.5.3 . No clue what the problem is , but after 2 hours trying to figure it out , I just gave up . I use Outlook Express , not Outlook and it took a lot of trial and error , but I can get it to synch names and addresses , but I can NOT get email to work since i do n't use Outlook as my default mail handler . So..if that fits your situation and you want to synch for email and download from AVantgo , then do not buy this . However , I just want it for names and addresses to replace an old trusty Sharp Wizard that they do n't make anymore . I really loved my Sharp though . What i like about the Palm IIIxe is that it 's battery-operated ( 2 AAAs ) - i honestly do n't even fathom why people complain about this feature - they 're nuts . The battery operated PDAs are the way to go because they can last forever in your purse and you do n't have to remember to charge it . If the battery is dead while you 're on the go - just run to a convenience store and buy AAAs . That simple . The Palm IIIxe seems pretty sturdy , but we 'll see in the long run . Either with Palm or Sharp , this beats carrying around a paper and pencil organizer . The person I bought from on Amazon was great and honest too .	1
I recently purchased my first palm and almost immediately had to replace it . I could talk a lot about the wonderful features and conveniences the replacement palm has added to my life , but I want to talk about my great experience with Palm 's customer service department . The other Amazon reviewers can talk about how wonderful it is to own a palm pilot.The first palm I purchased had something seriously wrong with it . I was getting numerous error messages and system failures that required that I repeatedly reset my palm , losing my data and everything . Ugh . I called Palm and they walked me through a thorough series of tests to try and fix it . My call was handled quickly and efficiently , but with patience and concern on the part of the service representative . The end result was that I had a defective pilot , and they replaced it no questions asked . I was not happy that I had a defective product at first , but with electronics that is unavoidable once in a while . My new palm is humming along perfectly !	1
There it was under the Christmas tree , my very own Palm Pilot ! Santa had taken advantage of the wildly popular $ 50 rebate/amazon coupon combo ! Having owned the Palm for a few weeks now , I thought that I 'd write a review , from one first time Palm owner to those who might be considering it . First and foremost , it 's FUN . It 's just a nifty little toy that comes in extremely handy on a daily basis . Secondly , it 's _really_ easy to use . I kept reading the word & quot ; intuitive & quot ; in reviews when I was shopping around , and that 's definitely true . I was thinking about getting a Visor because of the Springboard capabilities , but I decided , as another reviewer , that it 'd be better to , say , buy a seperate MP3 player , of better quality no doubt , if I ever felt the strong urge for one , rather than add on to my PDA . The Palm IIIxe 's large memory really does increase your possibilities for use , if you 're a little proactive and sniff around on the web for some neat third party software . I 've got AvantGo on mine , which is a must . News , weather , movies , stocks , you name it , updated every time you HotSync with your desktop when it 's online . I live in a large city , so I also got Vindigo , which is a great little program that lets you search for restaurants , movies , stores , and the like close to your location . I recommend their web site -- they have a demo that 's just like the real thing . I also got CSpotRun , a free doc reader that I use to read ebooks . There 's a lot of free ones out there -- mostly older works that are n't copyrighted . I also have a city map from Mapopolis , and some games , of course , to pass the time . As far as the stuff that 's included in the Palm , it 's all pretty self explanatory . It 's great to not have phone numbers on the backs of envelopes scattered around the house any more . Graffiti , the handwriting software that Palms use , is extremely easy to learn , and there 's stickies included with the characters to stick inside your case should you forget something . It 's obviously not as fast as typing , though , so the ability to type stuff in at your computer and then HotSync it to the Palm is very helpful . The infrared beaming is a neat little feature -- my boyfriend also has a Palm so we 've beamed one another shopping lists , etc . Soooo , I 've only owned the product for a few weeks , so I have n't encountered any long term problems yet , should they arise , but overall I 'm extremely pleased . It 's fun , it 's compact , it 's easy to use , it 's helpful , it 's a way to get organized from addresses to shopping lists to to do lists . I like my Palm . So sue me .	1
I 've been using a Palm IIIx for a year now , and yes , it 's a brilliant device- but it 's not for everyone . Should you buy one ? Yes , if:1 . You 're already an organized person . If you 're the type who uses a datebook or calendar , who answers their e-mail immediately and who keeps up to date to-do lists , you 'll find the Palm a godsend . You 'll find yourself whipping out the Palm during meetings to answer your e-mail , making notes for grocery shopping and jotting down telephone numbers and addresses.2 . You 're a gamer or technofreak . You'lllove the variety of software for the Palm . You 'll be playing SimCity ( yes , there 's a Palm version ! ) , chess , Galaxian and programming in FORTH , C and various Palm-specific interpreters.3 . You 're a hardware hacker . The Palm is a great interface for all sorts of experimentation.But if you buy the Palm thinking it 'll make you organized ... nope , wo n't happen . Save your money .	1
It is a great feeling to carry around your palm and always have information in your pocket . I use mine with avantgo.com to always have something to read . I load a few ebooks on . I also have it linked to my Micorsoft Money applications so I can always keep track of my finances . How great are these things ! Pick one up !	1
Mine is older than dirt , now serving as a backup . It has proven itself to be reliable , sturdy ( except for the flip-open cover ) and easy to use . Of course , the software available is incredibly diverse , making this a very useful tool in business , travel and entertainment ( egs . financial spreadsheets , airline schedules , 100s of games ) . I get months out of 2 AAA batteries , even with frequent use of the easy to read backlighting for the screen . I would say that you can not go wrong with the PalmIII , though the price makes other brands/models worth considering too .	1
The inventor 's of the Palm Portable Keyboard have have developed an incredible accessory to the Palm PDA Platform . You have got to see it and try it out to appreciate its marvel . It literally is a full size keyboard that folds up and is only slightly larger then the Palm PDA itself . It even comes in a nice carrying case . Inputing information into your Palm is a snap and I really appreciate not having to write , using the grafiti tool to add information into my Palm . If you use the Memo feature on your palm to jot down some notes , type a lengthy memo , etc. , this this keyboard is for you . Typing is a breeze and feels very natural as if you were typing at your PC . There are specific keys on the board that replace the need to tap on a menu item to be called up . I can not emphasize the portability and light weight of the keyboard and the uniqueness of how it folds up into compact size . If you are a regular user of your Palm PDA then this keyboard is a must . You will not regret spending the extra bucks in lieu of convenience .	1
I do n't see any need to repeat at length what the other positive reviewers have said -- I agree totally that this incredible folding keyboard A ) unfolds into a *full-size* keyboard with most keys the exact same size as those of your desktop keyboard , B ) folds up into a size no bigger than the Palm itself , and C ) works cleanly and smoothly with Palm programs as well as third-party add-on software ( a definite plus in today 's age where adding a peripheral to your computer often means hours spend hooking it up and fiddling with installation programs ) . What I *will* add that no one yet seems to have commented on yet is the ultimate COOLNESS factor ... take this keyboard out , pop it open , and I guarantee your tech-head friends will be oohing and ahhing over its elegant and innovative design , compact size , and sleek shape ... and when they see it *work* as smoothly and easily as it does , they 'll want one too ! ADMIT it , after all ... is n't that at least ONE of the reasons you got a Palm ... because it *looks* cool ? Like the Palm , this looks cool , works great , and after a week you 'll wonder how you ever did without it . ( One addition not mentioned in the other reviews : do n't expect to use this sitting on your lap , as the keyboard folds up in the middle . You have to set it down on a table . )	1
This thing is SMALL , folded . It is an accordian of four parts . It comes with a polyester zippered case , reminding me of scuba diving skins.Slide one catch , and it unfolds . Slide two sliders on either side in , and you have a just about full size keyboard . Key feel is pretty good , does not feel cheap . It 's construction looks well made , not cheesy . You fold out a little shelf on top for the Palm computer device . The Palm is offset to the left a little on the Palm III keyboard model . Can be a bit confusing at first ... not much though , just watch where you initially place your fingers for touch typing . When done , slide the little shelf back in , slide out two slides on either side of the keys , and fold up the keyboard . To a size a little wider than the Palm computer and about 1 & quot ; thick or so . Very handy.Not much more you can say about it . It 's a keyboard ! The manual comes with good instructions . I wish it came with a small card with a list of special keystrokes for it . But I can make one of those.Nice !	1
When PalmPilots were the rage , this folding keyboard was cool . It was designed well and worked flawlessly . Only it came out just when PalmPilots were about to disappear from visible use . Looking back at it , there was some irony in using a full keyboard like this just to create long documents in the device that could then be loaded at a later time to a PC and sent in an email . At the same time , it was easier than carrying around a laptop . Looking back at the intended use , one did n't expect to be able always to send a document immediately as has long ago become the norm .	1
I have several DVD players and the picture quality and sound on the DV-F727 is very good . The lack of usability actually comes with loading and maintaining the disc inventory.It is NOT STATE OF THE ART , that for the TITLE as well as for ONE ARTIST there are just 12 characters , despite the GUI interface and the mouse and keyboard . I do like this product , but it obviously never went through some USABILITY testing . I can only hope that there will be some software upgrade available . I seriously recommend the product , but be aware that the nice part - the disc database is MORE THAN LIMITED .	1
I 've owned the Pioneer DV-F727 for at least 6 years and have been VERY pleased . I still remember the first Universal movie we fired up . It had the new ( well , new then ) logo rotating into view around the Earth . With a component video hookup it looked so good it almost passed for 3-D . It still looks as good today.Frankly , I 'm surprised to see this model still for sale considering how quickly most electronics come and go . I suppose that says something about it , too . To be balanced , there is a small gripe . Only 12 characters can be entered for each disk title . I suppose it 's limited by what can fit on the front display . It helps that there 's also an artist field . It does n't display on the front but does appear on screen when display is pressed on the remote . Oh , and the remote is n't backlit.The very minor gripes certainly do n't amount to more than a small fraction of a star rating . Therefore , I still rate it as a solid 5 stars .	1
Love the fact that the changer can store up to 300 compact discs . I am currently a third of the way there . MostlyI play it on random mode . Recently random mode does not work as well as it did compared to when I first got it.The player is telling me `` no disc '' when I know I have a disc in the slot . If someone out there can help me , pleaselet me know .	1
I 've had a previous model , the Pioneer PD-F1007 , also a 301 disc player ( this comment is for the PD-F1009 ) , since January 2000 , and it 's never let me down far as I can recall . I chose it over a Sony 300 disc player at the time , the deciding factor being that the Pioneer supports the time remaining feature on the playing track , when selected , whereas the Sony player did not support the feature . I think it was a handsomer unit , in addition , the LCDs being yellowish rather than the glaring hot white of the Sony . I paid about the same as this newer model sells for now.I never use random play , so ca n't speak to the complaints here about it.This player supports CD Text and that was an important factor in my decision to buy . More and more CDs support that now , and I 've always burned CDRs using that feature , inputting the data ( including track titles ) when the original disc does n't include it . It 's a crucial feature in my opinion.There are search functions , but I rarely use them . Instead , I have a database of recordings I 've inserted into the player from which I print reports . So , I can find what I 'm looking for in a snap , entering the slot number on the remote.Speaking of the remote , well , my eyes are n't so good . Early on I made adjustments to the remote , cutting out sticky dots , arrows , pointers , numbers , pieces of yellow tape , what have you and affixing them to the remote , sometimes with clear plastic tape . I never mess with that stuff now , but it 's all there and it helps me find the functions I use most very quickly . I was kind of lost without them . It would just be a mass of black buttons to me without them.The only lacking features that come to mind are:1 . The inability to control headphone volume from the remote.2 . The to me inconceivable necessity to delete CD text for a slot whose CD Text supporting disc has been removed from the player . Put a different disc in the player in that slot , and if it does not support CD Text , the player believes that the newly inserted disc has the text of the previous disc , which is bonkers . Well , it only takes a 1/2 minute to manually delete the info for that slot from the memory of the player using the remote , tapping the keys , but it should n't be necessary .	1
I had a Sony 200 disc unit a few years back that dropped disks often . I read the reviews and determined that the problem still exists , so I opted for this Pioneer unit . I have had it running 3 months now and have not has any problems . Audio quality is average thru the RCA cable . Ya got ta get the optical cable for premium sound . You might consider an upgrade to play MP3 's or DVD 's - I saw no need for those features , considering the added cost . I highly recommend this CD unit ! A great buy !	1
I have a 950 , a 990 and a 995 . They are all great cameras . The 995 has a 4:1 zoom , and a few other improvements , but this one is a bit smaller - I like it as well . You have more control with these Nikons than any other . And the swivel design makes it possible to take shots in situations you could n't with any other camera , even IMHO the newer LCD designs like the CP5000 or Canons . This is a great camera , it takes great pictures , and the accessory lenses make it an excellent system .	1
You can not beat this case . I have it to hold my Palm IIIxe . The case is made out of the same material that wet suits are made out of . The case is totally shock proof , and splash proof . If you do not yet own a case for your Palm organizer , then this is definately the one to get . Ca n't beat the price either .	1
It 's just great . It 's waterproof , good design and shock resistant . My only comments are that it should have a belt clip . That would be nice . I like how it has room for other stuff . I keep my Grafiti reference card in the pocket so that I can reference when needed .	1
Browsing through my old orders today and saw this mouse . I got this in 2001 and have used it almost all of this time . Works as well today as when new . I have gone through at least a dozen mice roller balls and track pads on various computers but this one is always with my main computer ( been through more than a few computers also ) . Highly recommended .	1
This is without a doubt one of the best and most innovative products I have owned in a while . Most would look at the price tag and immediately choose an old fashioned cheap mouse with a ball inside . One thing to keep in mind is that the mouse is one of the most important devices you use , except for perhaps the keyboard . Anybody who has a computer knows that after a few months or even weeks , traditional mice begin to stick when you try to scroll . This is because lint and dust build up on the inside and prevent the ball from rolling smoothly . With the optical mouse , there is not ball . As a matter of fact , there are no moving parts to get clogged up . In addition , this mouse includes 2 buttons on the sides , which are customizable . I use them for going forward and back on the internet . A scroll wheel is also included , allowing you to easily and conveniently go up and down in documents and on the internet just by spinning it . Any computer user will appreciate the precision of the mouse , and the fact that it does not require any cleaning or maintenance . Gamers especially will appreciate the precision , although it may take a little getting used to because even when the mouse is less than an inch above a surface , it can still function . Once you get the hang of using it , you will never want to use a traditional mouse again . Throw away your ball mouse . It is time to see the light .	1
At 50 yards with color-changing targets , these get the job done . But anything beyond 50 yards , you are going to want something with higher power . Otherwise good value , and solid construction .	1
I bought these for my son , who just turned 11 . He wanted a real , working set of binoculars , but I did n't want to spend much money in case this is a passing fancy . These binoculars fit the bill , so I purchased them.They arrived in a frustrating clamshell . Beyond that , though , I could n't ask for a better set for my money . It took him only minutes to figure out how they work , and he had the carrying case strapped to his belt almost immediately.We took them to our local Wild Animal Safari drive-through , and he kept the neck strap around his neck so that he could view the more distant birds and animals.He is thrilled with them , and I am thrilled . For the money , they are a decent pair to work with .	1
I bought these binoculars as a companion to the opera . I used them yesterday for the first time , and I must say these do the job just great . The size is very small , so you can put them in a small purse , and the touch and design of them are very delicate . I was sharing them throughout the whole performance , and I did not have any problem at all with the focus ; they were in focus all the time . I did not know much about binoculars , so I did some research online before buying . I found out Bushnell was a very reliable brand , and the price of these on Amazon is just great ( $ 19.99 while I am writing this review ) . I wear glasses , so I have to take them off to use them properly ; but that is just fine with me . My seats at the opera this year are among the worst , because I wanted to see the whole season for a cheaper price , so I needed to make sure I got binoculars . I am completely satisfied with these , and I do not need any fancier or more expensive ones .	1
We needed a pair of small binoculars for shows and other events . These appear to be decent . Good magnification with minimum distortion.While there are models with more magnification you have to keep in mind that with higher magnification comes more problems with distortion when you ca n't hold the binoculars steady . This model is a very goo compromise.Comes with a reasonable storage case and appears to be well constructed .	1
Small and compact for our trip to Costa Rica . Really enjoyed bird watching with these .	1
The lens are clear and the knobs easy to adjust for focusing . You can easily adjust the view to be sharp and bright . It also feels rock solid and firm . This is simply value for money !	1
We were looking to upgrade from a less powerful binocular for bird watching . My wife did not want a heavy , cumbersome pair ( if binoculars can be considered a pair ) hanging round her neck since she is the primary user . They are light , more powerful and can be stowed in the glovebox for ready access . Got what I asked for .	1
I bought these binoculars to carry in my range bag . For that purpose , they 're ideal . They 're compact , sturdy , have a decent ( soft ) protective case , and I have no problem seeing my targets . The exterior has a durable , rubberized coating , so I expect these glasses to be a longtime traveling companion . Highly recommended for the money !	1
You ca n't go wrong with these binoculars if you are looking for a set to use at sporting events or concerts . They almost fit in your pocket , and are of good quality . Obviously at this price point , the optics are not exactly world class , but that 's OK . They serve their intended purpose very well , at at this price if they become damaged or lost , your cost to replace is small .	1
I got the 16x32 version of these binoculars for bird watching and wow are they powerful . And you ca n't beat the value of $ 40 for a compact , powerful binocular . I was using a much cheaper brand which would not focus that well . But the optics on these Bushnell 's are so much better . Highly recommended for bird watching !	1
Nice pair of binoculars for the money . They have a good grip to them and let in a good amount of light . Also , pretty powerful for how compact they are . Wish they had an adjustable power setting but you ca n't expect that on compacts .	1
These Binoculars are great for average users . Well worth the price . They are powerful enough to give you good close-up views that usually require much bulkier and heavier binoculars . They are compact enough to make them very portable and come with a nice soft storage case that can be attached to your belt . The focus works well for me but you do have to have a pretty steady hand to see clearly . I sometimes lean on things if necessary . They can fog up in High Humidity conditions ( like most others do ) . I think you have to pay much more and get larger ones to get past these issues . Overall , good quality for the price compared to others on the market .	1
it 's a $ 20 pair of binoculars complete with a carrying case . How can you possibly lose ? Great deal for the price .	1
I was debating between these or theTasco Essentials 8x21 Binocular ( Black ) seeing as the specs were almost identical . I got both . This could very well be a Copy-and-Paste of my Tasco review , but that would be very redundant . The differences are:1 . The Tascos feel more sturdy . There 's not a durability problem with the Bushnell , but the Tasco just feel more solid.2 . The Tascos have a longer span of adjustment , in both the center focus and the diopter . The Bushnell 's focus is just fine for me , but it 's nice to know that the Tasco can adjust to a wider range of eye types.3 . The carrying case feels more durable with the Bushnell . Both cases close with a Velcro strip , but the Bushnell 's are made with a more sturdy material . Both will attach to a belt , but the Bushnell 's stitching is better.Both binoculars come with a lens cleaning cloth , and it seems the same for both ( except the color ) . Typical size and quality of low-price optics , but they do the job . Both binos have the same neck strap , which is rounded and will prevent them from falling off your neck . Just do n't use the strap for steadying the binos ( do n't pull the binoculars forward while the strap is around your neck to keep them steady ) because you 'll probably snap the cord . Both have rubber armoring , which is better than nothing , but nothing to really brag about . Both have fold-down rubber cups for eyeglass use ; again , nothing to write a lot about.In summary , they 're both great optics for under $ 15 . There 's a one dollar difference , but I prefer the Tascos . I 'd give this a 3.5 star if I could , same as the Tascos , but it 's hard to beat either set for the price.EDIT : After being stored in its pouch in a rucksack for almost four months , the eyepiece with the diopter ( the right eye piece ) came off . It can be superglued back on , but you have to be careful that you do n't glue the diopter in one place .	1
I am extremely satisfied with these binoculars after purchasing them from Walmart . I use them to view a variety of things from a distance , including wildlife and signs . The optics are very clear and the field of view is quite wide . All of the adjustments feel smooth and well-made . While shaking can be a problem when reading something from a distance , it is not the fault of this particular model . They fold up into a very compact shape , which fits in a canvas case . When placed in my jacket pocket , I hardly notice their presence , they are so light.Definitely good for bird identification . Enthusiasts could even carry these around wherever they go .	1
I purchased these very lightweight binoculars for one of my grandsons at the recommendation of one of his uncles who owns the same pair . My grandson wants to use them to look at birds and wildlife . They are powerful , but the nicest factor is that they are so lightweight when hanging around your neck . No one wants a dead weight ! The case is very lightweight which is all that we wanted , so if you want something more substantial you might want to purchase a different case , for example an inexpensive camera case . The case does n't detract enough from the quality of the binoculars to warrant a lower star level .	1
Nice clear optics and quick/even adjusting . Lightweight and GREAT for birding . LOVE them ! ONLY issue is they are MADE IN CHINA I would have bought one for each of my family members ( 10+ ) IF they were American made .	1
I bought this product three years ago . It is a high quality product that works well , for a very reasonable price . I bebated between this 12x25 higher magnification and a lower power Bushnell . The issue was a smaller view with higher mag and more optical leverage and shake than the lower power.This higher power binocular was not too much magnification . In fact , a lesser power would be too weak . This unit has the needed power to really get a closeup view . I would think the lower mag would disapoint most people .	1
I bought them for a concert I was attending , they worked pretty good , I was impressed that I could still see pretty clear at the distance I was . Now I use them for birdwatch at my backyard and I like them a lot . I can see very clearly at the birds . I recommend them 100 % .	1
I purchased these because I do n't like taking my $ 100 binoculars to football games and rock concerts . These are perfect . The optics are a little cheap , but at $ 20 , I think it 's a steal .	1
These are a nice pair of binoculars , lightweight , comfortable in your hands , but I found them hard to get a clear , steady image thru.I realize now , after the fact , that they were not the best choice for my application.I was looking for a smaller , lightweight pair of binoculars for my mother to use for back yard bird watching . These were a little too powerfull for my mother to handle and , for her , the 16x magnification meant they were hard to keep steady without a tripod of some sort.I utlimately went with the Bushnell Natureview 8x40 binoculars . True it 's only half the magnification but , in this case for what I needed , less was much better .	1
These binoculars are everything I had imagined . I do n't know the advanced features on higher-end binoculars , but these are small and perfect for simple tasks . I can use them without my glasses , as they have the main focus and the diopter adjustment in the right eye.They just barely stretch wide enough for my big head , so some heads might not fit . I can use them to see the buildings and activity on the opposite side of the bay , and they also bring distant wildlife into view . Next , I need an image-stabilized , 12x zoom camcorder for better viewing and capture of the sights I 'm seeing , but that 's going to be 50 times as expensive !	1
We had a bushnell that finally wore out after twenty years , and tech out paced it . I bought a pair of glasses from another vendor , and these . This is a superior set . Easy to adjust , powerful , in fact too powerful for our backyard feeders , we use the compact pair for the yard , and save this for the beach and bird walks . Bushnells are not super compact , but the compact 8 x40 model I bought is going on Ebay this week.good buy , should last another twenty years.If you are a new birder , keep it simple , buy these and several birdbooks , have fun .	1
for the price these work good ... the strap is terrible . but the optics are decent . and price is great .	1
The great magnification makes this a fine choice . The price seals the deal . Reviews warned about shaky images -- no problem if you have something to lean against .	1
These binoculars are pretty decent . Of course , you can not zoom in and see a hair on an elephants bottom but they work well for close to mid range bird watching and seeing what is going on in your neighborhood . Lol	1
We live in a roof top apartment and have a nice view of the city . Got these principally to be able to zoom in and see different details in the neighborhood and the city.We are binocular newbies - did not have any difficulties figuring out how to use them and are pleased with the purchase - we 've had a lot of fun with these binoculars .	1
Have tried different scopes and binoculars and this is the best for my backyard and woods . Easy to use , I support my elbows on the desk , and am able to use without a tripod . Perfect birdwatcher !	1
We recently bought a second computer for our home , and wanted both of them to share our broadband internet connection . I looked around at a lot of different routers , and this one seemed to be just what we needed . It is compact in design and was super easy and very quick to install ; the installation wizard is practically fool-proof . I am very pleased with this router , and we are surfing the web on either computer and simultaneously on both computers with no problems .	1
I have used this router for 2 years and have never had a problem other than the ones that I caused . All my fixes were performed by myself with little effort . As far as a firmware upgrade ... .I read that this should only be done when the router is not working as needed and should not be done just for the sake of being up to date . Linksys makes good products . I have there cable modem , hub and also a wireless router . Not only do there work great but I love the blue colors they use . : )	1
Setup was a breeze . Less than 30min out of the box and I had three computers sharing my cable modem . The manual goes over the basics for a beginner , but if you are planning on setting something a little more complicated you 'll have to look up some info online.There are problems running certain types of game servers , you got ta check game manufacturers website or check in some game forums.There is also a known issue with Quake 3 where you may lose your connection to the router and have to reboot . Flashing to an older firmware is the suggested fix , until Linksys figures it out.Other than those minor issues , I would definitely recommend this product .	1
This is an excellent product . I have a DSL with a static IP , and was regularly bombarded by hackers and CodeRed2 type viruses . Prior to purchasing this router I was using ZoneAlarm software firewall from Zone Labs ( a superb software firewall distributed free for personal use ) . ZoneAlarm was blocking hundreds of attacks every day . After I installed LinkSys 4-port router , ZoneAlarm did n't register even a single attack during past several days ( just to prove that the hardware firewall works ) . Configuring the LinkSys router and my private network was extremely simple - just followed the step-by-step simple instructions provided in the user 's manual . My previously configured VPN connecting my home PC to my workplace worked without any additional configuration . Prior to installing the router I was experiencing sporadic NetBIOS related problems terminating my connectivity to the Internet . My DSL provider was unable to solve the issue . After installing this router , the problem went away .	1
I set up a Linksys 4-port router and I am extremely pleased . It is fast , fast , fast ! However , I too have DSL from a provider that supports PPPoE and let me tell you , it pays to have friends who know network architecture ! I am a programmer but a mere developer is no match for this baby . I worked with Linksys online support and the tech told me the router was defective , and to send it back to Amazon . I did n't believe him , and my tech friend did n't either . Ten minutes on the phone and we had it up and running , set to fixed IP addresses for my PCs ( not DHCP ) . Once its up and running , it is a brave new world . I would rate it 5 stars if mere mortals could install it .	1
First off , I have to admit that I 'm an intermediate ( at best ) user . Far from a newbie ( I started back in the pre-DOS days with a Kaypro ! ) but I have been left in the dust in recent years.I have been using an older version of this same model router for 7+ years and found it incapable of handling my ISP 's hi-speeds . I was clocking only up to about 5-8 Mbps download ( my ISP supposed to deliver up to 20 Mbps ) .The good news is that once I managed to get this new version up and running ( about 2 hours and 3 phone calls ) , it was fantastic . I 'm getting 16-18 Mbps over most test servers.The bad news is that it was n't as simple to install it as I 'd hoped . First , I connected everything EXACTLY as the Wizard instructed . When it came to configure my router , it said it could not detect a router . I tried again . It said it could not configure the router . I tried again and again . I called my ISP to make sure the internet type , etc. , was correct.Then I called Linksys and got their call center in the Phillipines . The first customer service person I called was very friendly but told me I 'd need to connect directly to the modem so I could configure the router manually . Since I was having a bit of trouble doing that , I got a case number and told her I 'd call tech support back.I managed to get online by bypassing the router altogether and called Linksys back . I got a guy whose accent was so thick I had trouble understanding him . He was rude and impatient . He told me the advice the first person gave was wrong -- that I had to be connected to the router in order to manually change its settings ( which is , I have to admit , the correct info ) .When I had a little delay in reconnecting the cables ( with him waiting impatiently on the line ) , he asked me how many cables I had . I told him I had a cable from the computer to the router and one from the router to the modem . He asked again , with clear impatience in his voice , how many cables I had . I repeated my answer . Then he said it would be best is they did a remote hookup to make the changes to my computer . I do not feel comfortable with that but , reluctantly agreed . Then he told me they 'd be an extra charge for the service.I said NO , that I needed him to help me install the router . Well , I 'm not saying he hung up on me , but the line went dead at that point . Coincidence ? Perhaps.Anyway , I kept fiddling around , using different cables ( NOT the one that came with the router ) and giving my cable modem time to reset itself ( that may have been the key , I do n't know ) .Suddenly , everything was working ! ! ! ! I 'm so happy with the performance that I 'm like a new mother who immediately forgets the pain of childbirth . I have a healthy 16 Mbps connection and can easily dismiss the labor pains.So , bottom line is that the router itself is excellent but the documentation and customer service stink .	1
This unit works well . It took me quite a while to set it up on a Macintosh , and included a lot of guessing , since the instructions are not at all Mac friendly . Once up and running , however , it works like a charm . Mac instructions would have been helpful . In a nation that 's obsessed with diversity , there seems scant attention paid to diversity in computing .	1
This router is absolutely fantastic ! At first I was having all kinds of trouble because my DSL connection uses PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing . What was happening was after a varying amount of time , my DSL provider ( Earthlink ) would change the IP address during my session and the router is not able to recognize the change and therefore , it hangs . You then have to unplug it and reboot your computer . I have read about other people using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing having the same problems . It was getting frustrating . After messing around with this router for several days , I have finally discovered settings that alleviate this problem . I 'm sure many people will find this helpful , and it will save you a lot of aggravation if you are using PPPoE with dynamic IP addressing . First off , you need to flash the latest firmware to the router . You can download the firmware at the Linksys website Make sure you have at least Firmware version 1.36 or higher . In the web configuration utility , enable Connect on demand , and check the Keep Alive box . Now , here is the most important part ! Set the idle time to : 9999 minutes . It lets you login to your DSL provider and keep the same IP address for over a week . Try it out ! Maybe this tip will work as well for you as it did for me ! This router is fantastic and the speed is incredible ! It is the best router you can get for the price in my opinion . Even if you do n't know the first thing of networking , you can figure it out , it really is n't as hard as you imagine it before you purchase it . Once you have it , it seems to explain itself , and is extremely easy to configure . A great device to add to your office or home network . Definately 5 stars ! !	1
I had it open and up and running and all my computers going on my 100MB DSL speed and was so happy . Okay , it is easy to set up , BUT ... then came the problem . I run several MSN groups and suddenly I could not post messages ! Okay , I concede maybe not everyone expects to post at MSN groups , but ... ..Then WHOA NELLY - I went to Microsoft Windows Update Window and I could not access it . It could not scan my computer . Now wait a bloody minute ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Not being able to post in the MSN Groups is one thing , NOT being able to update your computer with Microsoft patches is Suicide ! I mean nearly EVERYONE needs to access Microsoft update window to keep their computer safe from all the wholes in XP ! ! ! THis is BAD OVERSITE.So I emailed them . I got a quick response that I had to go and set up port forwarding yadayada ... .EXCUSE ME ... suddenly the easy set up was NO SO EASY as promised.Yes , it is very good , yes it gives four computers 100MB speed at one and I am so thrilled . However , this BIG OVERSITE of not being able to access Microsoft is ridiculous . Yes , it can been fixed by changing the ports for forward microsoft traffic - but the point is WHY SHOULD THEY ? ? ? ? One of the most basic things we need to access Windows Update and you can not unless you make changes.Those changes SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE before the first one of this was shipping.Shame on them for making customers work , shame on them for not being as easy as they promised , and shame on them for ignoring nearly everyone will have to go through this and NOT GIVE any warning ! ! Four Stars for the product , four stars for their promt response - ONE STAR for their stupid plans on not including something every computer would need to access . If your computers are newer you will likely want to go wireless instead .	1
Just connect the router ( CABLE MODEM /DSL ) , the computers and you 're ready to surf ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ITs really easy to set up ... ... It just take 5 or 6 minutes to make any changes in the configuration in case that your ISP requires them ... It can work also as DHCP , that 's a great point if youu 're not an advanced user.Beleiveme , its a good deal !	1
After two years of continuous use I have had only one problemwith this product : I neglected to increase the number of DHCPclients to the number of computers I was using . The router wasset to 3 and I had 4 computers , so one of them was alwaysfailing to connect . I simply connected to the router using abrowser and IP address 192.168.1.1 and increased the number ofDHCP clients . I have had no trouble at all after that.Update : after 5 years of continuous use the router failed .	1
I do n't usually write reviews but I liked the Linksys BEFSR41 Cable/DSL router so much , I had to take the time to share my thoughts.Many of the online community are going with broadband these days because of the poor performance of modems , the busy signals and relatively high price of modem-based Internet service.Broadband with the Linksys is as good as it gets . Plug it in , and it works out of the box with no configuration but with some training , you can make the Linksys BEFSR41 do magic ! The incoming cable from the cable company plugs in to the cable modem provided by your Internet service provider . ( It actually is n't a modem but that 's another story . ) From there you plug the cable into your Linksys cable router and from there you can either plug 4 computers into that router or some hubs to attach even more people to the Internet . ( Up to 254 without some special network magic . ) That 's the basics.What many people do n't know is actually how your computer gets its address information . All computers , as we know , must have an IP address ( Internet Protocol ) to talk to another computer.The Linksys is both a DHCP server AND a DHCP client . ( DHCP = Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol . I 'll spare you the details but suffice to say , as a DHCP Server , this means that all your internal computers are given IP addresses from the Linksys router . Additionally , the Linksys can act as a DHCP client to your Internet service provider , as is generally required to do unless you have a business account and pay for a fixed IP address . That 's fun ! ) So anyway , you 're plugged in to the cable company and all your computers are happily getting IP addresses from the Linksys . Great . Well , there is a lot more.The Linksys BEFSR41 allows you to cascade up to 254 other computers to allow for access for 254 people to the Internet . Wow ! Considering that a T1 or even a partial T1 line can cost thousands per month , paying 40-60 dollars a month to give access to 254 people is incredible . ( The only problem might be if every user would attempt to download MP3s at one time , performance would be pretty bad but if only 20 % of your users are web browsing at any given time , this would be ok. ) There are other great features of the Linksys BEFSR41 like port filtering , where you can control the types of traffic that comes and goes through the Linksys . You can for example block all external traffic from getting in . OR , you can put up a web server and route all incoming traffic looking for a web server to that computer only , thus providing a nice security setup.This evaluation is getting too long so I 'll send but suffice to say that the Linksys BEFSR41 is amazing and extremely easy to use . You manage it from a web browser interface and there are free software ( Firmware ) updates available from linksys This is important because us `` hackers '' are always finding a way around security devices . Firmware updates provide a way for the folks at Linksys to stay ahead of current `` hacker '' technology .	1
I was a little nervous when I ordered this unit as some people have seemed to have a lot of problems with Cisco routers in general and this particular model as well . I have been using this on my home network for over 2 months now and it has been absolutely stable and my connection speed is much better than the router I used before . I rated customer support 4 stars but to be honest I have n't had to use it at all . Setup was as simple as connecting my computers , cable modem and powering it up . Very pleased with this router .	1
( ... ) I have never set up a network in all my life . Today I did : Three completely different Computers : Desktop AMD 1.4GHz - Windows XP , Desktop Pentium II 200 MHZ - Windows 98 , Laptop Pentium III 650 MHz - Windows 98 , Cable modem ... .Piece of cake . The Linksys does everything practically on its own.This thing works like a charm . Documentation is great , Speed is great ... .my home network rocks ! Highly recommend this router ! ! ! ! !	1
This product works wonderfully , as both a router and a switched hub . Installation was a snap , and I 've had zero trouble getting multiple PCs on the Internet at the same time . The switched hub manages local traffic efficiently , and supports Ethernet and Fast Ethernet clients concurrently with no problems.One word of advice . If you plan to add more than four PCs to your intranet , just get the one-port DSL router and use a separate switched hub . That way , all your connections are handled by the switch , instead of split between the router and the switch . There are no problems doing it either way , you just may save some money buying a one-port router , plus your switch may manage traffic better .	1
The Linksys Cable/DSL router and ethernet switch works . You plug it in , connect your computer ( s ) and modem to it and then add your internet username and password to the router using a simple web browser interface . That 's as hard as it gets installing this device . The built-in ethernet switch saves you space and money by eliminating yet another piece of equipment to attach several computers to your router/network .	1
I was given this router as a gift , personally , I had been looking at Netgear Routers , however , now having used this Linksys router for about 4 months , I am recommending them to everyone . For starters , ( and this REALLY impressed me because I was planning on spending the AFTERNOON getting it working ) I got this up and running within 5 minutes of taking it out of the box . There 's hardly ANY configuration to do and once it 's up , it 's up . There are lots of Advanced settings that can be tweaked and in the instance where I needed to do some Port Forwarding to my internal PC 's IP Address , it was easy to accomplish using the built in Web-Browser based Configuration Utility . Transferring files internally at 100Mbs is just awesome . I like the design with the & quot ; stackable & quot ; feature - I 've already filled my 4 ports ! Now I am considering getting the Wireless version of this same router and when I do , I 'll simply link them both together via the Uplink ports and then stack the new one on top . I 'm very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to connect multiple computers together to share files/internet access .	1
At the same time I bought the Linksys Cable Modem , I bought this router/switch to allow all the machines on my in-house network to access the Internet . It replaced my previous hub without a glitch , and smoothly connected to the cable modem . Everything works perfectly ! An added feature I was n't aware of , but which turned out to be helpful , was the ability to filter a particular MAC address to prevent access to the Internet . Quite handy , that .	1
Easy to set up and connect and it 's been working fine . Do n't even think about it . No need to , it just does its thing .	1
If you 've got cable or DSL internet access , you NEED this box ! What does it do ? Well ... 1 . It 's an internet firewall . It prevents anyone from the outside getting into your computers.2 . It 's a Network Address Translator . It allows you to connect 4 different computers to one Internet connection- and this can be expanded up to 253 computers , with the addition of inexpensive hubs.3 . It 's a 100baseT switch . This means it allows all the computers you connect to it to communicate with each other at speeds of 100 million bits per second- that 's nearly two million times faster than a 56KB modem ! And it 's very easy to set up- I had my home network running in a half hour . All you need to use it is a network card in your computer- something most computers come with these days- and enough ethernet cables to connect all your home computers to it.Like a lot of people these days , when I remodeled my house I ran two pieces of Category 5 wire to every phone outlet ; now I can plug a computer into any room of the house , and it 's on the internet.If you 've got more than one computer in the house , and a high speed connection , you need this box . Even for just one computer , the firewall features alone are worth the money to make your system completely hack proof .	1
My buddies and I bought this unit way back when at twice the price . After some setup screwups we all got our linkys working perfectly with our cable modems . Since then our linkys have been real work horses . I love the linky hardware firewall protection . The only time I need to drop protection and go into the linky dmz zone is for MS Netmeeting . You will not go wrong buying this product .	1
This was exactly what I was looking for when I got my cable connection . Easy to set up , took 15 minutes ! If a friend comes over with his computer , easy to plug them in on the network to share the connection or just swap some files . And the firewall is great for protecting my computer from the rest of the net ! I love this cable router and HIGHLY recommend it .	1
I 've had this router for 2 years , and it has been great ! ... Linksys has great tech support ... I did fry my first one doing a firmware upgrade , but that was because I used an old TFTP program ( that they supplied with a different version upgrade ) for a newer upgrade ( always use the one that comes with the upgrade ) ( plus be carefull in other ways , by not having any other programs running ( including the automatic ones in your startup folder and system tray ) , give your computer a fresh reboot before attempting install , etc . Even though the router was fried , linksys just immediately shipped me out a new one and had me return the old one within 30 days ( or else be charged ) . Another thing about this company is ... do n't immediately install new firmware updates . It 's best to wait a couple-few months , then call in to their tech support to see if there are any issues with it . Besides , unless there are new features you need or really desire in the new firmware , I would n't recommend upgrading anyway.Anyway , this router ( and company ) ROCKS ! ( this is based on much use AND probably 40 calls to tech support over the years about various issues ( most of them short questions , I try not to abuse the customer support ) . I do n't know how they sell such a great product and support it so well when these things are going for such bargain basement prices now ! I thought that even at [ the price I paid } , and now I 'm really flaberghasted . I know that whenever I buy network gear , it will be from Linksys in the future ( as long as they continue with their excellence in both product and customer service ) .Anyway , if you do n't neeed wireless capabilities ... GET THIS ROUTER for home/small office use . If you need wireless too , then check out their BEFW11S4 ( though I ca n't vouch for it , my bet is , if it 's from Linksys , it 's at least decent , if not great ! )	1
I just moved into a new place and got a cable modem ( Surfboard ) . Previously , my computer and the one that was here already both had dialup connections . One is XP Home and the other XP Pro . They both had network cards but they were n't used until now . First I set up the cable modem on the other computer . All was well and I decided to share the connection with my computer . So I picked this router up ( and a $ 10 rebate too ) . Installation went like this:1 . Powered everything down.2 . Opened box , rummaged around.3 . Took plug from original computer and put in router ( in `` Internet '' spot ) .4 . Took included network cable and plugged into computer and into router ( in one of the 4 spots ) .5 . Took network cable I had laying around ( you will have to buy one for each computer/laptop you want to connect if you do n't have it ! ! ! ) and plugged into my computer.6 . Powered up everything.7 . Grabbed the manual to see what was next while the Windows'es loaded . Looked up and noticed the icon on both PC 's `` acquiring network address '' . When that went away , checked websites - VIOLA ! I did n't have to do anything else ! And I thought I 'd be at this all day . I love this thing ; ) I imagine it would be more difficult to set up on Windows 98 ( ugh ) but with 2 Win XP 's it was a breeze .	1
This router performed as promised . Following the CD to INSTALL it , is essential , and easy to do . But there is no manual , no quickstart guide , and no trouble-shooter that comes with it . All of those things are on the CD ; limited as that is . And to make personal settings , refine it , or trouble-shoot it ; you have to go online , and do research . The internal settings can be VERY complicated . I 'm attempting to use it for my TiVo to transfer recordings from my TiVo to my PC . It is taking almost more work than is worth the effort . The Router itself works exactly as it should . Since there is no manual , and findind Linksys Tech Support is very difficult ; I 'd suggest finding a good tech support place online , read it , and see if you want to delve into all that this type of connection may require . All in all , I may go back to NOT using a router at all .	1
I found this product very easy to setup and easily installed . For the money I could n't find anything that came as close . My only complaint is the lack of manual support for advanced features and the fact that it did not come with a CAT5 cable .	1
I installed this router to network a couple of computers in my home . Installation was a snap and it works GREAT . I highly reccomend this router to anyone of any computer experience level .	1
While I am retiring my Phonelink network as I now use Wi-fi everywhere I would like to say that I have been very happy with those cards : They only provide about 10 Mbps but that is good enough to access the Internet.They do not suffer from interference.An interesting fact is that they somehow work on Windows 7 32-bit using the old Windows 2000 driver .	1
4 computers networked over distances of up to 150 feet . Used existing phone lines . Easy setup , very fast , does not interfere with other phone uses . Drawback is no simple way ( that I have found ) to share a broadband connection . Linksys tech assistance quite limited . Internet sharing software included with system outdated and not upgradable and not supported by software publisher .	1
Small office , 3 machines linked on one phone line ( which is also fax line ) , 2 Win98s , 1 Win95 . Hardest to set up with Win95 . For some reason driver did not seem to want to load . I had to completely uninstall network components and reinstall , then install driver manually . Worked after that . Think it was a comflict with a Bios setting but never confirmed it .	1
I bought this relative antique a few months ago and have already used it twice to solve problems . Since it 's well-supported by every Linux and Windows that I 've tried , it let me get two different laptops online long enough to get drivers working for their built-in ethernet and wifi adapters . It would also be useful for adding an additional adapter to a computer to act as a bridge or do any other network tinkering . The driver floppy was a nice touch . I 'm not sure my son had ever seen one .	1
I bought these because they were in the list of adapters supported by the old TIVOS and they worked great !	1
I just received my USB100TX and connected it directly to my TiVo Series 2 with the supplied USB A-B cable . It does *not* come with a CAT-5 UTP Cable , but I have plenty spare and hooked it up . As soon as it was wired to both the TiVo and a hub in my nearby wiring closet the link light was activated . I did not need any of the manuals or driver disks that came in the package.Within minutes I 'd configured my TiVo to recognize the network adapter and my Linksys BEFSR41 Firewall/Router had allocated it a DHCP address.I immediately ran the test-connection and also forced a daily update.Downloading schedules are super quick compared to the dialup option . Obviously new firmware updates will also be significantly quicker . Plus the phone line wo n't be tied up during the call.I had previously tried a different USB/Ethernet adapter and my TiVo did not recognize it ( D-Link USB-650 ) so beware of using that on a TiVo.The Linksys USB100TX is the wired adaptor recommended by TiVo and it works perfectly , first time .	1
I have 2 of the Elph models and I must say I think they 're the best APS cameras available . They are incredibly compact , very sturdily built and take wonderful pictures . The Elph 2 has a smooth 2:1 zoom and a much-improved flash unit ( over the original Elph 1 ) . While I prefer my Elph LT270 , whichever Elph you choose will make you happy for years to come .	1
What else can I say other than this item worked in the camera that I bought it for . I look forward to the day when these cards are cheaper . But the ScanDisk product was competively priced with other brands .	1
These headphones are good if your intentions are correct . Sennheiser calls them the 570 Symphony . They are specificially engineered for symphony music and it is clear in the audio . If you want to listen to your Mp3s , buying these headphones may be a bit overboard . If you listen to vocal-oriented music like opera or live recordings the SSSS 's will make you cringe . The midrange feels very wierd . They do make classical sound good.They also have absolutely amazing clarity . While the frequency responce is a bit ackward , if details of the sound is what you are looking for then these are what you are looking for . The Duofol technology , of which I was skeptical at first , is amazing . The sound is crisp and clear . There is no moaning and droaning from these headphones . The sound is very very detailed . These would be great for people listening through sound for small , quiet details or for sample editing when wavematching is needed . The detail provided is beautiful for that . So know what the headphones are designed for before you punch $ 130.00 into them . They help me , so I like them , but I can see that there may be some problems for some people .	1
These headphones sound fabulous with most music . They are very uncolored and do n't fatigue or rip your head off . The midrange is very smooth and silky and they image vocals well . They are also the most comfortable headphone I 've ever worn . I listen to hard rock , jazz and classical and find all that music pleasing through them . I use them for listening to CDs and in my home studio.On the down side , as some people pointed out they are very inefficient and require a decent pre-amp to drive them . My Sony S2 Walkman can barely drive them so I use these with a Rotel stereo pre-amp or Mackie mixing board . They also distort if you drive them to moderately loud levels so if you like your rap music loud , these are n't for you.I demo 'd these against several other Sennhieser models ( 560 & 580 I think ) and 3 Grado models in the same store . I also listened to some Sony MDR-7506 and AKG K240S Studio in another store . I thought the Sony 's were a decent pair of phones and so were the AKGs but I found these to be superior in terms of having a very natural and smooth sound . The Grado 's ripped my head off because they have a very bright and forward sound .	1
Several years ago I bought a Sennheiser 490 for [ some money ] and I consider that to be a [ bad purchase ] . A while ago I bought a Sennheiser 570 for [ some money ] , this one is a better choice.The headphone is huge but very light . It is tailored for `` symphony '' according to the description . Indeed when I use it to listen to classic music I do like its smooth sound . The treble is clear but it is a little dark in the low frequency.For vocals my Grado SR60 does a much better job than the HD570 by presenting a spacious and liquid image . But HD570 is doing fine for classic music due to the smoothness of its sound . If you like relaxed sound then you will like HD570 but if you like warm and openness in sound this probably is not your cup of tea.This cans is not very sensitive so you might need to have an amp to do it justice . Considering spending [ money ] for a brand new HD570 , there really is n't too much to complain about .	1
The Pocket PC platform is amazing , but the Jornada is not the best implementation . It is much smaller than the Casio E-115 , and the flip-up screen cover is great , but I am returning it . HP has recently admitted the device only displays 4,096 colors ( 12-bit ) instead of the advertised 65,536 colors ( 16-bit ) . Now I know why web page graphics seem a little off . Also , the screen completely washes out in natural light , even on a cloudly day outside . I 'm going to go with an iPaq instead .	1
This one is not the fastest . Does n't have the nicest screen , but it 's the only one I would take to war , and I mean it ... I have two kids , 6 & amp ; 3 . I have dropped it , sat on it . You name it . It has the best price and the controls ( wheel , snooze , screen off , record , etc . ) are placed in the right places , except for playing games . But that 's not what I bought it for . The cover is not pretty , but it will really protect the screen . I did n't even bother to buy a case . It will do okay inside a jean 's pocket . I bought a 128 meg viking card and screen protectors . I am all set . Next buy will be a car charger so I can play wma 's with no limit . Right now the 548 is the best buy .	1
I feel that the HP protectors are a must-have accessory , but as with anything , they have their ups and downs . The ups are obvious ; protection from annoying scratches and of course much easier application than the off-brand sticky protectors , which are a huge pain in the ace to put on . The only thing that really annoys me about them is the way they scratch so easily , but hey , would n't you rather a cheap piece of plastic be scratched than the unreplaceable screen . That 's right , unreplaceable . HP can not install new screens . The only option is to buy a new one . Also , the sensitivity is somewhat reduced in certain places , more specifically the corners . If you want to take the risk , go for it , but if you want great protection , get these now .	1
Just bought this little player from Amazon.com in an unbeatable price ... I like its good workmanship , stylish and most important ... high qualily sound ! The case fit nice and tight with a belt clip on the back . It is cushioned to protect it from dropping accidentally.Installing the software is easy and when you register it online you can upgrade to a new BASIC version for FREE.The only thing I do n't like is it uses it 's own back pack memory ... . that means high price tag . It would be perfect if it takes smartmedia card.One more thing I do n't like is the ear phone . My ears hurt after wearing them for awhile .	1
The Diamond Rio 600 is a paradox . It 's twice as good as anything currently on the market , but half as much as you need . There 's something very right about each of the three components of the system -- headphones , body and software -- and yet there are serious deficiencies with each part.The Rio 's headphones are marginally tinny at any volume , and stressed at higher volumes , but good enough for a portable you 'll probably use in a noisy environment anyway . To be sure , other headphones will be needed to fully realize the sound possibilities of the Rio , but the ones included give you at least the beginnings of great sound . Their rather odd , around-the-ear construction is both sensible and awkward . They 're perfect for using while working out , because they never fall out , regardless of how vigorously one behaves . But they 're hard to get used to because they do take a comparatively longer time to put in than other headphones . Serious audiophiles will dismiss them outright ; those of us just looking for workout music will probably get used to their oddness.The body of the Rio is its clear strength . It 's about the size of a pager-but lighter . Of all the portable music solutions I shopped -- CD , cassette , and digital alike-this one is the very best in terms of size/quality ratio . It 's the best thing I 've ever used for working out . It 's also the best device currently available in terms of expandability . Though on the surface it seems to have less memory than the Rio 500 , and than many other newer .mp3 players , it has the capacity for adding on 340 mb . Also , the fact that it takes the .wma ( Windows Media ) format effectively means that you can store what would be the equivalent of 64mb of songs in the .mp3 formatThere are some reservations , though . First , its small size means that the battery is tucked away in a pretty inaccessible place . It 's somewhat tricky seating a new battery . It 's not impossible , mind you , and it 's worth the effort given the benefit of the unit 's small size , but it 's still frustrating on occasion . Second , while a battery does actually give 10 hours of use , the unit 's battery life estimator is never accurate . It deducts time too slowly at the start of a battery , so that by the time you get to 6 hours of apparent time left , you actually have only 1 or 2 hours . It 's not a huge problem , once you figure it out , but it can be infuriating at first . Third , the unit does n't come with a belt clip holder or an FM tuner . They 're both available , but they 're extra . I can understand the FM tuner being extra , but it seems ridiculous for a portable music player to come without the means to make it truly portable.Finally , there 's the software . Easily the weakest element of the Diamond Rio 600 , it 's only a *little* more than a way to add on $ 20 to the price of the unit . It 's entirely too difficult to install and get running . I installed the version off the included CD . When I got it running , it linked me to rioport.com , which informed me there was an update available . This update , however , was really only for the Rio 300 and 500 , and so it failed to recognize the Rio 600 as being present . So I uninstalled the update and tried again with the CD version . Then after a mere 50 rips , it told me I had to pay to `` unlock '' the program . So I tried to unlock , but the software never allowed me to get to the `` pay '' screen . I then reinstalled the update and miraculously was allowed to unlock the program . But this version still did n't recognize the Rio 600 . So I uninstalled the update and reinstalled the original . Finally , everything worked . Hardly an encouraging start . Then , I instructed the program to search my hard drives and come up with a database of playable media . This it did , but it found a lot of ` junk ' files I wanted to delete . Unbelievably , the program does n't allow you to group delete , so I had to individually delete each file I did n't want . Finally , after hours of time and $ 20 , I got the software set up and ready to use . But then came another one of those little Rio paradoxes . One of the strengths of the software is that it allows you to read a CD at a variety of different compressions . You can decide to fit more of your songs on the Rio and sacrifice a little quality . The problem is that you might want a song at the highest quality to burn a CD ( which the software also does ) but at a lower one to send to the Rio . The result is that you practically have to read each CD twice . That 's a lot of hard disk space to dedicate to your music library . Hopefully updates will include some sort of converter , so that you only have to scan CDs once.On balance , I highly recommend the Rio , especially if you 're just looking for workout music . Be warned , however , that it wo n't be quite the effortless pathway to great music that the merchandising proclaims , and that the Rio is based on modularity . It has the greatest potential of any current .mp3 player -- it can be worn comfortably , has the largest potential memory , can play FM music , and can even be used on your car 's lighter -- but you 're going to have to pay for each added function .	1
This cord seems as if it will suffice . It is long enough to reach from the outlet on the outside corner of the house to the backyard shed that I am converting into a workshop ( hence the need for electrical power ) yet can be easily coiled onto a fence post mounted storage apparatus when not needed.I 'll see how it holds up to the Oregon weather , and update this review , after some time has passed .	1
I have found this to be a reliable cord , I use it for hand tools etc . and lighting and have no problems with it , the 16/3 wire is good enough for the uses I have for it .	1
This chord works great outdoors , rain or shine . I leave it out 24/7 and it is attached to my bug zapper light .	1
Well , it seems sturdy enough . It 's flexible and because it 's green it does n't call attention to itself as an orange cord would . So far , I 'm happy .	1
I have been using this extension cord for a few months now with a radiator type oil heater . I was expecting the cord to heat up & short out . It has not done that . I live in a really old house & the circuit breakers kept flipping off when I was using this heater in my room.The plus ins are far & few between & almost all the circuits are on the same breaker . I placed this cord across my room out the door & plugged it into a completely different circuit . It has been working great for me.I like the white cause I can see if there is any electrical shorts if they occur in the cord . It is nice & thick & has been holding up just great.The price was really good for my budget . Great buy !	1
I of course would not recommend my situation if you were attaching a lot of devices to the APC Power outlet strip , but since I have so few devices , I am not worried about using essentially a 15 amp to 20 amp adapter plug . I checked my local home improvement store before purchasing this but was not able to find it . I went back to my home improvement store and found one later , but I believe it might have been priced a little more at my local home improvement store.The quality of the cable is very good , so if you need something to adapt the 20 amp only plug to a 15 amp only receptacle , I highly recommend this one .	1
I recently purchased one of these recorders and found it to be quick easy , and no fuss . It has great functionality and the external input is a good touch	1
OK , so no one will mistake the photos for professional ones , but these disposable cameras are great ! I take one with me when I go to raves , 'cause I do n't want to lose my more expensive camera . Photo quality is quite reasonable . The camera is loaded with fast film , so it works in all light conditions with help from the flash . Might as well activate the flash for every picture , since it makes outdoor pictures look better , too . Plus , when you consider you 're throwing away the camera , there 's no point in trying to save battery power .	1
I had a set of Sennheiser 590 headphones for years , until an internal wire let go and killed one channel . I saw so many positive reviews of theses headphones and got such a sweet deal on Amazon that I just had to try them . They are comfortable in the extreme . And the sound is rich and very satisfying for hours on end . For the first time , I find that I am satisfied to listen to headphones instead of my speakers . They are open backed , so when my wife is clunking around in the kitchen I have to switch to my closed backed Beyerdynamics . Otherwise , these get the nod .	1
Must say initially did not really think much of the 600 's . Bought them on sale and because of the superior feedback . They absolutley need a break in period . The soundstage was very tight , now with many hours on them they are opening up and begining to open up and sound relaxed . At first I did not have an Headphone amp and drove them only with and Ipod and the 600 's sounded flat/dull . Thought i wasted my money ! After many , many hours of research I settled on the Firestone Audio Fubar 3 MkII USB DAC/Headphone Amp . Oh boy what a difference ! IMO you absolutley need an amp to drive these high impedence headphones properly . Bless you if your happy with the sound without an ampifier is all i can say , but you are missing out big time without one.On a down side tho , I do not hear the mystical soundstage yet . I it probably my sound source at fault , well hopefully it is . I do have an MP3 collection recorded at highest quality , maybe the headphones need more time and breakin ? Overall they are pretty awesome , especially gotten at half price !	1
I decided they were a bit too warm for my tastes . They are a classic however , and sound great for the money in particular .	1
Wow , It 's been over a year since I started my Hi-fi journey , quite hard to believe for me . Before I owned the HD600s , I had exclusively been listening to theBrainwavz B2 Dual Armature Noise-Isolating Earphones . I heard the HD600s for the first time in mid-July , and while I was n't blown away at the first listen , I definitely knew I needed something other than the B2s , because the treble spike in the B2s was starting to get on my nerves . After doing a bit of research , I finally settled on the HD600s.Main equipment used in this review : iPod classic 6th gen 80gbObjective 2Fiio L3/L9 LOD cablesMusical preferences : Classic Rock ( Beatles , Stones , Steely Dan , ELO , CCR , ect . ) J-Pop/Anisong ( ClariS , OPs and EDs for Anime ) Indie ( Mumford & Sons , Black Keys , Awolnation , Modest Mouse ) Classical ( Just starting out ) Jazz ( Just starting out ) Metal ( Mostly soft stuff like Metallica ) Video Game/Anime/Visual Novel OSTsBuild Quality/Design : While I do n't think the HD600s are built poorly they are n't the final word in build quality . The glossy plastic material used for most of the headband feels very sturdy and durable , but the black plastic surrounding the driver does not feel quite as good . That particular plastic looks cheaper , but still does n't feel too bad . You wo n't break them with everyday use though.The overall design of the HD600s is very good to my eyes . Most of the pictures online make the blue marble finish seem way brighter than it actually was with my unit . While they do n't scream durability or style , it should n't be enough for you to discount them entirely yet until you hear them yourself.The cable is detachable and is very good quality . I have not and will not use anything other than stock cables , as I believe they 're a waste of money.Comfort : The HD600s are the most comfortable headphones I 've ever worn . Although that does n't say that much considering I have n't listened to too many cans . The clamping force is average to me , and the headband is very comfortable to me . Even though my ears and head are relatively large , I never experienced any discomfort issues . My ears also fit comfortably within the earpads . As a frame of reference , after listening to the Q701s for about an hour , the headband would start to hurt my head.The velour pads are also very sturdy and do n't make your ears feel hot after extended use.Sound Quality : Well , this is the big one . So far in this review you 'd wonder why anyone would ever spend $ 400 on a pair of headphones with average build quality and good comfort ! Obviously the most important part to many of you is the sound . I will try to do my best to explain the sound , but keep in mind I have n't heard any other headphones in the price range , my closest frames of reference are $ 150 IEMs.-Bass : The bass of the HD600s has good texture as well as extension . While sub bass is lacking , mid bass is well controlled and provides a nice punch . Bass is definitely good , although it does n't satisfy my basshead craving . Instead , it stays relatively contained and provides a nice warmth to the sound without being anywhere close to overpowering.-Mids : The mids are the focal point of the HD600s , and they are wonderful . All of the instruments sound completely natural . The timbre on every instrument sounds awesome . While with the B2s some instruments sounded a bit weird , and some not completely natural , the HD600 absolutely dominates everything I 've heard to date . This is the selling point of the headphones for me . The other thing that sold me on the HD600s was the vocals . While they are n't heavily forward per se , they are very intimate and engaging compared to the IEMs I own . I will discuss vocals more in the soundstage section.-Treble : The treble of the HD600s embodies a love/hate relationship I have with them . The treble is somewhat recessed compared to the mids , although there are various spikes which I find add a small amount of sparkle to the sound and also make the cymbals crash with some authority . But these treble spikes are only a couple decibels , and so the HD600s will never hurt your ears with too much treble if you 're sensitive to treble spikes like I am . Obviously , the advantage to having laid back treble is the reduced chance for fatigue after long listening sessions as I have noted above . However , the treble is also not as detailed as other headphones that have a more balanced treble.-Detail : When listening to the HD600s , I often struggle to find microdetails in recordings such as when the vocalist takes a breath , but instrument detail is fairly well done . While I find this somewhat annoying , I find myself not paying too much attention to the small details nowadays , and instead listening to the bigger picture.-Soundstage : The HD600s are obviously open backed , so the soundstage is n't bad . While I never got the feeling that the sound was too far away from my ears , I do n't feel that the soundstage is closed in at all . The soundstage is better than any of the IEMs I have tried . I also feel that the center stage is very well done . Vocals and instruments that are supposed to be in the middle of the soundstage sound much more intimate and engaging than anything I have previously heard . Overall the soundstage is above average , but still not perfect.Musical Pairings : The HD600s sound awesome with just about any genre you throw at them , whether it be electronic or jazz . The only area the HD600s lack in is genres/songs with a lot of sub bass , which is relatively quiet.Closing Thoughts : These headphones are simply excellent any way you look at them . While the build quality might not meet military standards , they should last you a long time . Besides , you were n't planning on taking your open back HD600s into combat with you , were you ?	1
I had the nice little Bose Accoustamass speakers for big , clear sound from my Left/Right/Center channels . I had the powerful Infinity subwoofer to thump the neighbors right off their sofa.But what to buy to replace those ancient rear speakers I 'd gotten for free with a so-so stereo so many years ago ? I did n't want to spend much money for mere rear channel sound , but I did n't want to compromise much quality , either . Frankly , it seemed a waste to spend any money at all back there.Then I heard Wharfedale 's Diamond Anniversery Bookshelf Speakers.They look great , they sound great . And Amazon has a price you just ca n't beat.Not only do my DTS and Dolby 5.1 movies sound better than ever , but my neighbors find me just a little bit more bothersome.UPDATE : We 've moved into a bigger house , and are now using these as our main speakers in upstairs living room . They sound so delicious , I realize they were wasted as mere rear-channel speakers back at the old condo . There 's no better deal in bookshelf speakers today . Buy these .	1
A great product for traveling , compact , light and easy to focus . I take them everywhere I travel . I highly recommend .	1
Lighting took out the integrated net card on our Dell . I had an open slot so I bought this to replace it . It works fine . Follow the instructions and load the drivers first , and no problems with setup .	1
Do n't Be Fooled By The Cheap Price ! This card is a breeze to install . First install the software , then install the card , turn your computer back on , and your ready for the internet or to connect to a network ! I have installed at least five of these cards into computers over the past year , and have not gotten one call that they are not working ! This is a great price point , and great product .	1
Bought this because I was having trouble with my internet connection and suspected it was ethernet adapter . The price for this was so low that even though it turned out that my problem was not the old adapter I removed I left the new one installed and it is performing well .	1
I like little transistor radios . When I see something different I buy it for my little collection . They are not especially great sounding or long range . Just a toy .	1
This is what it is , and it is good for that . I got it for my 10-year-old for camping . A very basic , small radio . Works great for her and for a take-along camping radio she can use as she wishes .	1
Great little radio with excellent FM reception . Am could be a little better but of course this is a very small radio .	1
This is a great little radio . Reception and sound is fantastic . Great for carrying around .	1
Pretty good little radio . Reception could be a little better but that just might be my rural location . I got a couple of these for emergencies and keep 1 in my INCH bag .	1
Well after 40 years they better have these tape players cooking your dinner.Works like it should . But it for my Father .	1
I purchased this CF Modem card to use with my Ipaq 3600 series pocket pc . It works Great ! The unit came with the modem , phone cable , and a small instruction manual.I followed the instruction manual to configure my dial-up connection and email settings . Everything worked great . It was also nice to see a chart at the back of the book noting DNS settings for the larger ISP's.I have been using the modem for a little over a week now . I have had no problems and am very satisfied .	1
Terrific headphones for the price . You certainly wo n't come anywhere dedicated listening headphones with these , but they are a significant step up from earbuds . Surprisingly good low end - not too detailed , but strong .	1
I remember these from the 90 's - still good for casual listening , light enough for activewear , and well built so it should hold up to daily use . Decent sound quality , rolled off bass and high end , but also good for checking your mix against a 'normal ' set of headphones . Will buy again .	1
I purchased these headphones for my Fathers Ipod . He 's one of those people who does n't desire top quality tech , he just wants things to work , so I was looking for something that was cheap but functional for him.As far as the product goes , if you are someone looking for a plain old pair of normal headphones , I see no reason to not buy these Panasonic's.Pros : -They are very lightweight-They are comfortable-Over the ear headphones , so you do not have to worry about them falling out of your ear like a pair of in-ear ones would at this price point.-Sound : for 5 bucks , I was highly impressed . They are not your Bose headphoes , but they work.Cons : -The actual headphone was tad bit smaller then expected.So once again , if you are in the market for a normal pair of headphones that just work , you can NOT go wrong with these !	1
I liked these because they were light weight and cheep . And they work great I use them on my laptop and dvd player .	1
These headphones are incredible for the price . They sound as good as my PortaPros and they cost much less . They are also very comfortable . Buy several pairs !	1
hard to believe these are only 5 bucks . order at least 2 pair , it will save you the shipping costs of ordering the second pair you will surely want . deep base-hard to believe !	1
I have no complaints about these headphones . I 've had better and worse and these get the job done which is all I was looking for . A pair of nice headphones that I could use on my computer .	1
I like these little headphones ! They 're lightweight and the sound they put out is quite substantial . Not super-high end audio-snob substantial , but good enough to watch an action movie or edit some footage without costing an arm and a leg . I like the feeling of not having to baby them . So far they 've held up , but if I do break them , I 'm not too worried . $ 6.44 and I 'm back in business 2 days later . 5/5 would recommend .	1
I like this headset so much , I have already purchased 3 of these headsets , not all at once though . The first headset that I bought , I have had for a few years now , and it is still working as good as new.I have had other similar headsets , and these are the best sounding ones when playing music . They are also very light weight and comfortable to wear . For the price ( currently under $ 5 ) , I highly recommend them ! Suggested improvements : Volume switch on cord and foldable	1
I would have given this pair of headphones five stars , if it were not for the fact that , five stars is hard to give for an audio product that costs less ( in some cases ) than a value meal ! That said , This is definitely the best cheap pair of headphones I have ever owned ! The sound is great , given the price point . We 'll see about the & # 34 ; last-ability & # 34 ; , but this is a great little product , and if you 're looking for an everyday , portable , decent sound quality pair of phones - look no further . These are it . Buy them . They really do sound very good for what they are .	1
These were purchased as a replacement for a set that deteriorated and to offer a variation for earbuds for some newly acquired audio equipment -- an iPod.They are comfortable and offer relatively good sound quality for an economy item . Husband feels he does n't get quite the same range of treble and bass as he does with ear buds but that may be the mode of sound transmission.We would recommend them as a good purchase .	1
I ca n't imagine a better sound from my MP3 player , at any price . And these are practically free ! I 'll report back if there are durability issues ...	1
I love the sound of this headphone . The bass is rich and the sound is very clear with no distortions . It is also comfortable for the ears for long use . Definitely would recommend this one .	1
I bought these to fit a portable CD player . The ear phones worked just fine . It was the CD player that took the lick . I mean for the price I was just glad they worked .	1
These lightweight and convenient headphones were nearly as good as my $ 80 Klipsch S4 earbuds and over $ 100 Bose over the ear headphones , for $ 5 ! ! ! ! ! Heck , they 're almost paying YOU to buy them ! Tight bass , great mids and highs . These were highly rated online , which is why I bought them , and for the price , I do n't think there 's a better headphone on the market .	1
I wanted some headphones for my girls to use with the computer or DSI , they are n't fond of the earbud types which were all I had lying around from my MP3 devices , so I purchased these.They 've held up well , as they 've been used regularly for over a year . The sound quality and fit around the ear are both nothing special as sound leaks out through them as they do n't have a tight fit [ as designed ] .However , they get the job done as a cheap set of 'extra ' headphones just to have lying around the house . I 'm impressed with the durability given the price.Overall quality for the money is outstanding , but overall quality is only so-so .	1
These are the best portable headphones in this price range . Good bass and smooth , natural sound . In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price . If you can afford more , consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 40-50 dollars . But if you 're on a budget or do n't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones , these are definitely the ones to get .	1
I 've had these for months now and they are great.However , as a prior reviewer noted , you must have an 'average size ' head . These do not have any horizontal expansion for a person who has a 'wide ' head.I have an 'average size ' head ( lol ) and these sound great.I have thought about purchasing another pair ; I like them so much.I have given two of these as gifts to friends .	1
Okay , I 'm giving these 5 stars because for what they are and the cost they are great . Are they the best headphones out there ? Absolutely not but they 're not advertised as that anyway . They 're not noise cancelling but I 've purchased 4 sets so far because they are a great deal . I use them while at work in an office and I can still hear the firearm and the sound quality is great for use with my smartphone or the work PC . If you do n't want to spend a lot of money you 'll be very happy with these headphones .	1
These inexpensive headphones are a very good deal . They are comfortable and the sound quality is clear , but with one caution : they do n't produce much volume . I have to turn the volume up pretty high on my devices to get them loud enough .	1
I love the bass response ! I just watched a movie wearing these headphones and they really brought the audio of the movie to life ! Truly impressive . The specs say the frequency response of these headphones is 16 Hz - 22 kHz . That 's an audio range that extends both below and above the range of the average human ear ! And they sure seem to live up to these specs . I found them quite comfortable to wear for the duration of the movie . I would definitely recommend you give these a try !	1
Does n't say it has a volume control and it does n't , but for the price it 's phenomenal ! For one percent of the price of a boise , it 's a comparitively better value .	1
I have only had it for a month now . The quality of sound is good and very clear , and the volume of my iPod does not seem to impede the output of sound . Most of the time , I wear the Panasonic lightweight headphones while running/jogging , and it fits snugly on my head , making it perfect for exercising . The cord is quite long , so I usually wrap it around the iPod to make it fit better in my pockets .	1
Cheap and light . This is a great budget headphone for your PC , especially if you start becoming annoyed by in-ear phones . Keep in mind there is no noise cancellation/noise direction , so do n't think you 're safe to watch porn on max volume .	1
This is just what I was looking for - an inexpensive high-quality set of headphones . It fits on top of your head ( traditional - the way I like it ) as opposed to behind your head . Great sound quality .	1
They are lightweight and the sound is good . Since the actual ear pieces are convex and do not fit to the ear they can slide off a little too easily .	1
Low cost headphones that sound good , fit well , and do everything they are supposed to do . What else can you ask for ?	1
Ordered these from Amazon because I could no longer find them in local stores . These headphones have great sound no matter what I 'm listening to , and they 're durable . I stuff them into drawers , bags , under pillows , and they keep working . One pair usually lasts me from twelve to eighteen months . Really worth the money .	1
I have several brands of headphones including the excellent denon ah-1001 , $ 130.but for every day use on all your radios , computers and other devices for about $ 5.00.the panasonic rp-ht21 headphones are an excellent choice with excellent sound.You cant go wrong when ordering these from amizon , I have several of these and will probably order more in the future .	1
I bought these to use with my kindle fire . They work great . They are very lightweight and comfortable.I 'm pleased with this purchase .	1
My title pretty much says it all . If you want great thrilling sound spend more money but for me this works fine . They are lightweight and the sound surprised me . I am more than pleased .	1
Husband is very pleased with these ... and surprised . Was n't expecting these to be so good . Was exactly what he wanted for his need . Inexpensive but so worth it . Lightweight , sound quality is very , very good . He 's a happy man !	1
i was frankly shocked by these headphones- the sound quality is amazing , considering the price , and they 're well-constructed and comfortable to wear . They just blow the white , ipod headphones out of the water- no comparison at all . The only con for me is that the sounds from the headphones leak out into the air , meaning these will probably be good in busy settings , but not so good in a library or office setting .	1
I have had these for quite some time and they are still going strong ! They have great sound and great bass for the little headphones that they are . Highly recommended .	1
The headphones are lightweight and have an excellent sound quality for what they are . I watch videos and have used them without a problem .	1
The best low cost headphones I can find . The sound quality is decent , but it is not very mechanically rugged . This is my second one as the first one broke at the sliding adjustment band after a few years of use while exercising . But at this price I can afford to replace it every two years .	1
I am happy with these headphones . They feel decent to the head and ears , work fine . I own 3 or 4 pairs and has had no trouble with any of them . The round listening parts readily come off and go back on , meaning that if the cords are hopelessly tangled ( my kids do that all the time ) , you can take the listening part off and make the untangling much easier to do.I do n't know what they mean by `` XBS Port '' here . These headphones fit in regular headphone slots , like those in computers , radios , iPads , etc.I am ordering another one of these because my kids are always misplacing headphones and fighting for them . These are so inexpensive that I can afford to keep ordering until my kids have two or three each and can stop their fighting !	1
Love them so much I bought another set for my wife . The quality and construction far exceed my expectations considering the price . Sounds like I 'm in a symphony hall .	1
I got this for my 6 year old and since she is 6 she doesnt exactly take good care of things but so far they still work Very happy with them	1
Dude ! These headphones are awesome ! First , I am not a big Panasonic fan , and I normally do n't buy this companies products.I found these in my friends closet , and I need a pair so I tried these , I thought they would be junk , THEY ARE AWESOME ! The bass is very good , and the sound is clear . Normally with lots of bass , the sound is crap . This is an even level of both . Also , they fit very well on your head , not tight , just snug , seems to even drown some exterior sound out . =DI go to BigLots mostly for my headphones , and I spend $ 10- $ 15 for headphones that are crap . This is a good deal , on Amazon.I am buying some now , I ca n't wait to get them ! Very happy with my find .	1
I ordered this to replace a headphone I have at my desk at work . The sound is pretty good for a $ 5 headphone . It 's no beats by Dre , but the Bass is decent , and the mid and high levels sound well balanced . They are very light and confortable , and sound better than the in-ear headphones that came with my Iphone . I have n't seen or heard of anything better for $ 5 . I think you would have to buy in the $ 20-30+ range to beat these . Again just some good cheap headpones .	1
I have always enjoyed SONY headphones , but these are a great value for the price . They are not noise-cancelling , which I wanted , since I use them when walking about the city , so I desire to hear some street noise for safety 's sake . Yet the sound quality is superb , and the fit is comfortable .	1
These have about 60 to 65 % the sound quality of my Sennheiser HD555 for about 5 % the price . Of course I do miss the other 35 to 40 % but for my Zune HD these work well at the gym where I would look silly with my HD555 .	1
i always had trouble with the ear-bud type so I was on the look-out for a reasonably priced pair of headphones.This one meets my needs completely ; now i can watch my videos comfortably propped up in bed without disturbing my early-sleeper husband .	1
I wanted to buy inexpensive headphones that worked fairly well and I would not be upset if they got lost or broken . These fit that objective perfectly . They work very well listening to Pandora on my Kindle Fire . They are lightweight and comfortable and about a hundred times better than the throw away types you get on the plane.The only problem now is I will be very disappointed if they get lost or broken !	1
The headphones arrived safely and promptly . They are a nice set of small earphones with a good head size adjustment mechanism and the sound is equal on both sides .	1
Not sure why so many 5 star reviews . They work okay . For the price I 'd buy them again ( $ 3 ) no question . They are cheap headphones that you 'd expect to get with an old Walkman or hand held CD player .	1
I did n't want to shell out much money for classroom headphones . These fit the kids well and sound good . I 'll be buying some more for home and the classroom .	1
Using this with my Ipod and it works great . I do a lot of photography , especially nature , and it 's great to be able to put on the headphones and listen to music while I work .	1
This a decent headset for the price . It is somewhat comfortable and appears to be durable . I bought 2 just in case .	1
I own several pair and have owned several pairs of headphones . These rank up there with my very expensive headphones as far as sound quality goes in a small package . Of course you are not going to beat the big bulky head phones that fit snug on your ears though . These headphones do n't hurt your ears after a long time using them like those in-ear ( ear buds ) do either . I would not use these head phones for working out though as the tend to slip off of your head . The more you sweat and move the more they slip . It is very bothersome when you are using cables and you lean forward and your headphones slide off of your head and hang while you are in the middle of your set . Bottom line : If you are just going to walk or sit and listen to your headphones you can not beat these headphones ... especially for the money - you just ca n't . Now if you are going to workout or do anything that causes movement and sweating , even yard work , then go with something like the Philips SH390 ( inexpinsive around $ 13.00 ) that are snug . Again , you can not beat the Panasoni RP-HT21 for the price - just be worned if you attempt to work out with them .	1
Nice product . It is working very well from past 1 year . Exceeds the expectation . Sound quality is very gud . Full satisfaction	1
I wanted these for the kids to use when playing the Xbox360 . They work great . They are lightweight , have very good sound quality and are inexpensive . It 's a great value item !	1
excellent product and i seeno need for further eloquence on this matter at this time and thats all folks amen	1
For the price , they 're stupid good ! Nice balance , light and unassuming , surprisingly decent sound , balance and bass.No noise canceling , but I would n't expect any from this size , price and design.Well worth it !	1
Pros : CheapExcellent voice quality and build quality.Good fit for ear and head.Cons : Two wire chords for each side.No extra cushion pad.On full volume sound leaks and nearby people can hear.Overall value buy for five bucks .	1
To be brief , I have owned my set of Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones for nearly a year and I have used them quite a lot , and I can attest to their excellent sounds , durability , and comfort . For less than $ 5.00 they are a terrific bargain and I would recommend them to anyone without reservation ! Two thumbs , way , way up !	1
These are a great price for the purposes I need - just to silence the speakers during other family members sleep time or when they are watching TV.Comfortable to wear , lighweight , easy on the ears , descent sound , long cords.No negatives so far .	1
The only reason why you would need this now is to get that same retro feel on 3dfx / Glide games that you have on an old rig where Direct3D just does n't feel the same ! IF you buy this product new it was the best of its time ! The only downfall that you MIGHT have are the GPU fans ( x2 ) that come with the card . They can be somewhat unreliable from what I hear BUT I STILL have this card in my legacy rig and the original fans are still running so I would n't worry about it so much . Just make sure to keep up with the maintenance and check your fans regularly like you should and you wo n't have a problem !	1
I am quite pleased with my new Bushnell Falcon 7x35 binoculars . They are very light and very easy to use . I am upgrading from a compact 10x25 set . I use them mostly for birdwatching . I recommend this set to anyone interested in birding .	1
The binoculars are well made . They are very easy to focus , and good for viewing animals , sports events , and scenery . I would recommend them to someone who needs a basic pair .	1
We bought these binoculars for our trip to Gettysburg this summer and I know that we will greatly enjoy using them ! They seem to be just what we needed !	1
This binocular is really nice . Sharp , easy to focus but , best of all , very bright image . I gambled on the junk Vivitar 7x50s for slightly less and they were a joke -- hard to focus , very dark image . So I bought this bushnell for barely a ten spot more money . Wow , very bright image , focus dead on and easy . As others have said , this is all the binocular a casual user will need . My wife 's 10x25 Nikon for twice the price ( also on Amazon ) are very nice and light weight especially if you need more power . But these Bushnell 's are the best value for sure . Bright and clear .	1
It works like how binoculars should work . It 's lets you see far and clear and has a good grip to it .	1
The game is great for a variety of reasons - it teaches kids addition and subtraction in a fun way , rolling the dice is fun for smaller kids who are n't there yet to count , and it also teaches kids to deal with winning and not winning ( we do n't use losing as a term at home - just our little positive reinforcement thing ) . The game makes is fun and children learn without feeling that they are sitting down to learn something . Quality of the game in terms of hte board , dice , and pieces is great too .	1
After being on the waiting list at Amazon for 2 months and also shopping elsewhere for the 3Com Palm IIIe , I was plain old fed up ! I was n't willing to spend the extravagant prices for the higher end Palm Pilots ( which seem to be the only ones 3Com will produce in abundance ! ) . I ran across the Handspring Visor at Amazon and decided to take a chance . I LOVE IT ! After comparing it to a friends Palm III , I do n't see a difference worth mentioning here . It is fully compatible with the Palm so why wait ! The only small pieve I have is you have to shop at Amazon or Handspring for accessories and/or replacement parts !	1
my only regret is i should have bought the ice model rather than the blue ... sadly after only a few years of service , this gadget packed up . lost all my data . very annoying . decided not to replace it , too .	1
The sync w/Outlook is seamless . The basic Pocket Mirror software sync 's up your Inbox , Outbox , Deleted , Draft , and Filed ( did n't investigate Filed yet ) . Unless you keep all the mail you need in your Inbox folder you will be disappointed . The upgrade to Pocket Mirror promises more , and- who knows ? - maybe the Filed folder on the basic version holds the answer.I will say that the unit is a bit slow at times , which probably also explains the difficulty in convincing alarms to stop . I 've found that moving the stylus over a broad area of the screen button seems to help , but often that only serves to get the application 's attention , and you are still left to tap the button again to actually modify the alarm time.Speaking of alarms , the unit 's tiny speaker is a bit weak , especially when compared to my mobile phone . A bigger , more powerful speaker and/or perhaps a larger speaker opening would work wonders . I have ALL alarms set to high and struggle to hear the alarm at times . I keep the unit clipped to my belt but facing me , though the unit sits 1/2 & quot ; to 1 & quot ; away from my body , and the speaker is NOT obstructed by the belt clipped storage unit .	1
This PDA is attractive and very easy to use . I have already started to add software . I have one small caveat , more of an advisory . If you use Yahoo ! for online storage of your calendar , address book , etc . and use Intellisync for Yahoo ! to synchronize your online info and your Visor , you may not be able to use the proprietary software that comes with the Visor . I had a Rex 6000 and could use both its software and Yahoo 's . But that is apparently not the case with the Visor . This is not a major drawback for me but if you use and like Yahoo ! , you should keep it in mind .	1
The device is perfect . It is what all Palm Pilot devices aspired to become . I am still looking for the remainders of the family of devices and accessories .	1
First of all , the applications available on a palm operating system are great . And the Visor is a good vehicle to access these apps . -- like the Palm . The ONE thing I did n't pick up in my research that MAY be pertinent is that the Visor requires regular battery replacements . The Palm ( I think starting with the V ) has rechargeable batteries that are juiced by the synch cradle . I change my Visor 's batteries every 3 weeks . Maybe no big deal if you have kids at home ( and lots of batteries ) but I find it a pain . Is it a $ 150 pain ? Probably not . But I wish I had known . . .	1
I brought two of these with my Visor Deluxe and it has saved my data once already after the Visor 's software hung on my and I had to do a hard reset.The module could not be easier to use - one click backup and restore.I was surprised though that backup and restore is & quot ; all or nothing & quot ; - you ca n't select what to backup or restore . That means it 's really only useful in the case of complete system failure when you have to revert to a previous state .	1
Extremely simple to use . Once taken out of the box , snap on , and you 're ready to do your first backup with a press of a onscreen button.My visor crashed several times and I had to do a hard reset ( loosing all data and software installed ) . But with this springboard , you can restore everything back with a click of & quot ; Restore & quot ; button .	1
While the Visor is a stable product , it is possible to completely confuse it and end up losing all of your data.I did it while trying to wirelessly synchronize with Omnisky and I ended up losing all of my data by doing a hard reser ( starts your Visor over from scratch ) .The first time , it was quite a blow because I had to reinstall everything . The next day I ordered this product and when it arrived I immediately made a backup.I am thinking about getting two of these items , one for a baseline backup of my system and one for my everyday backup of essential information.It is quick and easy , when you insert it into the slot the Visor loads the program and prompts you for action . You simply click on the icon that identifies backup or restore and it does the rest . When it is done you can remove the module and everything is back to normal .	1
Used these in a calculator for more than four years , and just replaced them - with same brand , of course ... .	1
I purchased this battery to replace a defective one for an old Triplett 310 voltmeter . The battery could have been purchased locally , but I needed to purchase a 15 volt battery also and ordered them both at the same time . This was an easy decision as the N battery was much cheaper on line .	1
The delivery service was fast , the product is just as described , and the price is superb ! I definitely recommend buying from this seller .	1
It 's not the batteries that I like most about this product . Since batteries are pretty much all the same . I liked this product because in a singe package it contains to two CR-2 lithium Photo Batteries . Since I bought my Minolta SLR camera from Amazon.com , which require two batteries , this would be a better , and cheaper choice . Plus it 's great for the Environment too .	1
Standard battery in a 2-pack . Full voltage ( unlike those sold for $ 1 each and which would not power the light and laser in my pistol gunsight ) .	1
.I bought one of these for my girlfriend to use with her Xmas present -- a Visor Platinum . The combination is outstanding.The Visor is a little too fat to slide in a pocket like my Palm 3xe , but for a woman with a purse , or a man with a suit pocket , this is ideal.It is sharp looking , and has room for a few business or credit cards . The Platinum is a gorgeous PDA . This leather case make it look even sharper and more professional.The leather pouch that comes with the Platinum provides good protection , but does n't cut it for everyday use.This fold-out leather case is the one to get.Conrad B .

This is a no-brainer to install and use . Just put the CD in and connect the cable . Put the card in and double click the icon and a couple of folders . From then on it 's just like using any other files . You can rename , select all , copy , delete , whatever ... .I 'm using mine with a 32mb SanDisk and Fujifilm finepix 1400 camera . After your done uploading to your pc , you can just select all files on the card and delete . A clean disk goes back into your camera . There were no software conflicts for me . In fact , I deleted the software that came with the camera .	1
This is our most recent Smart Media card and we have had no compatibility issues with it . We 've been using the card for a year now with no problems in the following devices : Toshiba PDR-M60 digital cam , Lexar card reader , Dazzle card reader . The 64MB card holds something like 200 pictures at the highest quality in our 2 megapixel camera , so we have been more than satisified . If you 've got a 3 megapixel or higher digital camera or you 're using it to store tunes , I recommend jumping up to the 128MB Viking card . These are great cards at very reasonable prices .	1
Well , it has been four years since I purchased the 64 MB SmartMedia Card , and it is still working great with noe `` Error Card '' messages . I estimate it has been erased and re-used at least 100 times during the last four years with no issues . A great card.The media card is working great with the Olympus 3000 . No problems , no issues , just some great photos . With my 12 year old son , he likes to take the digital photos and if it does n't turn out right ( he is getting better ) , the photo gets deleted . The media card has shown no ill effect to the massive amount of deletes and adds that the media card had put up with.A great way to let a young future photographer to practice and learn by the mistakes made WITHOUT having to wait for the photo ( and COST ) to get developed to get feedback .	1
Using this with my Canon A50 allows me to take approximately 280 photos before I have to change cards . Have used it for almost a year without any problems . Great value !	1
I 'm a much bigger fan of the Targus folding keyboard . For starters it folds into the size of a handspring . Second of all the Landware version 's keys are incredibly small . The one feature benefit of landware is that it 's a rigid design so it can be used on your lap - while the Targus version is very flexible and needs to be placed on a flat surface to type .	1
The Fujifilm FinePix 1400 Zoom digital still camera is a sleek and handsome device styled with a familiar & quot ; point-and-shoot camera & quot ; sort of design . Controls are reasonably well laid-out and fairly easy to handle , even for middle-aged hands and thick fingers like mine.For the record , this is my first digital camera . I regard myself as an & quot ; intermediate & quot ; amateur in 35mm film photography , and desktop computer operations.Though I have not yet made any prints from the digital images I have taken with this camera , I am very well satisfied with the color and sharpness in the daylight macro images taken in my rose garden as I view them on my iMac . The attempt to photograph my nephews ' graduation from the bleachers of a high school gymnasium , however , revealed the limitations of the modest built-in flash , and the lens ' ability to pick up & quot ; ghosts & quot ; of the overhead lighting.The camera can take pictures in your choice of three quality levels ( basic , normal , or fine ) and one of two pixel sizes ( 640x480 or 1280x960 ) . A 320x240 file size can accomplished by editing a recorded image using the & quot ; resize & quot ; function . Indeed , any larger size can be reduced to a smaller size ( to the minimum 320x240 ) . This can save space on the SmartMedia card , or reduce transmission time over internet email , for instance.The camera comes with one 4MB SmartMedia card . According to the owners manual , the & quot ; standard & quot ; number of 1280x960 images which can be recorded in 4MB ranges from 6 & quot ; fine & quot ; to 12 & quot ; normal & quot ; to 23 & quot ; basic ; & quot ; and the number of 640x480 images ranges from 23 & quot ; fine & quot ; to 44 & quot ; normal & quot ; to 69 & quot ; basic & quot ; . The manual goes on to say that actual capacity & quot ; varies slightly depending on the type of subject. & quot ; The highly recommended purchase of a 32MB card increases 1280x960 & quot ; standard & quot ; capacity to 50 & quot ; fine , & quot ; 99 & quot ; normal , & quot ; and 180 & quot ; basic & quot ; images ; and 640x480 & quot ; standard & quot ; capacity to 180 & quot ; fine , & quot ; 330 & quot ; normal , & quot ; and 496 & quot ; basic & quot ; images.An indoor flash picture of a furnished room revealed some barely detectable & quot ; jaggies & quot ; along the edges of a lamp shade in the & quot ; normal & quot ; mode . Switching to & quot ; fine & quot ; eliminated these altogether . ( BTW , in a normal-size room , the flash exposure was ample . ) I must agree with the many reviewers who have written that the LCD display is a bit too small and not bright enough to see easily in full sunlight , but I have found that a & quot ; banker 's visor & quot ; or & quot ; big bubba & quot ; billed cap can help.The optical viewfinder is another solution , and is especially useful because it actually & quot ; zooms & quot ; along with the lens in pseudo-SLR fashion . But unlike a true thru-the-lens viewer , the parallax error in this camera is significant . Because the & quot ; film & quot ; does not & quot ; see & quot ; exactly the same & quot ; frame & quot ; as the optical viewfinder , you might end up cutting off Aunt Mildred 's head in that next photo if you do n't take care.The camera manuals , though they still sound a bit & quot ; translated , & quot ; are actually very informative , well organized , and well thought-out . The installation of the software drivers , and downloading over the USB interface to my iMac with MacOS 8.6 went without a hitch.Besides a larger SmartMedia card , other recommendable additions include one ( or better yet , two ) full sets of rechargeable batteries with recharger . And , if you plan to spend time using the in-camera editing features , consider getting the AC adapter , too.Playback functions include a nice nine-image LCD & quot ; thumbnail & quot ; display mode . And those with advanced interests might want to take advantage of the camera 's ability to edit various Digital Print Order Format ( DPOF ) settings.My verdict on the Fujifilm FinePix 1400 Zoom is that it is a very good value as an entry-level digital camera capable ( within reasonable limits ) of capturing excellent images for computer viewing . In today 's marketplace , there are but two or three that can directly compete with it for price and features - especially for owners of USB equipped computers .	1
Very Likely Your First Lens Will Be This One ... They Are Incorperated Into Most Of The Canon Kits Available Today , And Why Not ? ... It Features The Most Popular Focal Lenghts ... From Wide Angle To Telephoto , This Zoom Lens Gives You The Best Of Both Worlds ... The Apature Is Kind Of Limited , But For A Starter Lens , This Is Great ...	1
this lens offer a really good photos , but it needs a good light , is well to take pictures with day light , at night is not so good . It 's ok for the price , perfect for wildlife pictures .	1
I also want to rate the seller 5 stars . Quick shipment , nice packaging and brand new product.When I first saw it , it was not as good as 18-135 mm lens on my Canon 60D in building and look . However , it does its job well in terms of the light weight and price . The quality of pictures are acceptable as well . I am happy to have it .	1
I am a great photographer and I am using a Canon t3 with this Lens I see a little bit of a difference and I do recommend it to whoever need an extra lens	1
As a novice photographer it 's easy to get caught up in the cost of the all equipment one may want or need . Great equipment costs a lot . This lens is great compromise . I never thought I would need a telephoto zoom , but Amazon made it an easy decision to purchase when with a discount for buying a new camera brought the cost to $ 30 . I 'm glad I jumped at the chance . Even at full price , this lens is a great value for its construction and capabilities . This is definitely the next lens to step up from the kit lens . With the proper person , the proper camera , lens hood and filters , this lens takes fantastic images . Images from the dog show this weekend are visually stunning . If you feel that you can have good camera control with a steady hand ( as this lens lacks image stability ) , and you are looking for a great entry level telephoto zoom lens , then this lens is a fantastic choice . Thanks Amazon and Canon for helping me take some photos that will last a lifetime .	1
I am on a budget college student who picked an expensive hobby ! I 've been looking for a decent zoom lense for an offordable price for awhile and decided to give this one a shot . I can honestly say that I am not at all disapointed . Although you cant compare it to a $ 500-700 lense with IS ; look at the price . If you are on budget like me and looking for a decent lense , this one will get the job done . I found that at 300mm it get a little blury if you dont use the tripod , but still this lense give an exceptional images . I love to go to a park and sneak up on birds , very happy with the quality . I hope my experience help some of you . My advice is do a little research because what is good for other people maynot be right for you . Happy shooting !	1
This lens without I.S . is useless without a tripod . There is no way to hold it steady at this magnification . I did have it on a tripod for what I was shooting and it Produced beautiful results .	1
I only use Canon lenses . I trust the quality and accuracy . This lens is no exception . It is easy to use , easy to adjust and brings in beautiful pictures . This one is especially good for long distance objects like the moon or mountains .	1
Great for all sorts of stuff , especially at taking pictures . Have n't used it for a game of toss yet . Word .	1
I bought this lens about six months after replacing my 20 year old SLR with the Canon Rebel G. I did n't think photography could get any better . It did.The first day I used this lens , I was shooting photos of a biplane plummeting at an airshow . Having been used to my older equipment , I thought , & quot ; No way can I hold 300mm still enough , but what the heck , film is cheap. & quot ; I was wrong . That photo was crystal clear , and instead of a tiny blur in the midst of sky , I have a very clear image of the plane filling the frame.The lens has been responsible for getting me up close in many places since , most recently capturing Al Gore and his entourage on the pilot house of the riverboat that travelled the Mississippi the day after the convention . If you are looking for a versatile lens that gives great results under many conditions , this is it . It really is hard to take a bad photo when using it .	1
Hard to hate on the lens . Functions well I can see the field up close event with I am sitting in the nosebleeds .	1
I 'm just a hobbyist . I like to take pictures for fun . Maybe a more serious photographer would have problems with image quality ; maybe not ! I do n't know ! All I know is that this lens works great and gives me photos that I love . I recommend it wholeheartedly .	1
Clarity and ease of use are exceptional - wonderful for closing the gaps from where you are and the subject is . Purchased this lens as part of my self made package when I purchased my Rebel T3	1
Thank you for this lens , I got a lot of shot for Inauguration Ceremonies on January 21 , 2013 for our President OBAMA 2nd turn , I had been down there from the 18 of January 2013 to the 22 , 2013 .	1
I purchased this lens with my minimalist budget in mind , and I must say that for the money , it is n't too bad . It lacks a fancy focus motor ( i.e . USM ) , which makes it a bit slow and noisy , but you ca n't find a more inexpensive long distance telephoto lens . It is perfect for the amateur photographer without a lot of money .	1
This is a good lens for the price . I ended up getting the nicer version of this so I will no longer use it , but it is still a great lens !	1
I guess the universe sensed how much I really wanted a 300mm lens . I would always search for sales and just dreamed . But how can I afford one of these lenses ? Then one day , this guy popped up for $ 100.00 ... Canon yet ! Sure it was & # 34 ; Used & # 34 ; but for $ 100.00 , it was worth a try . This was more within my budget and I am very , very happy and grateful !	1
I am not new to Canon lens ' so I was not surprised to know I was getting a great product . Sure there are more expensive and better overall lens but this one will fit your need if your just a amateur/hobbyist like me . Never a issue one time .	1
This lens have really delivered the versatility it promised . I have taken pictures of my friend , who is my neighbor , from about 100 yards away and the quality of the picture was as if I was within 10 feet of him . Its a nice lens and I would recommend it to anyone who doubts the amount of satisfaction they will receive from their investment.Otto G .	1
I 've used both this lens and the 55-250mm canon , and I 've stuck to the 55-250 for a few reasons ... 1 . Chromatic Aberrations - the 75-300 has a lot of it , the 55-250 not so much.2 . size - the 75-300 is a big lens , not really easy to work with . The focal length is also a bit weird , the 55-250 is perfect for crop sensor cameras.3 . IS - the 75-300 does n't have it , the 55-250 does . At long focal lengths IS is a must.I use my 55-250 for portraits and wildlife , and I had used the 75-300 for wildlife/macro , and honestly , if you know how to use the lens it will work well , the only thing that got me away from it was the color fringing ( aberrations ) when doing macro.Should you buy it ? if you have the extra cash , get the 55-250 IS . If not , you can buy this and you should be happy .	1
I bought this lens soon after I got my Rebel XT , so I did n't know much about lenses . Now that I have been using it for about a year and have since learned a little more about photography , I kind of wish that I had bought the IS version or maybe even one of the higher quality ( and much more expensive ) L versions . I 'm no pro but even I can tell that it becomes pretty soft at the long end . Plus the front element rotates which can be a problem when using a circular polarizing filter . As mentioned in other reviews , the use of a tripod can go a long way in helping to minimize the need for IS but a tripod is not always practical . Plus , when I bought it , I did n't anticipate that I would use it as frequently as I have ( though I still use my regular zoom more often ) . But despite its weaknesses , it 's still a pretty good lens , especially for the money . It has allowed me to get many shots I would not have been able to get otherwise , and with decent image quality . If you 're truly budget-minded and just want the extra reach for fun , then this would be a good choice . However , if your serious ( or plan to be ) , and can afford it , I would go with something a little higher quality .	1
Although somewhat limited in that you only have two F-stops : f/4 and f/5.6 , ; you have five focal lengths you can choose from : 75mm , 100mm , 135mm , 200mm , and 300mm making it a lens you can use for portriats or landscapes .	1
This is a good lens , however it does suffer from chromatic abberations ! Which if you use adobe light room can be fixed . Sharpness is good though even at 300mm . Which is more than I can say for the $ 400 Nikkor 55-300 vr that I bought for my Nikon camera ! If you have a little time to invest in photo editing this lens does just fine !	1
have been able to take great zoom shots on my eos 7d even though it is not an is lens .	1
One of my co-workers got a pair of these from Amazon today . Wow ! We stood at the window of our 24th floor office and read the menu of a hot-dog cart on a corner a block and a half away.What really clinches it ( and made it possible to read the hot-dog cart menu ) is the image stabilization . If you have a high magnification , any minor shake of your hand is magnified . Try it with a video camera with one of thos high digital zooms . When you 're at 100x , even the electronic image stabilization ca n't compensate just for the average minor muscle twitches in your hand.The image stabilization on this is optical ( i.e . analog ) , not digital , meaning there 's no fuzzing of the image as a processor tries to adjust the image to compensate for vibration . Optical zoom and optical stabilization require more expensive mechanical components to implement , thus you 'll see mid-range video cameras offering their digital counterparts to enhance or substitute for optical zooms and stabilizers.Given , these binoculars will set you back a pretty penny , but you could go to a ball game , sit in the nosebleeds and count the laces on the ball . Definitely a very cool thing for the gadget-oriented .	1
Simply Amazing ! Great field of view and easy focus . Best binoculars I have ever used . I have used regular 18x50 binoculars in the past and always found it challenging to hold the image steady watching sporting events . The stabilization feature is terrific . The rock solid image is definitely worth the cost .	1
Great optics . Surprisingly bright and excellent for star gazing . I can actually see the moons of Jupiter with them.Issues- Protective caps do n't stay on.. ever- Sucks up batteries pretty quickly- A bit heavyStill 5 stars . One of my all-time favorite expensive purchases . [ update ] To get caps to stay on , purchase UV filters for the lens . These lens fit standard camera filters size 52mm . Then the caps fit nicely . Also , protects the lens from accidental scratches .	1
This is the other lens I got when I bought my Canon body ( the main one being a 35-80 ) . It lasted me a long time , especially when you drop a tele-convertor into the mix . It is most definately an amateur lens . Do n't expect poster sharp results . But then , look at the price . You get what you pay for and for what you pay for this lens you get a great deal . I 've since upgraded to a 75-300 and passed this lens on to a friend who also loves it . If you can afford the extra ( about ( $ ) more ) I 'd recommend the 75-300 for extra range . If not , I 've no complaints about this lens.As an added bonus , if you get the other 'starter ' lens , the 35-80 , the filter screw size is the same so you 'll need to buy fewer filters as they will be usable on both lenses .	1
Who needs ANOTHER cleaning kit ? This one does it all . Very handy lens cleaning tool easily used to remove dust , fingerprints , smudges , etc . from your lenses . Buy two - one for the camera bag and one for the home . A must have .	1
A great way to keep your lens/camera clean and ready for that perfect shot !	1
What a workhorse , we bought the Oly C-3000z around the end of 2000 and , until very recently , have used it at least a few times a week ( almost every week ) in our shop for product pictures . With a resolution of 3.2mp , this camera takes pictures that are still good for web pages and most advertising flyers and prints we produce.It might seem odd to be writing a review for a camera this old , but we are about to retire this one from the shop ( replacing it withFujifilm Finepix F70EXR 10MP Super CCD Digital Camera with 10x Optical Triple Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD ) and give it to one of my kids as a beater camera . I noticed that several of these cameras were being sold on Amazon as used ( but not by me ) , and wanted to let people know that it is possible for there to be `` life '' in a camera this old.Here are my general observations ( +/- ) : + Good Lens - 3x Optical Zoom- Shows `` Purple Fringing '' in some cases+ Good Solid Body - Feels good in the hand- Bad Lens Cap - Replaced mine with a 3rd party one that is no longer made+ Good Movie Mode w/Sound - A nice feature when this camera was made- Uses SmartMedia Cards - Fairly low capacity , getting harder to find , and many computers require usb adapters to read them+ Great Macro Mode - Very good for our product pictures+ Remote Control - Suports a remote control , which is important for tripod shots in low lightWe have taken 1000s of pictures with this camera , including two award winning photos , and it likely will take many more.Highly recommended !	1
After having a great time with a cheaper digital camera - a Sony DSC-S30 1.3 Megapixel - I decided to trade up to one of the 3+ megapixel cameras . I did extensive research comparing the top cameras , read countless reviews on photo websites , consumer reviews , etc . The other cameras that I was seriously considering was the coolpix 990 and the Sony DSC-S70 . I finally decided on the C3000 because it was such a bargain . If you want to have the flexibility of being creative with your photography , the C3000 has almost as much as the 990 . It has manual , Aperture Priority , Shutter Priority , Manual focus , and exposure bracketing to name a few . But it takes damn nice auto-exposure pictures as well . You get a rapid fire mode , which , though not blazingly fast , is still respectable and even increases quite a bit with focus set to manual . Another great feature lets you annotate pictures with a 4-second audio clip , kind of an audio labeling . There other cameras out there , notably the Cannon Powershot G1 , which has more features including one I really would have loved - a flexible LCD which is invaluable for taking candid shots . But the G1 has image problems ( Chromatic Aberations and noise ) , as does the 990 ( redeye ) . All these cameras have plusses and minuses , but with one of the top-rated images and top-rated feature-set with a price that 's a couple hundred lower than most of the top cameras , the C3000 really stands out !	1
I got my x700 when I was 16 and heading out for Philmont . That was 22 years ago . In that time , I have had it serviced twice ... both times for a cleaning ... and both times for around $ 25 . Not a bad service life . My camera has been all over europe , spelunking , on mountains , snowmobiles , dive trips , and just about any other place electronic equipment is unsuitable . It has never let me down . It has photographed the births of both our children as well as a number of weddings . I have reluctantly set aside my x700 for a new flashy Nikon which is lighter and digital ... but there is NO way it could ever be half as durable as the Minolta . It is built like a tank ... it has the heft and quality feel of a good Maglite . I also recommend dropping the cash and popping the MD1 motordrive unit on it . You might as well . Everything is availabe cheap these days . It is still an impressive head turning unit in this configuration . It has served me well for 22+ years ... and I will keep it around for times when I am wary about the abuse a dSLR can handle . My x700 has never `` crashed '' from being too cold , too hot , too rough . It never complains ... and the pictures are always beautiful .	1
I bought the minolta x-570 to use for my photography class in school . turned out to be one great camera ! i love that I can use any minolta lens on my sony a65 so it works awesome . light weight body , with great features with a cheap price . recommend using the ilford 400 film .	1
This is not a high end unit but it works great for camping and road trips with other cars in your group . I really like the weather channel . I only use the cigarette lighter for power because this thing will go through batteries like Obama through your tax dollars . Very quick delivery ,	1
I take great pride in my ability to write quickly using the Visor 's built-in handwriting recognition software . But I can type a heck of a lot faster than I can scribble , so I use this keyboard whenever I can . It folds up into a package about the same size as my Visor Prism , which is twice the thickness of the Visor Platinum . If you need to enter a lot of data , this is the only way to go .	1
I think that this works very well ... but it can be a bit picky to connect to your visor ... its not really hard but lining up the unit and the keyboard requires some maneuvering sometimes ... and i can see how you could just *knock* off the connecting pins ... i used it a few times on my lap instead of a desk and it doesnt seem to to lie stragt now , even on a desk . i am not sure if its cause i used it on a not flat surface or after time it just doesnt *connect* as effecently and isnt as flat ... but it is a bit of a pain.. also i had a time when i had to call the support line ( who were very helpful by the way ) it seems that it works best if you connect the unit when the visor is off and than turn it on ... so the drivers load.Sometimes the drivers will not load if you connect the keyboard to a visor that is *on* ... it seems if the visor is on and you connect sometimes the keyboard wont work and you wont know why ... this seems a bit picky and a reel pain in a meeting.ON THE OTHER HAND ... . it is way easier than using graffiti..or the on screen keyboard ... it makes the visor MUCH more useful for taking notes , putting in data ... addresses..etc There are many more keyboards on the market now than when i bought mine and i would check them all out ... but besides these few things mine has been working well for as long as they have been out	1
One of the annoyances of the Visor is the lack of implicit support for Ir synching . I 'm a big fan of USB , but it would be even better if I did n't need to carry any extra hardware at all.I lived for over a year with a Palm , and immediately dropped the cradle in favor of a cable . This was the first accessory I purchased for my Visor . Unlike the Visor itself , and the rip-off belt clip , this seems to be a very high quality product . It snicks securely into the base of the Visor , and is easily removed by grasping both sides of the connector , which releases two pins on the inside of the connector.Many have complained about the difficulty of using the Handspring cradle . Take heart , this is an easy in and out every time -- it provides positive indication of physical connection . The cable rolls up neatly and fits into a laptop bag.If you have only used a cradle before , it may take you a couple of minutes to get used to a cable . It does n't have a button . When you synch , you 'll need to turn on your Visor and tap the HotSync icon ( mine 's on the System menu ) . Then click on the LocalSync icon . Other than this minor loss of convenience , it works just like the cradle.Handspring support claims that it is possible to do an Ir synch , but I had already failed at the procedure they suggested : buy the commercial IrLink software and download the latest desktop software from Palm . If you do want to try this , beware that the Palm software does n't support USB . If you want to experiment with this before purchasing the USB HotSync Cable , you do n't have to worry about losing data when uninstalling and reinstalling different Palm Desktops and HotSync Managers -- I went back and forth several times , and my data and configuration were not changed . Once you 're thoroughly frustrated with that , buy the USB cable .	1
I bought this product after some friends of mine recommended it to me . It took me less than 30 minutes to get evenrything up and running . I have 3 PCs and a laptop and I now have internet access from all the m/cs . Very simple configurations and easy to set up and works great ! I highly recommend it .	1
I ordered this camera and received it not even a week ago . I have seen photo 's on the internet but believe me..there is nothing like the real thing ! This one truly makes you fall in love with it the first time you see it.When you buy this cam ... also get an extra battery , flash card and protective case . Many tips has already been said in these reviews so I 'm going to add to it . One review said that the person had tremendous trouble installing the software on a Win98 platform . My first installation was succesfull . I used Win98 second edition to help with the installation . Something you should keep in mind . The SP100 only supports USB transferring of data to your PC . So you need a USB port attatched to your motherboard . The latest boards has a USB port . But the older ones ( which is not that long ago ! ) does not have a port and you have to buy a USB card to plug into your motherboard . I had to do that.The rest of the installation and connection to the camera is mind blowing easy and quickly ! Downloading photo 's to your pc is like saying 1,2,3.Then something another reviewer said . Sometimes the photo 's tend to be a bit dark . Quite true . But you CAN force the flash to stay on . You also can set the flash on Slow-Syncro mode which adjusts itself to the slow shutter speeds . You can also set the exposure compensation and the white balance.There are a few more things the cam can do . I will name some of them . Shooting continuously , ( 2 images per second until you release the button ) , a timer ( takes a photo after 10 seconds ) , shooting close-ups , stitch photo 's together , replay images on your TV ( realy cool ) , and taking black and white photo's.The software is okay ... nothing to rave about ! What would I like to see improoved ... ..definetely the zoom capabilities ! ! But overall ... a beauty !	1
I like the smaller size of this label tape , it makes a veryprofessional looking label , which can be used on a varietyof objects . None of these tapes are inexpensive , but theresults are impressive .	1
This RED on WHITE tape is my favorite . It STANDS out and is easy to read from a distance . If you need something NOTICED . This is the tape to use.The finish is very professional and one applied it stays STUCK ! Now , if only it would GLOW in the dark..then I would be ecstatic !	1
lots of power , easy to hack/tweak.I will never put it in my camera hot shoe anyway , I use them with remotes ( Cactus V4 to be specific )	1
I 've had this flash about a month now . I 've been pretty happy with it and it does everything I need to do with an off camera flash . Great price .	1
I 'm going to briefly describe my level of photography before I dive into this review to put this into context ( if you do n't care about context just skip to the next paragraph ) . I 've been into photography for two years . During that time I 've been `` bitten by the shutterbug '' as they say , and I 've devoted myself to photography : pouring over dozens of books , thousands of articles , and countless images learning the art . I 'm relatively new to strobist photography ; I got an SB900 for Christmas and since then I 've fallen in love with off-camera flash . This Vivitar 285 HV is my second flash unit . The camera I primarily use is a Nikon D300.REVIEW : It 's clear this flash is from a different era ( The instruction manual is Copyright 1985 ) . At one point in the instruction manual it says something the long the lines of `` try shooting a roll of film to experiment with this feature . '' As such , there is no iTTL/eTTL . *GASP* You 'll actually have to decide the proper exposure for yourself . As my technique improves and I gain more experience with off-camera flash , I noticed that I relied less and less on the SB900 's TTL capabilities . I 'd shoot manual at the camera and manual on the flash.As I said before , this flash is old , but it feels like a workhorse in your hands . With a solid build and sturdy mounts I 've read reviews of people who have been using a Vivitar 285 HV for 15+ years and it keeps slugging away.The power of this cheap flash is incredibly powerful . I 've done an experiment comparing the flash output of the SB900 to the Vivitar 285HV , and I must say I 'm quite impressed ( please see this link for the test : [ ... ] ) It 's pretty clear that with the extra $ 300 you 'd drop for an SB900 you 're paying for the optical slave , and the fancy iTTL electronics . Buy this flash .	1
I could only give this Vivitar four stars because it does everything very well , but it takes a LOT of practice to learn how to use it WELL ! Once one learns how to use it , it is a really useful all-round flash and a good addition to a multi-flash system . Considering the price , well worth it .	1
Vivitar 285HV Auto Professional FlashThis is an amazing inexpensive flash that rivals OEM dedicated equipment.Yet it is not ETTL but just because of that it gives you a full control over what you are doing . I really like it ( as well as uncounted number of photographers in the last 30 years ) . I only wish it came with a power adapter .	1
I bought this vivitar 285hv flash for off-camera lighting , and it worked great with the Pt-04 wireless flash trigger set I have . The SB-600 I have will go into standby mode in a minute or two if I do n't use it . This Vivitar flash wo n't , and that 's a good thing because I do n't have to wake it up . It is always up and ready to be fired . It may use more power that way , but I do n't care since I have a lot of rechargeable AA batteries ready . Great flash ! ! !	1
Who uses film these days , right ? Fugi film is clearly the best . Everyone knows that ! Love the product , takes photos like a dream .	1
Same great stuff I used to get in japan when shooting film . Fine grain , great color , and really forgiving . Ordered it along with a Canon Film rebel on here.Edit : I too received generic Fuji instead of the HQ , nonetheless still great film just a heads up . Not near to expiration like some people said they got . Mines good till 2014/03	1
Film is disappearing fast now . Just not economical to produce , stock and sell I guess . Digital is the thing now.This film is 800 ASA . It allows you to use higher shutter speeds and tighter apertures so you can get better pictures in lower light situations or to stop motion of a busy subject ( kids ) . I think the relative merits of different films and brands of film is becoming moot . ANY film you are able to find will be good film ! Get some now and keep it in your fridge for later .	1
I was pleasantly surprised as I delve back into film photography , at how flexible , colorful and grain-free is this Fujifilm Reala 800 ! I used it for the first time it in my modern Zeiss Ikon 35 mm super-gorgeous rangefinder w/ 50mm Planar f2.0 ; 8x10 enlargements showed zero grain and a wonderful almost 3D quality in the prints . I really am pleased with my results vs my digital equipment . In a nutshell : a little contrasty , beautiful color , sharp , really forgiving ( exposure ) no visible grain and a wonderful realistic 3D quality . Also handles indoor lighting really well without the funky green tint that I 've seen with other films . I have n't tried it outdoors ( may be pushing my luck ) but indoors it has been awesome !	1
My main reason for preferring this film is because , as far as color goes , this is rich color with a reasonably high ISO . I 'm not really that worried about grain since that 's part of the draw of shooting film nowadays ( at least it is for me ) .When I shoot on film , I use a Pentax ME Super without a flash , hence why I use ISO 800 , since when I 'm at f/2.8 I can shoot comfortably in a reasonably well lit room . And when I 'm shooting on overcast days , this film still keeps the pictures looking good.The final reason that this is most often in my camera ( if I 'm not shooting Kodak bw4oocn ) is because its affordable and readily available . Fuji makes great film and this is a solid performer for general use.My only concern is that I 've had some issues with the film being to tight and it some rolls have been a little hard to load or to catch on the winder ( its simply harder to pull out of the cassette ) . Half of that is user error , but it seems like I have to try more often to get this film to catch in the mechanism ( and in an point and shoot camera you probably wo n't notice if the film is n't actually advancing ) . Just be careful loading and it should all go smoothly .	1
I 'm not sure if you can still purchase APS cameras , but if you have one film is hard to come by . They do n't even sell it at the drug stores . If you use it I would say stock up no because with reduced demand and the fall of Kodak it could suffer the same fate as betamax .	1
what else can you say . it 's the same disposable super-wide-angle-lens , 800 ISO cameras you used for years before digital cameras , but waterproof .	1
We purchased these for our gift bags for a wedding because we were going on a Caribbean Cruise . Everyone loved them .	1
Bought this for my Grand-daughter who went to Florida , and she took it on her water skidoo , it got wet and still took great pics..would buy again .	1
I have gone to Jamicia 3 times in the last 3 years and each time I take the Fujifilm disposal with me . I have now used 9 individual cameras and have never had a problem . The color to me is fantastic , however the ocean is just a little more blue than real life which is not a problem for me . You take a picture by pushinig a lever and than wind a few turns to get to the next picture . The ease is slightly difficult as you are in a body of water trying to swim and focus at the same time , but i think you would have this problem with any camera.Over time I have spent as much on the disposable camera as I would have if I bought a new digital underwater camera and in hind site I think I made the right purchase .	1
The tapes are amazing . They came earlier than I thought they would . I have watched the tapes and the condition is perfect . I 'm so glad I bought these tapes . I will buy again .	1
TDK manufactures excellent six hour blank VHS tapes for all purpose general recording of audio-visual media . As long as you have the right kind of equipment , these tapes record television programs off TV or they can be used to make copies of a non-copyright protected VHS tape . These tapes have up to six hours worth of blank recording space ; and this is useful when recording television shows , for example.In addition , you can record onto these tapes using different speeds so that the tape records two hours worth recording time , four hours worth recording time and six hours worth of recording . ( You use your VCR to set this . ) The best image quality will be at two hours worth of recording time but many people say they 're satisfied with the image they get using the six hour recording time speed.The tapes allow you hours upon hours of viewing enjoyment because you record onto them over and over again countless times although after some use the picture quality will eventually begin to gradually deteriorate.Unfortunately , these tapes can not produce the same quality recording reproduction as a digitalized copy would give you . This means that if , hypothetically , you were to copy a DVD-R onto another DVD-R instead of a TDK blank VHS tape , the quality of the audio-visual media on the DVD-R copy would be sharper and clearer than a TDK tape or any other brand of video tape could give you . Moreover , VHS tapes can break if not handled with care . These shortcomings frustrate me and therefore I will have to take off one star to make this a four star review.The tapes have small pieces of plastic on the narrow front edge of each VHS tape which you can punch out easily so that accidental recording over an existing recording is impossible . If you do wish to record over an original recording then you can merely place a small amount of regular tape over the hole . The VHS tape is now ready to record a fresh recording.Overall , TDK makes a great choice when you want reliable blank VHS tapes to record television shows or anything else that you wish to record . I have used this brand for many years and I can not think of any major complaints . I highly recommend TDK six hour VHS tapes for you to use when you need to record something onto a VHS cassette tape .	1
im a record tv addict , i buy these often . great 4 movies too . if you want to tape & get worth 4 your dollar , get these !	1
Great bag . It does fit the A20 and an extra Compact Flash card perfectly . However , it is a bit tight when trying to fit 4 'AA ' batteries but it is acceptable . The quality of the bag is top notch and the fabric inside the bag wo n't scratch the lcd screen . The hidden cover is a bonus !	1
That 's right folks , this bag is in fact better than those made by Canon . I recently purchased a Canon A20 digicam as a backup for my Canon S100 Elph . Both are excellent cams . I bought the Canon PSC100 bag for the Elph , and though it fits like a glove , and retains the slick Elph form , it has no protection , little storage space , or extras . If you drop the bag , even on the carpet , you 're done for . And did I mentioned there 's no special cloth material to protect the LCD screen ? Now for the LowePro bag . This baby 's awesome ! It has enough compartments to store 8 extra AA batteries & amp ; 1 extra CF card , or 4 extra AA batteries & amp ; 3 extra CF cards . Plus , the material hugging the digicam 's very plush , creating a warm and protective feeling . And there 's also something special in the back . You can actually pull out a nylon hood to cover the bag on a rainy day . They thought of everything . Excellent work LowePro.Highly recommended for any digicam ... Just find one that fits your cam 's dimension .	1
I gave this 5 stars because the bag is so well made for its low price on Amazon . However it is not ideal for the Panasonic DMC FZ35 & I returned it . There 's too much unsuable extra space for this camera . You ca n't fit the camera with lens hood facing forward , the hood must be reversed , therefore you have 2+ '' of empty space above the LCD screen plus a way oversized exterior form factor . Lowepro recommends the Rezo 110 AW which fits the FZ35 much better & is smaller overall but with a lot more useable extra space . I bought the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 which Lowepro does n't recommend for the FZ35 . It fits the FZ35 perfectly ( with lens hood reversed ) like the old 35mm SLR ever-ready cases used to fit . The camera goes in & out easily & quickly with everthing attached & there 's room in a front pocket for a spare battery , lens cleaning cloth or bulb brush & the battery charger ( if you really want to stuff it ) . The TLZ 10 is hardly bigger than the camera & is unobtrusive . It is slghtly more expensive than then Topload Mini which points out what a bargain the Topload is for the right camera : a larger form bridge camera super zoom like Canon 's or other brand digital SLR with small zoom .	1
Lowepro makes great inexpensive camera bags and the Topload Zoom Mini is exceptionally well designed . Very sturdy construction and a decent amount of padding without making it bulky . The non-slip surface under the top of the shoulder strap does well at keeping it on your shoulder . I love that the top of the bag opens away from me for easy access to the camera and protects me from dropping it as I 'm trying to put it back in . The front compartment has plenty of room for extra batteries and even a couple of filters . This is the perfect bag for roaming around the Smoky Mountains taking photos on the trail.By the way , one other review stated that this bag was a perfect fit for their Fuji S9100 . No , no , no ! ! ! I have an S9100 and getting it in this bag requires that I wriggle , push , and STUFF it in . Way too tight . Made me very nervous that I would damage my camera trying to get it back out.HOWEVER , this bag was perfect for my Fuji S5100 , a considerably smaller zoom camera . Guess that 's why Lowepro calls this a `` mini zoom '' bag . The next bigger size of this bag is a fantastic fit for my S9100 with plenty of room but not too much . If you 're debating between the two bags compare the size of your camera to these two Fuji cameras and let that be your guide . Great bag , no fear ... ... ... .	1
I bought this bag along my Canon Rebel XT with kit lens ( 18-55mm ) , and it has a quite perfect size , with little extra room to fit strap . Internal pocket accomodates a couple of CF cards and external allowed an extra battery and charger.When I bought a 28-135mm IS lens , the bag turned a little tight to fit this big lens but putting strap along lens instead over back of camera , I would be able to walk around with it.Unfortunately I bought a Canon 40D , and with 28-135mm IS lens the bag do n't accomodate at all the new combination , so I 'm moving to a TLZ 1 bag instead.Bottom line : it 's a nice , reliable and resistant bag , with enough padding to protect camera and lens from small bumpings , light and inexpensive . A good choice for small SLR cameras with a small lens .	1
I got this for $ 20 from amazon along w/ the Nikon Lens brush for about $ 25 total and free shipping . The canon XSI w/ the kit 18-55mm IS lens fits snugly if you know how to position the camera . First , drop down the camera strap into the base of the bag ( see picture # 1 that I uploaded ) . Then put in the camera . Then Fold the strap over and rest it on top of the lcd screen . The strap will provide a second layer of cushinging for the lcd screen . The bag is the most compact one that you can get out there . The front pocket fits the charger , the nikon lens brush that I bought , and a few memory cards . Great value . Note , do n't expect to fit any other lens .	1
I bought this product for two reasons : first , I think it have a good design because it bag opens in form that you can hold the camera safety all the time and second , this bag fits like a glove with my camera Nikon D3000 with it 's 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens attached .	1
Very good camera bag , my canon xsi feets perfectly . Maybe it should have more pockets . But its very good for tourist traveling .	1
This is a great little bag . My Nikon fits lens down in it , and there is just enough room around the edges and top to squeeze my tamrac strap in as well . For the most part I do n't attach any straps to the bag and just carry it by the handle . Since it 's inexpensive , I also purchased the chest strap , which holds the bag snug against your chest but makes it very easy to retrieve the camera without removing the strap . Although I 've test-fitted the chest strap , I have n't taken it on a hike yet so I do n't know if I 'll like it or not.I held back a star , probably unfairly , because the fabric of the bag seems a bit thin and unexceptional . I do n't think this is a performance issue at all - I just would have preferred something thicker and more tactile , like ballistic nylon .	1
I 'm new to the dSLR game so hopefully this review is valid and helpful . I chose this bag because of all the other good reviews on it from people who were also looking for the perfect bag for their Nikon D50 . ( Thanks for all you reviews ! ) I just received this bag and it fits everything I need : D50 , the 18-55mm kit lens , spare battery , extra filter , and it even fits my other lens , a 50 1.8 ( in the external pocket ) . Perhaps if I become more advanced and would like to carry around more camera gear this would not be able to fit those any longer . But for the bare necessities that I own , it 's perfect.There is still a little bit more room to spare in the bag while the camera is in it . There is a zip pocket on the inside of the top flap for more accessories and an external pocket that seems to be able to fit quite a bit more.It feels sturdy and light , with just enough cushioning , for normal everyday use .	1
I have a D40 and this bag is perfect for it and few extra items ... worth the price ... the texture of the bag is soft and not that hard core material .	1
Make sure your lens is under 5.5 '' otherwise there might be a good chance that it wo n't fit.Other than that it is an excellent bag .	1
I purchased this bag based on the reviews and was concerned whether it could/would handle my Canon Rebel XT with a Tamron 28-300mm lens . The camera , with lens attached fit fine and the side compartments can hold my 18-55mm lens and camera accessories . The unit is compact and light . It serves the user well when taking a weekend trip or going on a hike as it frees up your hands while protecting the camera and lens .	1
OK , in an attempt to find the `` perfect '' backpack , I ordered this one ( LowePro Mini Trekker AW ) , the Tamrac Expedition 5 and the Kata R102 . I ran them through their paces and guess what I found ? None of them had everything I wanted . That being said , I settled on the Lowepro . Details below ... BACKPACKS IN GENERALThe Bottom Line : Simply put , it seems that it 's nearly impossible to find a backpack that combines comfort with capacity . The Kata R102 was , by far , the most comfortable , study backpack of the 3 but was hands-down the `` smallest '' pack space-wise . There was hardly any room for manuals ( my D70 manual and SB600 flash manual bulged the one pocket ) and very little storage for `` trinkets '' ( it all fell loose ) . The Lowepro and Tamrac packs had ample room , but were only semi-comfortable on my back compared to the Kata . So I had to decide between capacity and comfort . Since I really want a `` carry everything '' pack , the LowePro won out ( being cheaper when compared to Tamrac and having a better `` fit '' on my back ( 6'4 '' ) ) .THE LOWEPROThe Good : Of the three , only the LowePro was configured in a way that you could carry two `` ready '' cameras . Of course all 3 would carry a second body and lens , but not `` assembled '' . The LowePro has room at the bottom for a second camera pointing toward the top of the pack.The LowePro has the best `` non-camera '' storage system , with a system of mini slots and pouches for things like PDAs , iPods , books , etc . The Tamrac had this , but it was one big compartment where they would all jostle around . The Kata 's was non-existent ( literally ) .The LowePro and Kata both have a true weather-proof cover but the LowePro stores it away in a built-in pouch in the bottom instead of taking up a `` lens slot '' ( like the Kata , which is already space-limited ) .The LowePro is the cheapest of the three ( always a plus ) The Bad : Not much `` bad '' that I can see , aside from the fact that it 's not THE most comfortable of the three , but it certainly beats out the Tamrac which was the least comfortable of the three ( for me ) The Ugly : Of the 3 , the LowePro has , by far , the worst tripod carrying system . Sure , the `` hideaway '' tripod puch is nice , but the supplied system of *elastic rope* is flimsy and seems to have been included as an after-thought . The compression straps can be crossed and hooked to the `` wrong '' side as a fix , but one should n't need to `` fix '' anything at these prices ... I decided on the Lowepro ( as I said above ) because I wanted a `` carry everything '' bag that would fit on my back . What I get is a nice `` gadget bag '' that fits comfortably on my back for a run through the airport . I do NOT have a backpack , however , that would work for a several-hour hike . I have a pack that 's good for the State Fair so I have what I need and my wife can fit a few things she picks up as well . It will NOT be good for a day-trek through Paris . Then again , if I 'm hiking in the woods or sight-seeing through Paris , do I really want EVERYTHING camera-related on my back ? Probably not . I 'm more likely to carry a small sling/fanny-pack for the camera , a zoom lens and maybe a flash.When all was said and done , the LowePro struck the best balance of comfort and space . Space management was best in the one and comfort was second only to the Kata ( which I preferred most of the three but lost out because of severe space restrictions ) .Bottom line : You 're not gon na be satisfied with what you get ; ) At this price range , none of the backpacks serve up everything ( my Dad and brother , who are also amateur photogs agree ) . The LowePro WILL , however , serve your immediate needs and save you a few bucks to investigate other options . It 's sturdy and wears well for short periods of time ( maybe an hour or two tops ) and will DEFINTELY carry everything you might for a two-camera system ( assuming you can share secondary lenses between the two ) .Hope this helps ! PS I have no clue why this pack is showing up as `` unavailable '' on Amazon at the moment . Odd ...	1
Looking forward to using this on vacation . The tripod is very sturdy and is great for the price.I love how it compacts down to a foot - fits in a suitcase great . Supports my 5D2 with 24-70L quite well.To make it better : Allow alternative heads - a ballhead would be much better for photo work.Use better clamps . The leg clamps are the cheapest part on it - and I would have liked to see better plastic used . The legs are strong and metal - would have liked that level to been consistent throughout the rest of the design .	1
I looked around and after reading the reviews i picked this up and was not disappointed.The fluid head is very smooth for pans and tilts . A surprise feature was the quick release which locks open when the plate is removed so all you have to do is slide the plate back in and it snaps locked.The only concern i have is that is made up of a lot of plastic but hey for the price what do you expect .	1
I was skeptical about buying any type of fluid head tripod in this price range . I just could n't believe that it would be any good . I was pleasantly surprised by this tripod . It 's extremely easy to use and most importantly , its smooth . I was n't in the market to spend hundreds of $ on a Manfrotto or something similar , and honestly for the type of shooting I do this is perfect . If you 're looking for a tripod and were about to spend $ 25 - $ 30 on something you might find at Walmart , etc. , I can tell you that it is absolutely worth stepping up to something like this . You will definitely appreciate it once you use it .	1
For the price this tripod is tall , holds heavy cameras , moves smoothly , and is stable with over 5 pounds of camera and lens ( 6D + 70-200 2.8 II ) on it , even for windy night shots on a mountain top . It 's light enough to carry hiking , and it 's got indoor and outdoor feet built in . It 's got the bubble level and adjustable friction on the fluid pan/tilt mechanisms . It 's stiff enough to be used as a periscope with a 3lb camera attached ( grab all three legs together with two hands and hold camera up over a crowd ) .It survives a lot of banging around and the head is solid - but after dropping it from hand height onto the concrete one of the leg extension locks broke . They have some strange tiny pieces of plastic inside- seems unnecessarily complicated and flimsy . I replaced it with parts ordered on the phone from velbon . Two years later another one broke - I think the airline smashed my luggage that the tripod was in.So here 's the three issues that make it short of perfect : Leg extension locks should be redesigned without tiny flimsy plastic parts inside.It is n't as light and compact as some tripods are.It 's cheap but not free.So handle with reasonable care , buy a spare if you 're a pro , and enjoy .	1
Opened the box and was impressed . I have no experience with professional tripods , however , this tripod is built well if you are careful . People must really smash their equipment around to complain about this tripod being cheap . WEll built , However the fluid head has double adjustment . There are two screws that increase the pressure of the fluid making the tripod drift back during pans . These need to be loosened a bit if the tripod is drifting back too much . The other adjustments lock the tripod in place , Firm feeling and acceptable . Retractable spikes on the feet for outdoors . Built in level . Fantastic tripod if you are used to cheap-o Walmart tripods .	1
Much less hassle than cable ties . Can reuse many times have found different uses for . Thinking of buying more to have on hand .	1
I purchased these to clean up the maze of cables associated with my computer and auxiliary gear . They work very well . I find that these are superior to the & # 34 ; Ut Wire 5-Inch Flexi Ties Cable Wrap & # 34 ; ( which I also purchased on Amazon ) . I recommend these self-attaching ties .	1
There 's a large market for headphones in the $ 20 to $ 40 price range , and this set is among the best.The earcups rest comfortably against the side of your head without pressing into your ear at all . I find that I can wear these headphones for hours on end without getting sore ears , which would happen with several other similarly-priced headphones I have tried.The level of sound blocking done by these earcups is phenomenal . You can wear them without even plugging them in and enjoy a significant reduction in ambient noise . This also adds to the quality of sound you get when listening to music , particularly in noisier environments.My only complaint is the volume knob in the cord . The knob sticks out symmetrically from both sides of the plastic housing , so it 's impossible to tell which direction to rotate it to increase or decrease the volume without either trying and listening , or looking at the black-on-black markings , which are very hard to see.These work great with an iPod , I find that leaving the headphone volume knob turned up all the way ( which essentially means that it 's passing the signal through without dampening it ) and the iPod around half volume is a comfortable listening level .	1
I bought one of these cameras and find it to be all that the others have said . However , I find that in the bright sunlight you have trouble seeing the image in the LCD display . It would be of benefit to have a viewfinder , wish it did .	1
this case is great for my camera and my needs . i usually only take with me my digital camera , four extra batteries , and possibly one extra SD memory card . everything fits in there great , and i do n't have to worry about locating anything when i need it . i know just where it is . i bought this case for myself in december , and so far it has been to washington dc and new orleans ! i did take the suggestion someone else had made about strapping it around your waist , and it worked like a charm ... until the heightened security in the museums in washington , dc . i had to wiggle out of it so it could go through the x-ray machine ! but other than that , it was very comfortable , stayed put , and i had no complaints !	1
Love this product . It 's stylish and very compact . It fits 3 rolls of film in the front compartment . Got this for my Olympus Epic Stylus camera.You 'll love this product once you have one .	1
Excellent item that protects my digital camera well ; Has nice sized external pocket to carry extra batteries ( 4 AA ) and extra memory card . Very durable and still looks new after 2.5 years of use . Have taken it to India/Abu Dhabi & back as well as all over the US and still hold up well .	1
What ? StuffThe Canon Sure shot is the finest of all the film compacts . For two years , the Canon Sureshot was my mainstay . Simple in design and function , this camera provides dependable sure shots . The self-timer comes in handy .	1
I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter ( age 21 ) about 8 months ago . She is actually a knowledgeable photographer having taken photography courses in school , but wanted a simple point-and-shoot that she could use without having to think about f-stops and shutter speeds . As I am also a photography fan since my mis-spent youth , its common ground for us , and I get to see all of her pictures.I have to say that the camera has far exceeded both our expectations . It does a very respectable job under a variety of conditions and produces sharp , well-focused , consistent photos . It is simple to use and the zoom lens is terrific . We have not seen the flash problems that some of the other reviewers have reported . The only difficulty she has had with it is the pause between pressing the shutter button and the camera actually shooting , but that is overcome by using `` real-time '' mode whenever red-eye reduction is not an issue.But I think perhaps the best feature of this camera is its portability . It is so small and light ( and the lens retracts into the body and covers up when the power is turned off ) that she is able to keep it in her pocketbook at all times . Whenever life presents her with one of those `` Gee I wish I had a camera '' moments , she does ! If you 're looking for something inexpensive and durable enough so that you can keep it with you , and that you can use without too much thinking , this is a good bet . ***Update 10/02*** Just 3 weeks before the 1-year warranty would have expired , the camera developed a serious problem with it 's autofocus . We called the Canon 800 number and were referred to a local authorized repair center to whom we brought it . They called after a week and told us that they would have to send it to Canon and that there would be a $ 10 service charge . That was about a week ago.Even though the situation is not yet resolved , I thought it was important to post this update , since I 've seen exactly this same problem reported in several of the other reviews here . The camera was not heavily used nor was it abused in the year that my daughter owned it . I am reducing my rating to 4-stars because of this . I will update again when we get the camera back from Canon .	1
This summer while taking wide angle photos with this converter , I set my camera with fish-eye and small tripod on an unstable rock . As I set the timer , I watched in horror as my camera and converter fell off the rock and another 50 feet down a rocky slope . I thought all was lost , and my vacation ruined . To my amazement , the Nikon fish-eye converter and camera still worked ! The glass was pretty scratched up , but I was still able to take photos with it . Because it 's digital I was able to touch up the scratch marks on the photos when I got home . I 've since bought a new Nikon Fish-Eye replacement , but I continue to be amazed at its durability .	1
I considered and compared digital cameras that were pricier than the S70 . However , the S70 earned my money because of its image quality , ease of use , and USB connectivity.In the past , Sony built good cameras with innovative features ; however , the image quality has always been suspect in the minds of aspiring photo amateurs and professionals . With the DSC-S70 , Sony got it right ! One of the reasons that older Sony digital cameras had mediocre image quality was because of their mediocre lenses . Sony knew this ; so , they found someone who was really good at making lenses : Carl Zeiss . For me , the most impressive feature of this camera is the 21 mm Carl Zeiss , Vario-Sonnar lens . I 've used and admired Zeiss optics for many years in film photography . This lens yields excellent resolution , coupled with brilliant colors . Lesser lenses yield images with a focused center ; however , the edges and corners would not be as sharp . Not with this camera -- every pixel is clear and the details are impressive for even the most discerning eyes.Another reason that I got this camera is because of the wide variety of apertures and shutter speeds . The aperture ranges from f/2.0 to f/8.0 and the shutter speed can vary from 8 to 1/1000 seconds . Although the S70 does n't feature a full manual exposure mode , you get a reasonable degree of control.At the time I got this camera , Sony only offered Windows 95 & amp ; 98 drivers . I 'm delighted that Sony now offers support for Windows 2000 . Installation was a breeze . You can find the Win2K drivers here on Sony 's site ... The battery life is pretty good . On a full charge , you can take roughly 2 hours worth of use . The battery meter is pretty accurate , which indicates the number of minutes remaining . Although the memory stick technology is proprietary , it 's easy to use and very convenient . The 8 MB memory stick that comes with the camera is pathetic . You need more to take many high resolution pictures , preferably the 64 MB , which is the Sony 's largest to date . Rumor has it that Sony is making a 128 MB version of their popular memory stick -- way cool ! I would recommend getting an extra battery and a 64 MB memory stick -- using the 8MB memory stick as an emergency only backup.Good luck , and have fun with your new S70 !	1
OK , mine just showed up in the mail , so some thoughts:1 . Let 's start with the sound . It sounds great , but the earphones do suck , and the volume is too low . I knew the earphones would suck , though , so I replaced them with some Sennheiser 495s , which sound fabulous . On the volume thing , I think it may have to do with safety -- you 're not supposed to blast headphones , and this unit will not let you.2 . The thing does not skip.3 . It does not play all mp3s perfectly . Now , I get all my mp3s at 128 bps over Napster ( but not for long ! ) whether this has to do with the quality of mp3s I 'm getting or not , I do n't know . I create my discs with Easy CD Creator , which the unit seems to handle just fine.4 . The display is fine . s far as not displaying the name of the song , what CD player does this ? I think we 're getting a little spoiled here.5 . The display does not look cheap.6 . When these things actually get down to what they should cost - about 60 bucks -- this thing will rock . Until then , its an expensive toy .	1
Ok , here is the good stuff -- The Philips EXpanium has a tough , rugged case . It plays regular audio CDs as well as homemade CD-Rs and CD-RWs , which is a real PLUS ! The biggest plus is that it also plays CDs that have been recorded with MP3 files . It can play up to 999 MP3 files , if you can squeeze that many small ones onto a CD . More likely , you will have about 200 songs . Compare that to the 10 or 12 songs you get on a standard audio CD ! The sound quality is , as you would expect , great . It has anti-knock protection . It can play the songs in sequence , or shuffle them . It has all the standard features found on most portable CD players . And , it has a separate audio out jack in addition to the headphone jack.Now , for the bad stuff -- The silver control buttons look pretty sharp , but they 're hard to identify . The LCD display is tiny and not very bright . If you record more than one & quot ; album & quot ; ( that 's the name Philips uses to designate a separate file folder ) , the CD will play all the songs in all the folders ( shuffled or not ) . You can & quot ; program & quot ; it to play only certain songs , but that 's kind of tedious . It would also be nice if the display showed the file name or song title instead of just the sequence number of the file . And , although it does come with a car adapter , I found the volume is not high enough . You have to turn your car stereo volume up to the point where it begins to hum.Overall , it 's a good buy , and in my opinion , it represents the future of music players .	1
I bought this player when it first came out and it is an incredibly solid and reliable unit . The only major flaw is that it does not fast forward ( search ) or rewind ( reverse search ) through individual MP3 files ( it searches fine on CD Audio files ) . It also searches fine through folders/directories , both CD Audio and MP3 's . The LCD is n't that great but that 's not important to me . It does n't read id tags but I do n't care about that either.If id tags and FF/REW does n't matter to you , I 'd say buy this one . It will play ANYTHING you throw at it . ANYTHING ! 32-320 bitrate , 22,44,48Hz , CDR , CDRW , ISO9660 , Joliet . I was thrilled with the player , but I really need a FF/REW feature because I listen to many MP3 books . Some of the chapters are 30-45 mins long . If I have to stop in the middle of a chapter , I end up having to listen to the first half all over again ! ! bummer . So I bought a RioVolt to solve that problem.Anyway , my Expandium is still alive and well and used for MP3 songs , not books . I highly recommend this product except for that one MP3 seach flaw . I hope Philips gets the hint and will fix this in their next rev.-The case is well made and sturdy . -The hold button works fine . -The sound is good ( if you do n't use the included earbuds ) . -The separate Line Out works great . -I 've never heard it skip a beat . Ever ! and I 'm not exactly dainty with electronic gear . -The Resume feature resumes to the begining of the last track played . note : This is another less important flaw ( to me ) -- it does n't resume to the exact spot where you powered off , but at least it goes back to the folder and file you were last listening to . Many players do n't resume at all ! Supposedly , the RioVolt resumes to the exact spot with a firmware upgrade -- have n't tried it yet.Bottom line : Buy it if you do n't need to search thru individual MP3 's and if you do n't need id3 tags .	1
This player does what it 's advertized to do . It plays CD 's , and it plays MP3 's on both CD-R and CD-RW media . Sound quality is excellent even with MP3 's . Much better than the dismal sound quality of the similar , but less expensive , MpTrip player that I wish I had n't purchased and now sits on a shelf gathering dust . That said , here 's what could be improved : 1 ) Include a carrying case , or at least offer one . I searched the entire Amazon site and could n't find a case for the player . Only generic cases that were too bulky to be useful since they accommodated a number of CD jewel cases in addition to the player . If you use MP3 cd 's the one in the player and one on the side would do . One MP3 CD-R encoded at 128Kbs holds 150+ average length song titles . 2 ) Enlarge the display and show me the MP3 track title , not just an arbitrary number . The data is on the MP3 cd , let me see it ! 3 ) Ship the player with rechargeable NiMH batteries and allow them to charge while the player is plugged into AC power with the included AC adapter . I know you can buy NiMH batteries and chargers as a separate item from multiple sources , and I did . But it would be nice not to have to physically remove and replace the batteries everytime they are discharged . Battery compartment lids on these products are n't the most durable part of the device ...	1
This is the second trackball I have purchased like this , and I would highly recommend it to anyone .	1
The only movement is your thumb . A 1/2 inch flick and you are completely across the screen unlike a normal mouse where you have to pick up the mouse and retrace . I have 6 of these in case the company goes out of business , I 'll have mine . Get your own , you wo n't be sorry .	1
I ca n't say that this device will be everyone 's favorite , since I know people who can not manipulate a thumb ball , but this is `` hands down '' ( pun intended ) my FAVORITE . It 's comfortable , it 's effortless , and there 's zero stress on the wrist . I 've used one at work for years ( even back to the wired version ) . I just bought another one for home . Mine function flawlessly on both Windows XP and Vista ( 32 bit ) operation systems .	1
Since my desk exists in various states of [ dis ] organization , I grew weary of unearthing my cord to move the mouse , even a couple of inches . Frequently , the mouse cord slipped between book pages , or dragged a desk accessory to its demise to the floor . When I found this mouse , I could n't wait to get it.It replaces its identical Logitech corded cousin , so there was no learning curve , except for remembering that I had freedom to roam ! Installation to my PC was effortless and there were no issues . The receiver is quite large , as noted by one reviewer , but it is fine for a desktop like mine . Use with a laptop could be difficult for that reason.If you 're using a standard mouse-wired or otherwise-switching to a trackball will make your computer time much more comfortable . It will take a bit of time to get the hang of it , but the time spent adjusting is well worth it.Another plus to the Logitech is thumb control . I 've found that finger-operated control balls require more muscle movement and less accuracy . In my opinion , my hand rests comfortably on the beautifully ergonomic mouse and I can click n ' roll all day long . Due to a disability , I frequently use the onscreen keyboard . The design of the Trackman limits extraneous muscle movements , making it easy to peck away without pain.Great purchase ! UPDATE : March 7 , 2010 Three days ago , I dropped this thing on a hard floor . The impact caused the ball to land in the next room . IT STILL WORKS PERFECTLY ! !	1
I love this device . I bought the first one 5 years ago and am using it on my Desktop . I have grown so dependant on it , when I bought a laptop I decided to purchase a second one because it is so comfortable to use . It has been very reliable and I highly reccomend it to anyone .	1
Like all Logitech products it 's first class , works well and it 's well made . I wanted to get a ball mouse for my XP pro 64 operating system , the drivers are not 64 bit just yet but the generic drivers in XP pro 64 run it just fine . I also have a Logitech S510 wireless keyboard and I was hoping that the ball mouse could be sustituted for the cordless mouse that came with it . It can not , the S510 keyboard/mouse receiver will not accept the ball mouse signal , so I have two receivers in order to use the ball mouse . That 's not the best situation but still ok with me .	1
This is my fourth track ball purchase . The wife and I each have them on our PCs . The two I just bought are for the laptops . Think they are great .	1
Absolutely the best trackball made . Too bad Logitech no longer makes it . You can find them but the sellers ask ridiculous prices for them . I hope Logitech brings them back . I would buy a case of them .	1
I love sitting back with this thing in my lap , cruising the internet on the tv on my wall . No movement required . Just a good thumb and forefinger .	1
This is my first use of a trackball and I far prefer it to moving the whole mouse around . Very smooth action and precise . The wireless feature is perfect . Line of sight is not needed . Totally frees up the mouse with no cord . Just makes it a clearner operation . I got use to the trackball with my thumb in a day or two of use . Now I would n't trade for anything .	1
This is a great mouse for those of us who prefer the TrackMan style wheeled mouse . My last mouse was the Logitech corded Trackman and it was still working perfectly after 10+ years . I went cordless just because of issues with my pet cat .	1
when I first tried one of these it was really strange , now I really prefer this style over the standard typical mouse . You may too .	1
I have used a track ball for several years and the Logitech Cordless TrackMan is one of the best.The only down side is the receiver is a wired clam-shaped plastic box with a length of wire . When using it with my laptop , I long for a simple `` flash-drive '' like receiver to plug into a USB port in order to conserve space .	1
This is the wireless version of the legendary Logitech Track Wheel we love , but I should have paid more attention to the comments in the reviews about the limited range.If I have the receiver even 3 feet away the response suffers . I have placed the receiver right under my monitor about a foot away . I guess it is better than the wired trackman where I was always hassling with the cord getting in the way.When you have the pair close enough it works as well as a wired Trackman Wheel , and that is the pretty much perfect pointing device , deserving of its reputation and cult status.Setting it up was harder than you 'd think . You ca n't get the user manual - even from Logitech - but I guessed that once you put a AA battery in the trackball , you use a pin or pen to push the recessed button on the underside of the trackball and press the Connect button on the receiver . It took several tries for me to get it working on my Mac . It only worked when the receiver was plugged in directly to the USB port and not through a USB hub.Bottom line : The Logitech Cordless Trackman Wheel works as well as the wired Trackman Wheel , but you you 're only eliminating the first foot or so of cord.I 'd likely get another one of these in the future . I have the Bluetooth M570 and did n't like the response of that . *sigh*	1
This may be an old style mouse , but the Logitech Cordless TrackMan is still the best mouse for Online Gaming , especially FPS games . I have been using a TrackMan since Windows 3.11 days , and I have tried other types of Mouses , but always go back to my TrackMan . The Ball in the thumb position makes it quicker and easier to aim accurately . I can do a 180 degree `` about face '' with a slight movement of the thumb . Also the Logitech Cordless Trackman has GREAT durability . My last one I have been using nearly every night for almost 9 years , before the right bottom started to show signs slow reponsiveness from the extremely heavey use I put it thru . I definately got my money 's worth out of it , and was HAPPY to see that model is still being made . The fact that the Logitech Cordles TrackMan Wheel Mouse is still being made after all these years , tells me that they made this Mouse right in the first place .	1
Throw away your mouse , get a track ball . No cords , no pads and extremely good software . Everyone who comes over and uses one of my track balls wants one and this is the ultimate . I have had these units for over 11 years with no failures . They are as dependable as rocks .	1
I recently purchased two of the Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel trackballs . I needed/wanted one for my desktop Windows PC and one for my desktop Mac . I first hooked it up and installed it on the Windows PC and immediately loved it . Its ergonomic design makes it very comfortable ( only for right handers ) and the tracking is very responsive . I looked forward to installing it on my Mac.I researched customer reviews , Logitech 's Web site , PC World 's Web site and Mac World . I could not find any support or even troubleshooting ideas for getting this product to work with my Mac . I was disappointed because I really do like the trackball . Additionally , the packaging claims that it is Mac compatible but if that 's true , there 's no help or Mac related instructions . Even the CD ROM that comes with the trackball does not have any MAC executables on it . So , I sent it ( the second one ) back . After doing some more research I bought , for my Mac , the Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball ( model number 646325 ) . Guess what ? IT IS WAY BETTER than the Logitech . It is more expensive and it is NOT WIRELESS but in addition to being extrmely comfortable and responsive , it comes with a detachable wrist rest . I 've priced comparable wrists rests and a comparable one is $ 15 - $ 20.The Logitech is not suitable for laptops because a wired USB receiver needs to be plugged into your computer for the trackball to work . This would be very cumbersome in a laptop environment.So , while the Logitech is a very good product , it is not , in my humble opinion , the best or most comfortable trackball out there . That , and the Mac non compatibility issue are the only reasons I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 . While some may argue that the price difference makes the Logitech a better `` value '' I disagree . These are items that I use 10 to 15 hours six days a week and having a comfortable solution that will prevent stress and/or carpal tunnel ... well , an extra $ 15 or $ 20 for that is prevention I 'm HAPPY to pay.Buy this product for your Windows PC with confidence . If you buy the Logitech , for additional comfort , also buy the `` Fellowes Gel Flex Transparent Mini Wrist Rest ( Blue Crystal ) '' for $ 12.99 at Amazon.Or , if you do n't need a wireless solution buy the Kensington , which has a very comfortable padded wrist rest included.Happy Computing !	1
I 'm using it now to post this review . It stays on link and is accurate . Does n't require a mouse pad to operate , it 's reliable . Not for small hands , girls wo n't use it as much .	1
Though this mouse might not be everyone 's cup of tea , it suits me to a T. I do n't have to worry about wires . Nor do I have to bother moving the mouse around -- the thumb ball movements move the cursor . Because of this I do n't have to worry about the mouse pad -- the mouse works on any surface , even my knee . The shape is quite ergonomic . The only disadvantage is that the mouse is battery operated and the battery does have to be replaced occasionally .	1
This the 2nd Logictech cordlees trackball mouse I have had in the last 8 years . The 1st one lasted me 8 years until I purchased this one in July 2010 . The 1st one I had dropped alot of times over the years and it was very durable . The mouse is so comfortable and easy to use , you can lean back in a recliner and use the mouse easily there or anywhere . The only negative thing I can say about it is after a few years of use it kinda looses it precision some . It still works good but the thumb ball does not move as smooth as when it was new . Otherwise I can truly say it is a quality item .	1
Pros : Great features include 10x optical zoom ( incredible ! ) , viewfinder LCD , photo size adj , mic and MPG recordign ability for quick little videos.Cons : Bulky , battery power can go fast if using a lots of features.Overall , I 'd get this Mavica again . Good stuff from Sony !	1
I have had my telescope for several years and was never able to take a picture of what I was looking at . I finally am able to snap pictures .	1
I got this during my freshman year of college and am really glad that I did . It helped keep me organized and was cheap enough that it did n't break the bank . I could also play games before the professor/instructor came to class.Suggestions : I would definitely suggest getting a case for it , so you do n't have to worry about the cover flipping open . I would also suggest getting a keyboard for it because you can type your notes out and sync them with your computer when you get home . Get an extra stylus , too . I lost mine a few times ( always found it ) , but that what you will have one when you need it .	1
I just bought the Palm M100 a few days ago and let me tell you , it 's the best ! ! I 'm a college student and it is really useful . With my Palm , I write all my assignments , new addresses , put on quick notes ( like post-it 's , only that digital ) and a lot ... lot more . Before I bought this Palm , I checked the other ones , but I think this is the best organizer for a College or University Student , unless you are a professional or business man ( then get the other Palms ) . I think the price is worth it ! ! For the 2MB that offers , it 's the necessary for any beginner to the Palm World . I already download a lot a games , utilities and applications to my Palm and I even have more than the 85 % of Free Memory.I give it 5 stars since I love it ! I really recommend it . If you do not need a lot a memory , connect to the Internet or are looking for a good price on a Palm , then get the Palm M100 . You wo n't regret it !	1
Palms are great , and the m100 is no exception . Among this PDA 's biggest strength are its cost ( really cheap ) , its size and weight ( less than the V , I believe ) , and most importantly , its durability ( it 's extremely difficult to damage ) .Additionally , the visible clock and date are nice additions ( though they are n't a great replacement for on old-fashioned wrist-watch ) , and the removable faceplate is nice too.The ONLY problem with the m100 is the small memory size , but even the most intense PDA-users will have a hard time filling it.So , if you 're looking for a starter-PDA ( or a PDA for your child ) , the look no further than the m100 . Like all Palms , it 's easy to use , and all of the above . Great stuff .	1
I received the Palm M100 for Christmas of 2000 and it proved very useful until the fall of 2005 , when it suddenly began to have the same problem reported by other reviewers : it began draining batteries very quickly and could not hold information while changing batteries ( I would have to reload all my backed up data every time I changed batteries . ) I am usually on the road so this created a problem , unless I replaced my desktop with a laptop.To make a long story short , I trashed the old Palm and bought a used one to replace it for fifteen dollars , and when I replaced my PC with anApple iMac G5 Desktop with 17 '' M9843LL/A ( 1.8 GHz PowerPC G5 , 512 MB RAM , 160 GB Hard Drive , DVD/CD-RW Drive ) , the Palm made the transition well , after I added aKeyspan High Speed USB Serial Adapter ( USA-19HS ) .Would I buy another ? It depends on price : It has an inherent flaw , but I found a replacement quickly and for a good price . It serves my needs , I can concentrate on my work because do n't have to learn to use another device , and it works well . Moreover , my first Palm worked well for nearly five years , which is pretty good for an electronic device that got carted all over the country multiple times.Last , because the Palm is `` outdated '' , there are many accessories that can now be purchased for pennies on the dollar , such as thePalmOne m100 Series Slim Leather Carrying Case , and colorul faceplates like thePalmOne m100 series Faceplate Cover ( Pacific Blue ) .	1
This smaller , lighter and sleeker unit does everything my Palm III can do , except email ( I never used it ) , for at least $ 100 less . The unit runs all the great ( and generally free ) Palm programs and the diminished memory is unlikely to pose a problem for 99 % of users . Processor speed seems better , and legibility is improved . My only regret : the cable which replaces the cradle is serial port only ; a USB cable would have been lots easier .	1
Although the eTrexes were really designed for use in the outdoors , I use it in the car to help predict distance to go , etc. , and if I have the local map downloaded to it , it has helped me out of binds on a couple of occasions . If you use it in the car , you really want this adaptor to save your batteries.Not only will it save the batteries , but I can operate my Legend in normal mode to get better position from the WAAS data . ( Battery saver mode precludes the use of WAAS and normal mode can really drain the batteries rather quickly . ) ( BTW , there is no scientific reason for reception to be better because of using this adapter . ) The cord is generously long . In fact , it can get in the way sometimes , but may allow the unit to be passed to the back seat so your back seat navigator can monitor it.I have only two minor complaints . The first is the price . The Garmin Legend gives a lot of feature for the price , but Garmin seems to make up for it with the price of the accessories . It seems this adaptor should cost half what it does.The second is that the fuse is accessed by screwing off the center of the cigarette plug , and the center piece has unscrewed itself on a couple of occasions now , leaving several small parts strewn about . I had to dig in my glove compartment this weekend for all of the little parts , and am waiting for the day I lose one for good . So be careful that the center is always screwed in.I use this with the suction cup mount , which works quite well on glass . ( But again , seems kind of expensive for what it is . )	1
Garmin Bicycle mount works well . Easy to attach to GPS . Easy to put on/remove from Bicycle mount .	1
I wish I would have found this 5 years ago . This is a great addition to my GPS for trail riding .	1
I just bought a new Specialized road bike with standard handle bars , and this mount did not fit . I know I should have read the tech details ( fits handlebars up to 1 inch ) and then measured my bike , but I figured it would fit a standard bike.Any advice ?	1
I 've owned a Garmin e-trex Legend for years , but recently wanted to mount it to my bicycle . This mount was quickly and easily fixed to the handle bar . The quick-release of the GPS is handy , allowing me to remove and re-attach the GPS . This was certainly worth the purchase ! UPDATE : After a few weeks of using this I 've noticed a small problem - though I am not certain if it is the mount or not.If I travel over very bouncy surfaces , or drop over curbs with this on my bike , the GPS will occasionally shut off . I suspect that the batteries are somehow disengaging , though I am not certain . I do not know if this problem is related to the mount , or something else , but I thought I 'd add it to my comments ...	1
The mount consists of two pieces . One piece fastens onto your handlebars . It attaches very firmly and will prevent the unit from moving even over the roughest terrain . The other piece replaces the standard battery compartment cover on the GPS . When you want to mount the GPS to your bike you just snap the two components together.I was impressed by the quality of the pieces and suspect that it will be very durable . I only have two negative comments regarding this design . First , the handlebar mounting piece is tightened on via a screw . I have a road and a mountain bike and will want to switch the unit between the two . I would have preferred some sort of quick release mechanism that does not require the use of tools . Secondly , I wish that the battery cover did not have to be replaced with the new one . The one that comes with the bike mount is not rubberized and it has a clip on it that could catch on things . That means that you 'll want to put the original cover back on the GPS if you want to use it as a hand-held . Having to use two different covers means that there is just one more piece that you 'll need to remember to bring on your trips - and one more thing to possibly lose somewhere.Despite these gripes , I am very impressed with the mount and can recommend it .	1
This mount fits easily on my mountain bike and hold the GPS safely without fear of it falling off .	1
nice case well made great for using while hilking or walking . clear plastic over view window , and a velcro closure .	1
Nice , high quality , and fits the etrex like a glove !	1
I use this case for my Garmin Etrex 30 , it ' fits in the case okay , but it is n't exactly tight . It defiantly wo n't fall out but it would be nice to see Garmin improve the fitment for this product . All in all a great buy , gives my GPS more protection and allows me to clip it onto my bag .	1
Just an everyday case , nothing to fancy , but it does fit well . Exactly as described . Great fast shipping . There are however better ways than this to carry your handheld .	1
This case is exactly what it appears to be . I did not notice any loss of signal while using it . There is a bit more glare on the screen in direct light but any time you put plastic in front of plastic that is going to happen unless it is treated with anti-glare coating . Works great and worth the small price tag .	1
got this and then put my 30 in it . fit like a glove and the opening are perfect fit for the buttons and screen . fit on the belt great , just like carrying your phone . does real well protecting the e series from normal wear . have a etrex , get the carrying case for protection	1
OK , I give this case 5 stars even though I do n't use it and probably never will.It fits perfectly on my eTrex Venture and is of good quality . That being said , it just gets in the way . The unit is rugged enough by itself and does n't really need a cover . It 's just another doo-dad I thought I had to have.If I could to do over again , I would n't buy it .	1
Custom cover to fit the eTrex model Garmin GPS units . Fits snug and offers good screen and bump protection . Does the job and looks decent as well .	1
It fits the Garmin eTrex very well , leaving it usable and may save it from damage in case I drop it .	1
Nice protection for my Garmin . I wanted something to clip on my belt with a lanyard loop and this has both . Protects the screen well . Everything I wanted .	1
The case fits the Garmin eTrex Vista HCx like a glove . It has a nice feel to it and the buttons , of the GPS , can be operated with absolutely no problem . Highly recommended for those who want to protect their , Garmin eTrex Vista HCx GPS due to rough use .	1
Well , i bought this free a few weeks ago with rebate . What else can you say about a free optical mouse ? But just ignore the rebate , I own this optical mouse and another one : Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical . They are comparable in price , but this logitech one is clearly the better choice . More responsive , comfortable , accurate , better feel , better look , ... ... . Logitech products have n't disappointed me so far . I guess no matter what Bill does , Microsoft ca n't stiffle competition here . Microsoft is just not that great on hard ware.I gave only 4 stars because this mouse is not perfect , of course . More $ can buy you a better mouse . But this is a great value for the money ( even without rebate ) .	1
I was damn bored with all those cleaning stuffs in sticky ball based mice . And then suddenly saw Amazon selling it.Bought it and must say , that 's a good deal . Logitech mouse is the best ... go for it .	1
I now own two of these style mice from Logitech . My original mouse on my computer and now the mouse I just bought for my wife 's computer . I use a Mac G3 and my wife has a Window ME machine . Both mice are great . I will never go back to a ball mouse again .	1
I 've had trackball 'd mice for years , and this is my first optical mouse . so this review is for people like me who wanted to switch to opticals . if you are looking , this is a very good choice . I 've had mine for 8 months with no major problems . and I am someone who will return almost anything if I saw a slight scratch or blemish . so I am hard to please.I use this mouse for normal everyday use . I have one at home and sometimes unplug it and take it to work . so on average I have used this thing for about 4-6 hours per day . everyday for the last 8 months without any accuracy loss . Still precise as the day I bought the mouse . there is one screw so nothing really to come apart , or fall apart.And I used this thing for gaming which means ALOT of mouseclicks and after 8 months noticed the left button was not as sensitive , wehn clicking . the only thing I found was there are plastic components that hit each other inside ( I opened mine up ) and long story short there was a little dent where the left button was serverly used . : - ) ( of course this is my own doing ) . couple of drops of Krazy glue to fill the & quot ; dent & quot ; on the plastic piece and left button is as good as new . : - ) besides this little problem ( which I caused ) the mouse if awesome . ( barely any dust inside the mouse after 8 months of use BTW ) I have not tried other opticals , I also have read reviews on cordless and they seem fine , but for gaming cordless opticals are not sensitive to fast movements . if you are sick of cleaning mouse balls..and believe me I was . : - ) get this mouse . I 'm amazed how accurate this thing still is . oh , I have tried the mouse on white , black , wooden , glass ( clear and refelctive ) surfaces . shiny and matte . this mouse worked on ALL of these surfaces . cheers .	1
What can you say about a mouse ? For the money , Logitech makes some of the nicest mice out there . Very pleased .	1
I have bought an insane number of pointing devices . I 'm not sure why that is , exactly , but I 'm sure that therapy will probably be needed to unravel the mystery . The practical upshot , however , is that I 've owned and/or tested just about everything that 's come on the market in the past few years -- and this little device is right at the top of the list.I find it to be far superior to its Microsoft competitor , which seems to be less fluid in its movements . Often , I 've had to pick up the Microsoft Optical mouse from the desktop surface in order to `` reset '' it . Plus , when doing detailed graphical work , the Microsoft 's tendency to randomly jump a few pixels is really annoying . Maybe my particular Microsoft mouse is a slight lemon , and in fact there 's nothing generally wrong with the device , but for whatever reasons , I 've had much fewer problems with this Logitech version . It 's easily the most fluid , responsive pointing device I 've ever used -- outside of a graphics tablet.I am baffled , somewhat , by other reviews which comment on it 's less-than ergonomic design , or its appropriateness for small hands only . After all , an `` ergonomic '' mouse almost certainly means a mouse that is designed for right-handed users . This more egalitarian design can be used by hands of all persuasions.Nor do I notice any unusually `` cheap '' clicking sound when I press the mouse buttons . It is certainly slightly louder than other mice I 've owned , but it 's hardly a sound connoting bad construction.About the only problem I 've encountered with the device , in fact , has to do with the controlling software . If you 're buying this as a replacement for a Logitech device already installed on your machine , you do have to take care to uninstall all that old software before proceeding . I found that one game I play got really confused when I just installed the new Logitech MouseWare over the top of what was already there . All the problems cleared up , however , when I manually uninstalled all Logitech MouseWare and then did a fresh install.Having said all this , and recognizing that the cord provided is a fair bit longer than most mice provide , I am intrigued by the future availability of a cordless version . I have a cordless Logitech roller ball mouse , and like the freedom it offers . If Logitech manages to pull off the same fluidity with the cordless version that they have with this one , it will be very hard to continue to prefer this one.In the here and now , however , I really doubt you 'll find a better , more precise mousing experience than the Logitech Wheel Mouse Optical .	1
I do n't know what some of you are talking about , but this is an AMAZING recorder for it 's price . This is the read deal . I have used many recorders and this one , surprisingly , works best with the application that I use it for . It has a very high quality audio playback . Do n't be fooled by its price .	1
Just got this radio for my jeep for those off road trips and no complaints yet . Its been rained on and jarred around something fierce and it keeps on ticking . Had a cobra cb and it just could n't handle the abuse . So for the price and durability this is definitely the way to go if you need a CB .	1
I bought the Uniden to replace a practically brand new Cobra 19 that has never worked correctly . I first tried buying another new Cobra 19 , but I got it home and it had a bad mike . I do n't know what has happened to Cobra ; that used to be all I would buy . They are junk now.Anyway , the little Uniden works very well for a small low end radion . I needed a small radio to go into my Jeep because there is n't a lot of room and plus I did n't want to tie up a bunch of money in it if someone stole it.I 'm very satisfied with the Uniden radio and would recommend it .	1
Installed this in a Toyota Tacoma with a Firestick Firefly antenna . Easy to get the SWR set and have had nothing but compliments on this radios audio . Running it barefoot with the stock mic even !	1
I 'm really not much of a CB'r , never have been , but this seems to be a good little radio . Sensitivity is pretty good and the filtering ANL seems to keep out stray noise . The built in speaker is a little weak , but this is a pretty small unit .	1
This is worth every penny . I use it out on the trails when I 'm offroading and it has everything I need . It also has a external speaker output so you can hookup a speaker and when you get out of the vehicle you can flip it to PA and hear the CB through that speaker . I highly recommend this CB !	1
I found that CB is not as useful as it was 35 years ago for travel . On a recent cross country trip it helped me find out what was causing 2 major traffic delays , but in both cases it did not give me a timely warning to avoid them . Still , it 's nice to have as a back up .	1
I received this unit less than a month ago and gave it 5 Stars . Then it failed on me and I had to send it back . Amazon replaced it with their usual 'superior customer service . '-Many of the comments appear to be from 'professional reviewers ' so I read them with a grain of salt . No matter what people say you 're not going to get over 10 miles on 4 Watts of power . Here are my Pros and Cons.-Pros - It 's a small unit with many useful features . ANL , Gain , volume and squelch controls on the front and a PA outlet on the rear . When I first hooked it up I had an almost perfect impedance with my SWR meter . It gave out 4 Watts and had crystal clear audio . I ca n't impress enough that a 'good ' antenna is imperative.-Cons - The stock mic is cheaply made with passable modulation . The mic cord is very short , but I can live with that . Since linear amps are a 'No-No ' get a decent power mic if you want to be heard .	1
Very compact . Easy to use and mount.Works as well as much larger unit , but much more compact.Will recommend to others .	1
I use this on rallys , it 's small and discreet easy to remove and install back again . Does n't have amazing range but good enough for me . I use in combination with the little wil antenna . Waaaaayyyy better than any of those handheld radios and fantastic for checking the route ahead if you can get in touch with a friendly trucker or two .	1
I 've been running the Uniden PRO538W for about a year now , and I 've been quite pleased with its performance . I mainly use this when headed out to the country with my buddies . Being able to stay in contact with your convoy while on the road is great , and this radio excels at this task . Once you get out of town and away from most interference , the range you can achieve is quite good ; easily a few miles , and a good deal more if conditions are right.The front mounted speaker is a nice touch , depending on your application . The Uniden PRO538W is nice and loud , and has a clear tone to it that is not overly `` tinny '' sounding like some small speakers . Physically , this CB is somewhat large - at least as compared to some of the `` mini '' CB 's you see on the market these days . I do n't find it to be problematic , but be aware of the size if you have a limited space for installation.If I had any suggestions for improvements , they 'd be back-lit knobs for the volume , squelch , RF gain , and channel knobs . While each of these knobs has a decent tactile feel , they 're pretty hard to see at night . This is especially frustrating when trying to make small adjustments in squelch or RF gain.Overall , the Uniden PRO538W seems to be well built , and I see no reason it wo n't last for years to come . I 'd recommend it to anyone looking for a CB radio .	1
Years ago , nearly everyone had a CB radio in their vehicle and possibly one as a base station at home . Technology has since placed a decline on CB 's . Or has it ? I bought this radio just as soon as I got home from a vacation in Alabama , this spring when the massive tornado swept the state . Putting it bluntly , if you did not have a CB , you could not communicate with anyone . Cell phones were often without service and land lines were wiped out . WI-Fi was non-existent . We were on our own.I was stunned to survive the tornado , only to witness travelers stranded at service stations even as far north as Birmingham . There were no Walt-Mart stores open , no grocery stores , no gasoline stations or truck stops open . And , no way on earth to find out if there were someplace further along the road that may be open . Travelers from other states low on fuel , simply wandered around gas pumps at every truck stop in a daze . We were four hours from any restaurant , restroom or gas station . We made it to Tennessee only by the kindness of Truck drivers who had CB radios and could tell us what places were open in Tennessee . Almost all of Alabama was shut down.It is a lesson well learned . Despite emergency preparedness and technology , everything can go fizz when mother nature strikes . And power may not be restored for days or even weeks . Survivalist or just plain concern for your family , I recommend you buy this Uniden radio . A great value for a life-saving device to have on hand everyday or in an emergency . Lots of range to connect you with Truck Drivers and emergency officials , crisp clear communication and easy for any family member to operate , and easy for you to install .	1
Try using USB Overdrive instead of the supplied software.Once you use a wheel , you ca n't go back .	1
I bought the Mouseman optical after reading lots of reviews . I am very pleased with it . I have tested it in unreal tournament and it works very well except for a few scroll wheel issues which can be fixed with a patch . I am one of the flick gamers and I found no problems with the mouse other then the scroll wheel . The only time the optical camera failed me was when I move it as fast as I can to test it , but you must move it faster then you will ever need to . To achieve the speed to fool the camera you must move so fast you can not use the mouse for any operation . The mouse shape is very comfortable and fits my hand very well , better then the explorer . Although I like the scroll wheel of the microsoft mice because they feel better I would still go with this mouse because it is better and easier to grip.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the scroll wheel . When scrolling in internet explorer I found there was a slight lag between I turned the wheel and when the page started scrolling and that the scroll was choppier then the MS mice	1
I 've had this camera for about 3 years now.Picture quality : - takes great pictures outdoors , and indoor pictures with adequate lighting.- flash is not adequate . pictures with flash are horrible . they come out all blurry - the shutter speed is n't fast enough/CCD not good enough ( when using auto settings ) Use : - I like having the ability to change the f-stop setting on the fly with the knob on top of the camera . Sure beats using the menus.- The battery lasts a long time , but it 's always good to have a spare , especially if you use LCD alot.Construction : - Solid.- I 've fallen on this thing while skiing ( back of case is cracked ) and took it with me when I accidentally fell into Lake Tahoe ( camera was submerged ) , but amazingly it still works.Summary : I 've taken thousands of pictures with the camera . Certainly got good use out of it over the past 3 years.However , newer cameras have better flash capability and record in video . My friends have the Canon SXXX series . They are 1/2 the size of the Kodak , and perform much better .	1
After shopping around , I found the Kodak DC 4800 to be the best price versus performance deal on a mid level digital camera . The hi quality picture ( 3.1 MP ) , USB transfer , manual vs automatic settings and powerful lithium ion battery are usually found on much more expensive cameras.Obviously for any camera buff image quality is paramount . The DC 4800 's high resolution pictures will blow up to 8x10 easily , and even up to 11x14 with a good quality shot . There are a large number of controls that allow the user to adjust for a particular look ( saturated color , neutral color , b & amp ; w , filtered ) or for unique lighting . We found that the image quality on this camera was excellent compared to the other digital cameras that we tried out . Some of our shots showed some aliasing ( jagged lines ) in compressed modes . However , it disappeared once the images were shot in uncompressed mode ( and without digital zoom ) . As noted by other reviewers , getting the firmware upgrade from the kodak website is important for the quality of low light shots.Another important feature is ease of use . The camera software is easy to install , the manual is well written and the placement of most common shot settings on a dial on top of the camera is very helpful . I wanted simple point and shoot , which this camera easily supports . On the other hand , my girlfriend is a commercial artist and wanted to be able to operate with manual settings on a traditional camera . Both of us are very happy using the camera.The only negatives are lack of twain compliance , the small memory card and the long battery charging time : - TWAIN is an industry standard interface that will allow you to connect your camera directly to numerous photo imaging software packages . This is not supported by the DC 4800 so most file transfers are a two step process . - A 16 MB compact card will only hold 10-15 images with standard compression . ... The battery charger takes four hours . A faster charger is available with a second battery but again it costs a little muchOverall , this was a great deal ( note it pays to shop around as the price on the camera varies greatly ) for a camera that will grow with your experience . From day one , you will get great quality shots and as you become more confident , you can manually adjust many functions to produce your own look .	1
I used these strips to hid wires running up next to my fireplace and to hide them on the ceiling in my theater room . The adhesive used on the backing is very strong . Make sure you have it lined up before you let it touch anything or it will stick ! I have it on drywall and on my baseboard trim . Hasnt fallen off yet . Its nice that it comes with all the joint covers too . It makes it easy to turn a corner and keep things hidden .	1
It is a great item for hiding unsightly wires , but not more than 3 wires in one lines or it wo n't close . Use a roller brush to paint them and wish that there were more end units .	1
This product works great for our needs . I bought this to use for the surround sound home theater system I bought for my husband . I was able to put them up myself . They are very easy to cut . I was able to use a standard sharp kitchen knift . The edges were a little jagged , so I recommend using something made for cutting materials if you want a cleaner cut . I ordered one set to make sure it suited our needs , and since it was just what we needed , I went ahead and ordered a second set to cover the rest of the cords . I have n't painted them yet . I wanted to paint before putting them up , but they sat around for a month so we finally put them up as-is ( white ) . So I ca n't speak to how they look after they 're painted to match the walls . I did not user any of the angled connector pieces , so I ca n't rate that either .	1
Simple and cheap . Works well . Was able to cut it to length as needed with a hacksaw . Comes as described .	1
I needed to hide a wall cord from an overhead fan that was not hard-wired . This track worked perfectly ; beyond my expectations ! The quality i great , adhesive sticks very well ( make sure to PREP the surface you are going to adhere to prior to installation ) and is not an eye-sore ! I used one of the 4-foot tracks and a 90 degree elbow to cover from the outlet plug , up the wall and to the roof beam to hide the cord . Could not have worked out better . I still have 3 , 4-foot sections left and multiple end connectors for other & # 34 ; cord projects & # 34 ; . My estimation is that 4 sets of speaker cable could fit in the 4-foot run , 2-3 small power cords or 2 HDMI cables . The tracks have a smaller profile so I do n't think 4 heavy-duty power cable could fit inside the track so plan accordingly . Items appear to be able to be painted over ( people have posted pictures of their setups that are painted ) and I do n't any reason why they could n't be painted ( again , prep the surface properly ! ) . Overall great product and something I should have done a LONG time ago ... visually are cables bothering you ? Buy this product !	1
This product works great to organize and hide the cords coming from your tv . I would definitely recommend painting them the color of your wall so that it blends in and is n't noticeable . If you the actual electrical plug running from your television is too short to reach your outlet , you will have to figure out another solution because the casing is too small to house the plug or extension cord ending . After installation , I had plenty of casing left to use on another project .	1
I was in need of cable runs to hide speaker wire along a ceiling beam . A few of these kits happily allowed me to do multiple complex angles and flush speaker wires against the ceiling and down to multiple speakers.1-star deducted because some of the adhesive material failed after around 12 months , however I only had to replace one section and the rest has so far held up just fine . While no replacement for screw-in rails , these plastic runs work just fine for most home applications .	1
I needed to hide some CAT 6 cables in a conference room , including going down from a ceiling , and around a corner . it was very easy to mount , and the assortment of corner mount devices made the job look professional .	1
Generally , the product is good and works as advertised . Definitely more positive than negative , however ... it is very hard to snap shut the tray once you 've put the cables inside . I had to really work to get the tray closed in a tight place . Also , I wish they would be more specific about which other products match this one if you do n't want to buy the full kit . I need one more 48 '' length of tray , but am not sure which product to buy for the matching component.One more positive point - I used the adhesive backing to stick to distressed wood and brick . It seems to hold well on both of those surfaces , which I was pleasantly surprised by .	1
Bought to hide speaker wiring around the room . Stays fastened once closed . Adheres to plaster very well - make sure you do n't have to take it off once you stick it on . I inserted 3 large gauge cables and had a little trouble fastening the cordmate . Much cheaper than retail stores , including Home Depot . Looks good .	1
It works pretty much as described , but the problem is that if you ever have to remove the pieces from the wall , and move them , then you 're in trouble , and if your power cord is a little bit short , you have another problem . The adhesive on these is good , but if you stick it on the wall , and then have to move it , maybe 2 inches over , the adhesive may or may not stick . And if your power cord inside the plastic pieces is short , and you have to put it at a slight angle to the outlet , the pressure it puts on the plastic runners will pull it off of the wall . The thing I liked the best about it , was that the color matched my wall , so you have to look hard to see it . And as long as you do n't have to remove any piece from the wall , and stick it somewhere else , it works great .	1
It was n't exactly what I was looking for at first , but after installing it at home , I think it 's a great value for the price ( especially since locally a simple 5 ' section costs $ 15 ... so a kit with 3 4 ' sections for $ 24 is steal ! ) Right now I have two speaker wires , one coax , and one Cat5 cable running through the most crowded sections , and there 's still room for more ! Only issue I might have later is that it 's adhesive- and realized later that my walls are all wallpaper ... hehe . It will be fun if I have to rip it off ! Wish I could just have nailed/screwed it in ... But definitely a good buy !	1
As noted by others , these cable covers are easy to cut , mount and use . They are very easy to open ( used a flat head screwdriver ) and easy to put your cable and power cord into . If not stuffed with more than two cords , they are easy to close too.Also as noted , the adhesive is strong ... so have your channel in the right place before removing the protective film or else you risk it getting stuck in some undesirable position and making a mess if you try to move it . The film was easy to pull off with the channel sitting right in the place we wanted to install it , so it should not be an issue if you do good prep work.The channels really look great in place ! My only wishes would be : ( 1 ) Wish the channels were roomier as they max it one power cord and one cable or they wo n't close properly ; ( 2 ) Wish that the T-junctions and corner elbow covers could be made a bit oversized ... I had to use a cable-splitter at a T junction , and had to run an small two-prong extension cord to an elbow , and both remain uncovered as the respective covers are just too small.All considered , good product that I would recommend .	1
Ordered this based on Amazon reviews . It worked great . Super- easy to install , Painted up perfectly . Could n't be more simple and the price was great .	1
I managed to squeeze 3 wires in it , coaxial and 2 electric extension cords ( one of them was heavy duty A/C wire ) .Looks nice and neat.I just hope it is not going to come off the wall .	1
This item worked perfect . It could be a little bigger to put more cables in but it worked for what I needed it for . Some reviews say that it cost to much or they dont give you enough length . I find it very resonable . Yes I did buy a second kit because I needed more . But it was for a different project . I will buy even more if I need it . The price is perfect . Always remember . You get what you pay for . I know they have a newer kit available but I think this one is worth the money so Im sticking with this one .	1
Having used some other low-end digital cameras in the past , I must say that this one is a welcome relief . Most of these other cameras have what I feel is a critical flaw - a long wait between pushing the button and when the camera actually takes a picture . Some of the other cameras can take as long as three seconds between & quot ; clicking & quot ; , and when the photo is actually taken . While this does n't sound like a big issue , I can guarantee that you 'll end up with a lot of pictures of floors and ceilings with the other models - especially when someone unfamiliar with the camera pushes the button and then looks at the camera to see why nothing happened . Of course , you can erase these errors without any cost involved as the camera 's digital , but there 's no guarantee you can replicate the moment you were trying to capture . Thankfully , this camera eliminates this concern . The resolution of this camera is certainly adequate for web and email pictures , and would be ideal for anyone who needs to take digital pictures for online auctions like ebay . Plus , it comes at a very affordable price for people who would like to experiment with digital photography .	1
I 've been shooting the Finepix 1400 for a year , so I was interested in this camera when it came out . I recently had the opportunity to play with one for a while and I was impressed with what I saw . It 's a well thought out design , still a good value , and an excellent example of technological evolution.More than just a higher-resolution version of the 1400 , the Finepix 2400 is an evolutionary successor that builds on the features of the 1400 . The ergonomics that made the 1400 easy to use are still there , but the resolution is doubled , and there 's a lot more manual control available- something I find myself missing in the 1400 . While the automatic mode produces fine exposures , photographers used to the flexibility of a manual camera will find much to like here . There 's more exposure control , a new color balance control , and a sequence shooting capability that should please sports fans . All this for a price not much higher than that of the 1400 a year ago.There are a few downsides . Shooters with a dominant left eye will find the optical viewfinder hard to use as their noses will tend to get in the way . The supplied 8MB Smart Card is far too small ; you 'll need a 32MB or preferably a 64MB card to take advantage of the camera 's capability . Luckily the price of memory has plummeted over the past year , so that 's no real drawback.In short , this is a reasonably priced camera with good resolution and good optics that 's suitible for the novice or the experienced photographer . I expect it 'll be as big a hit with buyers as the Finepix 1400 was .	1
Sure , aftermarket angle finders are available , but one can not beat Canon quality . Good optics and construction . In this case one gets what they pay for .	1
Fits perfectly , if not better than the original eye cup that came on my Canon 60D . The rubber seems to be a little bit more rigid , but nothing to worry about .	1
As a replacement eye cup ... ..perfect . But , do not expect it to have a diopter or any form of lens , it does n't . Being used on a Canon 60D , I also purchased a 'special ' diopter to supplement the original equipment diopter . In reality , I did n't need to , but now , I have a spare . In other words , you can add a 'special ' diopter lens without the need to purchase this .	1
Works as it should , fits well , with the same quality as the original OEM version , fits all EOS versions that I have .	1
This is an unchanged 10 year old antique . The ST-E2 ONLY controls groups A and B slaves . So , another wireless method for the group C slave ( s ) to fire would be to have them attached to slave hot shoe ( s ) and hope that no one else uses flash near the slave ( s ) . A better solution is to set another group A or B Speedlite on manual and dial in the required output.Flash exposure compensation ( FEC ) can be set on a hot shoe mounted 580 series Speedlite used as a slave trigger to control FEC to compatible Speedlite slave groups . The ST-E2 CAN NOT perform this task . Instead , you can walk over to each slave and set the FEC to achieve the same effect.Direct line of sight indoors is USUALLY not required . The building 's interior hard surfaces help in bouncing the wireless signal to the slave ( s ) .The ST-ET comes with a black coloured pouch having the same rugged material as the 580 series pouches.To conclude , one star was removed for the : [ 1 ] odd size battery which is not carried in all stores [ 2 ] inability to control group C slave ( s ) [ 3 ] lack of control over FEC ( not a problem because the unit has rear buttons to adust the flash ratio in 1/2 stop increments for groups A and B slaves ) , manual flash ( each slave must be individually set ) and stroboscopic flash ( each slave must be individually set ) The Canon ST-E2 Speedlite Transmitter is not as sophisticated as the Nikon SU-800 Wireless Speedlight Commander . The ST-E2 which does n't come cheap is half the price and size of the more versatile 580 series Speedlite used as slave triggers .	1
I was somewhat hesitant about ordering this but after using it for a few weeks I like it . I would rather have something that fits into the camera body instead of mounting on the camera shoe . I have not had any problems with it so far . I also think like other Canon products , the price is a little steep .	1
good for the purpose intended and is very well built .	1
This bag fits my Canon 50d with 17-85mm lens attached . My Canon G15 in case , Canon 100 Elph camera , 70-300 canon lens , 100 mm macro and all the filters , 6 batteries , 3 charger , and other attachments . Plenty of room . Highly recommended . Very well made bag .	1
Quality A++++ Durability A++++ Value A++++ Storage Space A++++ I 'm able to fit in ( 1 ) Canon 5D Mark II camera , ( 1 ) Canon ef 50mm f/1.8 lens , ( 1 ) Canon ef 24-105mm f/4L lens w/hood , ( 1 ) Canon ef 85mm f/1.8 lens w/hood , ( 1 ) Canon ef 70-200mm f/4L lens w/hood , ( 1 ) Canon 580 EX Speedlite Flash , ( 1 ) 430 EX Speedlite Flash . The hoods are inverted to fit them in . The bags has 5 zippered pouches to hold numerous memory cards , spare batteries for the flash units , filters , and ( 1 ) David Busch 's Compact Field Guide for the Canon EOS 5D Mark IIin the rear pouch . Yes I managed to fit all that gear into the bag . Is it heavy but it works for me ! ! ! I do like the zippered main compartment . So far so good the bag is holding up nicely . I would I trust in this bag to keep my gear dry in a rainstorm ... no ! ! ! It 's designed to carry a lot of gear w/out falling apart ! I would recommend this to everyone ... .yes ! ! !	1
This is far smaller than expected . It will not hold two cameras and lenses . Only a body and very few accessories . Having said that , the build quality is excellent , or outstanding whichever is better . If you do not need a lot of equipment this bag is great . Camera with lens , flash , and a couple of smaller items will fit on the inside with pockets on the exterior for cards , cables or other small items .	1
I like it for the same reasons stated by other reviewers , so I wo n't repeat myself here . The part I worry about is something I discovered when I tried to adjust the dividers slightly & tried to rearrange one of them . As the velcro pulled on the fabric along the inner walls when I tried to separate them , the fabric stretched so much that I thought I would tear it . I also wonder how long the fabric will last after years of use and enduring climate changes . However , the outside of the bag is well constructed & provides sufficient space for the amateur camera enthusiast .	1
I purchased this bag to replace my smaller Canon bag 100 EG.The 100 EG was great for my XT and XTi but I needed to have a bag to hold my Canon 40D with a Canon 200mm lens attached.This bag holds the 40D and the 200mm with the power grip attached with plenty of room left.I was able to also put in 3 other Canon lenses , a 15mm , 28mm , and an 85mm with the 40D with power grip and 200mm lens attached . I do n't keep these lenses in the bag all the time , I just wanted to see what could fit in it.You customize the bag yourself as best you can for what stuff you need to put in it . I took out all the padded inserts at first , and position them in the bag as needed . Right now I am only using one insert.Front and side pouches hold extra batteries , remote cable release , and charger . I still have empty space . The material is the same as the 100 EG that I have used for a few years now without problem .	1
The Canon gadget bag 's fit and finish is top notch . Nice looking bag , well built and appears highly customizable . I have nothing to compare it to and have just started with photography . I left it in the default configuration which carries the camera body with no lens on one side followed across the bag by six individual compartments for lenses.So far so good - if anything changes with use , I will update the review .	1
Other reviewers have been nearly consistent here in praising the quality of the Canon 10EG . Many , however , have expressed disappointment with its size saying that it holds far less than Canon 's blurb suggest . ( 2 bodies and up to 8 lenses ) .Having worked as a pro for almost forty years , and having amassed a large collection of bags by most of the major makers , I can attest to the first point and possibly provide some context for the second.This bag WILL hold 2 Rebel-sized bodies and up to eight lenses , but only when arranged for storage , not quick access . This is how : Put one body over another with their body caps on without lenses attached or battery grips . One of the padded dividers is designed to go between the bodies and protect them . The eight lenses have to be either very small zooms or smaller single- focal length lenses and they too would have to be stacked one over another with caps on both ends , sans hoods.I used a similar set-up for years with a Nikon f3 system when I was traveling . It is slow and cumbersome , but doable and for some shoots very usable.But that said this is NOT what the 10EG is really designed to do best . Its real purpose is to provide excellent protection and quick access for a smaller system . The key to making it ideal for our individual set-up is to think 'out of the box ' when putting in the dividers.My own Rebel T2i system will in the end consist of four lenses . ( I presently own three of these ) Since I use the Rebel for quick grab-it-when-you-can shooting I placed the body - grip and 18-55 zoom attached - centered in the bag with the back of the camera rearward so it rest against my hip . My 55-250 lens sits in one upper corner , my 60 2.8 Macro in the other . Both are held in place by a single affixed divider curved around the lens . Smaller dividers create two more protected zones left and right of the camera body . One of these will hold the 10-22 zoom when I get it , the other ( possibly ) a small flash.I have posted a pic of the configuration in the picture section.Some have commented about the waist belt expressing the POV that it is largely useless and a waste of space . I disagree . It is to me beautifully designed to serve two important functions.1 ) It keeps the bag firmly fixed against the body under all circumstances . This allows for quicker ( and safer ) access and return when one needs to grab the camera or change a lens quickly in less than ideal circumstances.2 ) It will help prevent the most common type of theft the 'tourist ' typically is threatened by - especially in some southern European and Central American locations : The quick 'cut the shoulder strap and snatch ' maneuver so favored by crafty youth whose lively hood ( such as it is ) is based on victimizing unsuspecting tourists.I could not rate this bag more highly . And its price here on Amazon is half or a third of what I would have expected for a bag this well designed a well constucted . Wonderful !	1
This bag was exactly what I needed . The descriptions were spot on and the product arrived quickly . It easily holds my T2i with the standard zoom lens , motor drive 75-200 f4 L lens and it 's fairly sizeable lens shade . Extra batteries and charger fit well into the ample side pockets . Look no further for a trusty case . The front flap uses a rigid metal clip the secure it to the body of the bag . Fabulous design .	1
I know this product does n't have the best reviews , but I think it 's great ! I bought the S2 camera ( on Amazon ) , and this bag works JUST fine with it.I can get the camera , my extra batteries , and the wall adaptor all in the bag just fine : ) It 's a very sturdy bag to ! I would n't recommend it for a professional though , who has to carry around a lot of camera stuff . But for me , it worked great , and I recommend it : )	1
Product is of excellent built quality . It can not house 3 lenses with DSLR camera body ( in my opinion ) . I have Canon SL1 body , 18-55mm STM lens , 4 filters , extra battery , battery charger , SD card , cables , 1 prime lens placed inside this bag and in my opinion this bag can not have any more camera body or zoom lens . However it is a well built , compact and durable product which is excellent for the price . Shipping and packing was excellent . Zips , pockets and padding is remarkable . Overall a very good product . Only the product description is misleading otherwise deserves 5 stars . Will recommend to those who do n't want big bags or have less equipment ( DSLR camera and lens ) .	1
This is a finely made bag by Canon . It is n't spacious , but just big enough to fit my camera body , its kit lens , and a 55-250mm telephoto zoom ( each sectioned off using the included divider pads ) . Not to mention the front pouch is good for storing the charger and battery which fit in two perfectly sized internal pockets respectively . The rest affords room for lens cleaning patches , SD cards , cables , etc . It is put together mostly from a tough nylon-weave fabric with matching heavy-duty metal clips and zippers . The bag offers generous padding and features a hard bottom-insert with plastic feet that prevent the bag 's underside from coming into contact with a potentially dirty or wet surface . I also liked the oversized zipper flap that goes around the top and hangs over the front pouch . I can see how that would help if rain or liquid spills ever materialized . Oh , and just to top it off : there is an integrated belt in the back you can pull out or hide behind a nylon surface that looks so inconspicuous I was n't aware of its existence for several days .	1
It 's got plenty of room for your camera and two lenses , plus all your extras ( battery charger , cleaning pen , ect. ) . I would highly recommend this to all photographers ! Fast shipping too !	1
Bought this at a great price , it fits my camera with a lens attached , plus a second telezoom lens and the charger with extra battery and a micro tripod .	1
I got this bag , it is very Robust , Even better than LowePro one ... ... .. I sold it because of my new lens ( 70-200 mm one ) . But build is execellent , it can maintain in any condition . Go for it	1
Useful and safe way to transport your gear.I would have bought one size bigger had I known how much gear I would accumulate to carry.A well made and fairly priced bag nonetheless .	1
I had to return this bag because it was too bulky for my needs . I wanted to carry my video camcorder ( Canon M30 and Canon SX20 ) together , which it can but it is so wide ( width ) ; 7-8 inches ! However , it is an excellent quality bag that could easily cost twice as much . Very well made ; material , zippers , straps are all 1st class . Inside dimensions are 8.5-9 `` , 6.5-7 '' height and 6 '' width . Has a large front pocket .	1
This bag is nice looking and keeps all my gear secure . I have a Canon SX40 camera , Flash , spare battery , and cleaning cloth and pen which all fit nicely in the bag . The bag is well made with solid zippers and removable carry strap .	1
Excellent quality bag . This is great if you like to travel light . The padding on the strap is curved which does n't make sense to me but whatever .	1
I 'm the amateur photographer , and for my needs , this camera bag is perfect ! It securely holds my Canon Rebel 2000 , and has room for two lenses . The dividers in the main compartment are well padded , and they fold over , I suppose for extra padding , or for protection on top . The bag also has a zipper pouch in each of its front and top compartments , for holding little extras like film , wallet , etc . Being an amateur , film , my camera , and a lens or two is all I need to take pictures , a professional might desire a larger bag that can hold more items.The bag is good looking , and has a nice solid construction , the material feels as if it will hold up to years of use . The details in this bag really impressed me . It has two plastic feet on the bottom for added stability , the clips and rings are all made of black metal , rather than plastic , it has a nicely hidden strap to convert it into a waist pack ( though I find it a bit bulky to wear that way ) , the bottom padding is removable and is hard sided for extra protection . Altogether , this is a great bag for the cost , and I 'm sure it 'll come in handy for carrying things besides my camera .	1
Everything fits perfectly in the bag ! Canon T5 body , 18-55 IS and 55-250 IS lenses , filter kit , extra batteries and charger . Shoulder and waist straps included .	1
Others say the bag will not hold what it claims and indeed it still comes with a tag claiming 1-2 bodies and 3-4 lens . Now , read between the lines . It does not say 2 cameras and 4 lens . That hedge probably means 1 camera and 4 lens or 2 cameras and 3 lens . Depends on size of cameras and lens , right ! Here is what I got in it as a test . Not sure it is what I will carry as it is not easy to whip out to take a photo - more on what I really will carry in a moment . Depends if you are talking pure `` storage '' or space to pull out a camera ready for action on an actual photo shoot . It comes with two padded , moveable partitions held in place with velcro that have a flap on the top . I suppose they could be held in place vertically as I have done or horizontally . I stored a Canon T2i body on the left side , a partition , then a Canon G1 Powershot , another partition , then a 55-250mm lens on the bottom , the partition flap over it , then the 18-55mm kit lens on top . The flap from the left partition lays over the G1 leaving top of the T2i exposed . A piece of bubble wrap could lay on top of the T2i . Then , I could set my lens shade and G1 lens extender on top of that , as well as the battery pack for the T2i . Now that is a bunch of stuff and ideal if I want to transport a lot of stuff on a trip . I can even put two battery chargers , one for each camera , plus a couple of extra batteries in the front pouch with room for several memory cards in the top inside cover . Now that gets me to where I am going , but not so convenient for popping out a camera for immediate action.My tests also say that you could put a T2i body on the left and get four lens sitting vertically , maybe horizontally , depending on size of course . Anything over my 55-250mm in length or width would be problematic in that scenario , but if not trying to cram that much in , something wider would fit . You could also sit the T2i , or another in that series upright with a longer lens attached and still have room to place at least one more on the right.On a shoot , I may carry my old backup G1 in my cargo pants . What I intend to carry on a shoot in this camera bag , most likely , is the T2i on the left with battery pack installed , facing up ( LCD screen down ) with kit lens installed , then one partition with the 55-250mm lens lying down on the right side . With the partition 's flap down , the lens shade sits on top . When I want to take a normal photo , I just reach in and grab the camera . True , the lens shade just can not fit on the lens whether the lens is sitting vertical or horizontal in the bag unless perhaps you have it installed on the T2i and camera is upright , not vertical as I plan - have not tried that scenario . Perhaps the kit lens could still fit under it . To me that is the only flaw . I have to screw that on any time I need it . I will have a polarizing filter and UV filters installed also . Do not let anyone tell you the t2i battery pack will not fit in this bag while on or off the camera - not true . Snug , maybe , but do you want any of this flopping around ? Not me ! I have not given this a water test - may just give it a spray with some Scotch-Guard to be on the safe side as I will spend time with it in the outdoors and setting it on possibly damp ground . Sharp looking ! Would not hesitate to buy it again ! The bag appears very well made . The shoulder strap looks sturdy and well padded . I will get a chance to test it in an airport setting in a week and have a few days of intense photography over several days as all my gear is new . Exciting ! 7/22/13 UpdateI stand corrected about the lens hood . Just discovered I can put the hood on my Canon 50-250mm lens , place it hood down vertically in the bag and it will still close fine , snug , but close . Previously I had it hood UP . For some reason that was more awkward . Plus , now I can insert a second battery charger next to the lens , or I can add my 7 '' Aputure Timer Remote Control . And , since I am still learning this camera , really a mini-computer , if you will , I can put the 3/8 '' thick instruction book in the mesh sleeve inside the top flap and it still all closes . I am totally amazed with this bag . No need for a shoe horn to get stuff in or out , but I think I have room still for a shoe horn in the front pocket if needed . Disclaimer : I do n't work for Amazon or Canon although my glowing praise may make it sound as if I do .	1
This bag easily accomodates my new Canon S3 IS , along with the lens adapter and hood , with room to spare . Recently , during a trip to Europe , I was also able to fit several other items into the bag : a rechargeable battery charger , AC adapter , and outlet adapter , along with two sets of rechargeable batteries , as well as a UV filter , and I still had room for more . I 've no doubt the wide- and tele-converters for this camera would also have fit , with room to spare .	1
Nice bag , Carry 's my camera with standard lens attached and my telephoto . Pockets work for smaller items like filters and manuals . Sturdy , seems like it should last . Easy to carry along with shoulder strap or handle .	1
The back is light weight , nicely padded throughout to protect your lens and camera . I like the pouch in the front portion of the back , good space for the battery charger and cable . When you open the main compartment , you will find a zippered pouch for small items such as your lightning bolt connector for your IPAD to transfer pics from your media card along with other small items you may choose to carry.It is easy to clean when it gets dusty from being out hiking . The dividers are nicely padded , although somewhat frustrating to remove and move to change the compartment sizes . However , not a reason at all to avoid this bag.My only reason for not giving this bag 5 stars is that the strap is a little short for a big person as myself . I wish the strap was longer to accommodate a better hang from my shoulder . The solution I found is to replace the strap that come with the bag with another strap I borrowed from my laptop/office messenger bag.Great price for an Very Nice bag . I would not hesitate to recommend .	1
this bag is pretty awsome it protected my camera in the rain its got alot of extra pockets and a seperator inside for lenses and camera body .	1
CHECK THE PRODUCT PHOTOS - The description for this bag IS poorly written and should include the word `` OR '' a few more times when describing what all it will fit . I suspect for a veteran photographer with more gear , this bag would fall short except for limited use.With that said , I just purchased my first DSLR package and needed some way pack it around . This bag does the job well . It holds my Canon T2i camera body , two lenses ( 18-55mm , 75-300mm ) , and extras like an auto/wall charger ( not the Canon charger w/cable ) , the book , an extra battery , an extra memory card and a 3 piece Lenspen Pro-kit . I can put this bag fully loaded inside an Under Armour Adult Varsity backpack with my tablet , phone , and a rolled up light jacket.The bag itself seems very well constructed . Strap and flap clips are metal and very solid . The bag has a shoulder strap AND a waist strap ( hidden in a flap on the back of the bag ) . I 'm not a fan of waist-pack style bags , but it 's a nice option.This wo n't be the last camera/gadget bag I buy , but it 's a great bag to start .	1
I love my case . It holds my 250mm zoom lens along with necessary pocket for extra battery and memory card and any cords that might be necessary . Of course the DSLR camera with my 18-55mm lens attached fits in as well . There is a long strap for carrying plus you can attach it to your waistband if you prefer . I wish it were slightly larger in the eventuality I might get a larger zoom lens . On the plus side , it fits easily into my Swiss Army backpack when flying . These days travelers can only take one personal item to keep at their feet and one carry-on for the overhead bin . If you are like me , you do n't ever want to check your IPAD , camera , cell phone , IPOD , GPS and all accompnaying chargers in your checked baggage , so it 's nice to know a camera bag like this will easily fit into that single carry-on backpack or other tote bag . No worries about safety then .	1
Works great for the Canon EOS Rebel T4i . You can fit the camera , a second lens , cable stuff , battery and screen protectors or whatever you want . Even a space for my iPhone 5 is provided . Very nice bag and also nice and fast shipping !	1
I got this bag I did n't want a big one I want something that I could carry aroundIt 's not small eighter I have three lense large medium small lens and k30 PentaxCamera it fits just right Nice bag recommed it	1
Amazing construction , heavy metal zippers and clasps and thick material makes me feel safe keeping my new DSLR in it . Shoulder strap is nice , could probably fit my amateur body and 2 med-small lenses in it , say the kit lens and a 50mm with ease , could probably squeeze in another if I kept one on the camera . Pretty good price for something so well-made , would buy again .	1
Unfortunately this bag was too small for my camera . ( Canon Rebel T3i ) . I had to return it and order another bag . It was nice looking and perfect for a small camera .	1
UPS drop off at my door on 12/19/12 @ 6:50 PM ! Bag is excellence size for what I wanted for my Canon Powershot SX 40hs , charger , flash and small stuff all fit nicely.padded bag . I have been looking for months for this . Was not sure at first about the size now I highly recommend for Canon Powershot cameras . Thank you for the speedy service	1
I bought this gear bag based on reviews I read and most said this bag was huge so I was a bit surprised at how small it is . My fault for not double checking the dimensions . I guess if you 're using a point and shoot , then it is huge . A bit small for a DSLR though . The tag claims it will hold 2 bodies and 3-4 lenses but I do n't know how this is possible . It barely holds my EOS XS with two zoom lenses and Albinar 90 MDT-Z strobe in the main compartment . Neither lens is really very big . I 'm not sure how it would hold 2 bodies and 3-4 lenses but it does what I need it to do and that 's really all that matters.The build quality is superb and I expect this to last a long time . The strap clips and attachments are metal , not plastic , and the zippers are large and heavy duty . Though they are made of nylon , they appear very robust . The main compartment layout is adjustable with very nice padded detachable dividers and the gear is very well protected . The dividers fold over on the top for a layered effect which is how my strobe fits over the lenses and body . Overall , I am very satisfied with this bag . For the money , it really ca n't be beat . Just make sure you check the dimensions and match them to your gear and needs .	1
Huge Bag ordered as a birthday gift for Canon Rebel Camera seem to hold the camera securely and still have room for camera supplies	1
The above reviews sum it up well- I have a 500D body , 18-35mm lens , 75-300mm lens , macro filters , and a remote for the camera . It fits just so , and it 's definitely NOT a 'grab something out real quick ' or 'throw everything back in and run ' kind of bag . However , other than that , this thing is solid- it is not made cheaply , which is great . The zippers and latches are all metal , not plastic . The pouch up front fits a spare battery and all my charging cables .	1
This is a very good Cannon camera bag and was purchased with a new Canon EOS T3 . Camera fits well with 300mm zoom .	1
Great Bag !	1
Only store my T4i and the charger , do n't have multiple lens so I ca n't comment on if there is adequate amount of space , but it seems like I could definitely fit another lens in there .	1
This is a great bag for a Canon S5 IS or one of its brethren . You can easily fit it with a Lensmate adapter and a couple of other adapters . Also holds other accessories . It offers the ability to carry it by a handle , shoulder strap , or a cleverly executed fanny pack . Construction is good , with heavy duty zippers . If you are getting it for a DSLR , you may be disappointed . It is too small to carry one unless it just has one small lens attached . You would do well to look to a larger bag . To carry a camera like the S5 and all its gear , you ca n't go wrong , though . The only thing that would improve it is a couple of compartments on the side of the bag .	1
& # 2951 ; Fuzzy Wuzzy 's Summary : & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; & # 1150 ; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies ! Canon packages their macro ring lites with an EOS camera and macro lens for use by dentists for good reason : for close-up macro photography inside someone 's mouth where you want to be able to either avoid or control shadowing effects , this is an indispensable flash that provides better close-up illumination than you can get with just a hot shoe flash . I am using this on an EOS 30D ( updated posting : and also 40D ) with their excellentCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR CamerasandCanon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Lens for Canon SLR Camerasalong with aCanon Macrolite Adapter 58C for Canon G2 , G3 , G5 , G6 & Pro1 Digital CamerasEven though the `` Canon Macrolite Adapter 58C '' says that it is for G2-G6 cameras , it fits their 65mm and 100mm Macro Lens also due to its 58mm size . The flash secures onto grooves in their 100mm Macro Lens , but if you prefer to leave a UV-haze filter on that lens , the filter covers up the groove . Therefore , to not have to remove the protective UV-haze filter lens in order to attach the ring lite , you need to screw the `` Canon Macrolite Adapter 58C '' onto the end of the filter lens , which then provides the grooves that the ring lite then attaches to . Yes , $ 15 is still a bit pricey for a skinny little ring of plastic adapter , but comparable to how Canon prices their lens hoods also ... and it is the only way to attach the ring lite to the macro lens while still leaving a UV-haze filter screwed on ( without resorting to black duck tape : - ) I use this ring lite for both indoor and outdoor nature macro photography and it is the perfect flash when the natural lighting is less than optimal . A macro ring light like this is optional equipment if you use Canon 's 50mm , 60mm , 100mm , or 180mm macro lenses . But either this flash or the more expensiveCanon MT-24EX Macro Twin Lite Flash for Canon Digital SLR Camerasmacro flash is really absolutely required equipment if you use theCanon MP-E 65mm f/2.8 1-5X Macro Lens for Canon SLR Cameraslens , especially if you do not always use a tripod . The diffuser plastic that is on this flash gives it a nice soft warm light that is not too harsh . You can adjust the `` ratio '' so that one of the half-circle ring 's flashes are brighter than the other half-circle flash , to get better shadow contrast ( when zooming the MP-E 65mm between 3X to 5X , I like to use a ratio of 3:1 or 4:1 ) . The MT-24EX does have a distinct advantage over this MR-14EX when using Canon 's MP-E 65mm at magnifications of 4X or 5X because the MT-24EX 's two flash heads can be positioned and angled more directly at the subject . But I find the MT-24EX 's light to be more harsh than this MR-14EX , unless you create your own diffuser setup for it.July 22 2010 update : Since my original writing of my review , I sold myCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Camerasand bought the newerCanon EF 100mm f/2.8L IS USM 1-to-1 Macro Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras . In order to use this new version of Canon 's 100mm macro lens with the MR-14EX , you need to also purchase the pricyCanon Macrolite Adapter 67 .	1
This unti is used with my EF 100mm Macro . Great lighting and also triggers my 430EXII used to back light the subject .	1
it 's OK.over pricey , very heavy , blocks your view , I wish if they make it wireless instead.but it 's a genuine canon .	1
I notice another reviewer called the Speedlite 220 the perfect companion for your G1 ; I thought of it as the perfect companion for my G2 . Whichever camera you have , the Speedlite 220 is indeed the perfect way to get better illuminated flash photos and extend battery life in your G-series camera.The single most important thing you can do to get rid of red eye and insure that your flash photography subjects do n't have that flat , pasty-faced , deer-caught-in-the-headlights look is to seperate the camera from the flash . ( You 'll need Canon 's off-camera extension cord for this ) You can shoot with the camera in one hand and hold the flash in the other , or use a bracket to hold them . Or you can get creative , bouncing the flash off the walls , lighting behind your subject , etc . It 's great for providing fill flash on sunny days , lighting shadows- and with digital cameras it costs you next to nothing to experiment with lighting and get immidiate feedback.The 220 talks to all the G-series cameras ( as well as all modern Canon SLRs ) so you can concentrate on lighting and composition and let the camera worry about exposure . Add a couple sets of rechargeable AA cells and a small charger- cheap these days- and you have an inexpensive but powerful lighting studio . Some may recoil at the price- after all , you can get a tiny flash unit for half or a quarter the cost- but the ability to integrate withe the camera electronics are well worth it .	1
Unless you can convince yourself that you need the features of higher models ( such as the 430EX ) , this is a great flash . It is very simple - turn it on , take the picture , turn it off.It seems to be a little less harsh than the popup flash on my Rebel XT . it also claims to be a little more powerful than the popup flash . Finally , I have lens hoods on a few of my lenses . Thus , the popup flash often creates a `` shadow '' . This flash takes care of that problem.If you fall somewhere between being a clueless photographer who has no idea what this flash might do for you , but are short of an overeager hobbyist who might want to fiddle around with more advanced features , then this is a good flash.It does not swivel or tilt , but I do n't care about that . I mainly wanted a little more power than my popup/builtin flash and I wanted to get above my lens hoods to prevent shadowing . This flash works for me.I give it 4 stars b/c there seems to be a notable reduction in light output if you take rapid fire shots .	1
my only gripe is this ; i bought this remote to take pictures without having to touch the shutter button ( to avoid camera shake ) the remote only works if it is pointed at the sensor in the front of the camera . you could be less than an inch from the sensor , but if it is not facing the front of the camera , it wont take . i know i could have bought one of the corded remotes , but i like to use the remote for taking family pics too ( i dont have to run to get in place every time ) it 's not a big deal , it still works great .	1
Very nice little gadget that makes taking photos so much easier while the camera is on the tripod . I do wish it was easier to see the on/off switch , ( the switch is black and written with black lettering on a black remote ) , and would be nice if the shutter release button was better situated , but overall this is a very convenient , handy little remote for the Xsi	1
The Canon RC-1 Wireless Remote stores attached to the camera strap so it 's always handy . It is perfect for close-up and long exposure shots when camera shake might be a problem . It 's also great if you want to get in the picture . The downside for this ( and most infrared remotes ) is its limited range and susceptibility to some outdoor settings .	1
Do n't fuss with any other remotes or wired shutter releases . This thing is awesome . It even threads through your camera strap . It 's easy to use and works seamlessly with my Canon Rebel XT . A must for anyone shooting with a tripod . I highly recommend getting it .	1
I decided to buy this remotre control after I got $ 10 gift certificate - so I was n't able to leave it here for $ 15 ! It is good piece of plastic ! It is very small remote but nothing is missing . The cool things I like is , you can simply add it to your strap ( You may have little bit problem to put it in because there is not enough space but after little bit of playing , you can do it ! ) . This small light black bloc has small red button to release the remote from the strap . Remote is small . In his inside side is small shutter button and you can choose from OFF , Normal Picture , or 2 Seconds delay picture . Second cool thing is , you can use the holder on the strap under your big heavy zoom lens . It is made for it and I think it is nice ! You may have problem , because the strap is so short but it is possible to do it . I think Canon made this little thing very well and did n't forget anything . It is small , light , useful and helpful ! One thing I would appreciate to be better is the actual remote button . You have to really reach the chip on your camera to activate the Shutter . The length is good enough but pressing it like from a sid ( especially right side ) is little bit complicated . But I am glad I bought it ! It is good help !	1
This is a great remote . If you have ever found it annoying having to set a timer and then run to get in the picture , this can help you out immensely . Just a quick click of the button , 2 seconds later , *shutter sound . * It is especially useful when taking low light photos on a tripod . You do n't get any shake from pushing the button , and you dont have to wait for the timed clicks either . If you think you can use it , you probably can . If you do n't think you can use it , it is probably still worth the 20 dollars .	1
It took a minute to get the hang of the adjustments needed to the camera , but after that ( 10 mins ) I was all smiles . Great little gadget .	1
I asked this question at a local camera shop , and ignited a huge discussion between the five employees there . The answer ? No one knows . Just some mumblings about the RC5 being targeted towards point-and-shoot guys.Do n't know , but they seem to work the same . Maybe the RC5 is smaller.Either works great ! I use my RC5 for super-still tripod shots .	1
I got this to reduce camera shake and have been very pleased with it . once the camera is on a tripod I just use the remote for every picture . the carry case hooks on to the camera strap and its so lite you forget it 's there . Highly recomend this .	1
Works as advertised with my XSi ( 450D ) . It was a lot smaller than I expected , about the length and width of my thumb . It 's so light weight I 'd say that it 's about the same as a ballpoint pen . It comes with a holder/base that can be threaded onto a 3/8 inch strap so you do n't lose the small item . The clip that secures the remote to the base feels flimsy due to the light weight , but there are not any gaps which may snag an errant object . In agreement with the other reviews , the toggle between off/instant/delay is very small and definitely not accessible to fat fingers or gloves . One other thing , you 'll need to stand to the right of the frame to point the remote at the IR receiver . Standing on the left , sometimes the lens will block the line of sight . Similarly if you 're tilting the camera on a tripod , sometimes the IR receiver wo n't be in your line of sight . However , compared to the cost of an wireless setup , which cost about 80 dollars more , this device is cost effective despite the deficiencies mentioned.My decision came down to this product versus the Opteka RC-4 . The difference was only 10 dollars , so I splurged . However , only 4 stars because the thing feels so flimsy and the aforementioned limitations .	1
It 's a very usefull divice , but It do n't have a focus function , and only two shoot settings , direct shoot and 2 seconds delay .	1
We purchased this product to take macro close up photography of small items to sell at online auction . The motion of pushing the button to take a picture moved the camera enough to blur the photo , even with a tripod . This little gem made taking the picture a hands-free job , no more blur !	1
When something works as it is supposed to , and then it also has an elegant form to it , I will always give it five stars . I have used this remote a lot , and this is actually my second one for a second Canon camera . I consider it to be an essential tool for the camera . Indeed , it probably should come as a standard feature . If you have any use for a remote at all , do n't hesitate to buy it . The batteries last well and are a common hearing aid battery , easily found in stores , cheap to replace when you need it , if you need it . Mine last years ! It clips to the camera strap , is innocuous when it is there , and therefore it is always handy . I use my camera for work and pleasure , and this item is indispensable for all of it . When we are traveling my wife likes to have photos of us taken together , and with a small portable tripod or monopod , I can usually prop the camera up and get a shot of us standing together without having to bother a passer-by who will usually screw up the photo anyway . You press the button to how long you want it to `` lapse '' before it actually snaps the photo , that being adjustable , giving you quite a bit of time to pose if you want it . I even took photos at my own wedding using it . Are you getting it yet ? Very useful , flexible , well designed .	1
You have to get one of these . It works very well , if you are shooting portraits , macros or self portraits , this remote awesome tool to have it . I use it all the time . Unless if I need burst , this is a perfect for tripod single shots of any kind : ) If you buy after you read my review , I will have your bless : )	1
Can attach to the strap using the companion plate , very handy , 3 modes ( lock , instant , 2 seconds delay ) . Tripod , this remote timer & mirror lock-up can make some amazing pictures .	1
Once I figured out that I had to hold the remote off to the side and to the left of the camera ( facing me ) in order to get it to work , it worked fine . Might have been nice if the instructions included that little tidbit of helpful info , since I thought the thing was broken when I tried to use it with my right hand and it only worked one out of 10 times .	1
I 've had this remote now for about 2 weeks and have used it several times for a beginning photography class I am taking and our first assignment was taking self-portraits . If you are taking self-portraits or group photos with you in them in a well-lit scene , then this remote is perfect . I have found that you DO need to point the remote pretty much directly at the sensor on your camera ( so that will be just to the left of the lens as you face your camera ) . It does not seem to register the click from any other angle . And as I stated , there MUST be good lighting to use it . I tried a few shots in a candle-lit setting and the remote did NOT work . The camera sensor does n't seem to be able to pick it up in darkened situations . So if you want something for more than self-portraits in any lighting condition and at any angle from farther than 15 ft , then you should get a remote that uses radio frequencies , but I think those cost upwards of $ 100+ . And one more note , this remote comes with a plastic cover that you will want to keep on it when not in use because it prevents the button from being accidentally pressed if you have it stored tightly in with all of your other equipment . My friend learned this the hard way when he pulled it out to use it and the batteries were dead because some of his other equipment happened to be pressing against the button when he had it in his pack .	1
It works what suppose to be . But I need to be infront of camera within about 20 degree viewing angles and within about 20 feet . I no longer need to run to get my self in the picture like in old timer .	1
Wish I bought this sooner . This is wonderful for taking photographs of yourself on trips . I had my camera for a long while , and have only rarly taken pictures of myself on my trips . I end up coming back with pictures of my wife , the scenery ... but rarely myself . This remote changed it . The reason I dont give it 5 stars is that you need to be relatively close to the camera . Wish it worked from a greater distance . Also , it would have been nicer if it was radio-controlled rather than infra-red . In order for it to work , I have to stand on one side , in direct line of sight of the sensor . Not a big deal , but you have to take this into account when positioning yourself in a group .	1
The device came quickly , and works as advertised . Limited to about 15 feet . Works on 5D2 and 500D . Drawback : receiving sensor is on front only ! Plus : Cheap !	1
This has been working great since it arrived . I have not had many problems at all with having to find the right angle . Just aim and shot .	1
Smaller than a tube of chapstick , this remote toggle is easy and fun . You do n't have to worry about losing it , because it has an attachment to your camera photo strap , so it is always with you when you need it . This great little tool has worked great for me every time I have needed it , and it has been a fun way to take self portraits in different lights , with different settings - with camera mounted to a tripod of course . All of this has meant that I am able to self-teach my camera 's many features.It comes with a small battery that looks like a watch battery , etc . I guess I will be going to radio shack for a replacement when the time comes , but for now , it has been a fun little tool or toy that would make a great gift for that photographer in your life !	1
THE REMOTE WORKS GREAT WITH A CANON XSI ! ! HELPED ME TO IMPROVE MY SHOOTING ON A TRIPODupdate : : : 07/26/2010This little gadget has been a joy to own ... not much to know as far as using it and it has helped me to take some stunning shots both on tripods and sandbags etc . It is very good for long exposure shots on a tripod .. I really like using it for HDR captures when i set up a 3 shot exposure .. i find then when i go to align the 3 shots later there is less post work needed to be done and the clarity is better overall . The distance is fine and I would still suggest to others thinking about this to get it and use it oftenupdate : : : 03/21/2012Still using this a lot and I have yet to replace even the batteries in it ! ! ! Works awesome and would tell everyone to get it ! !	1
Works only when pointed directly at the front of the camera . Otherwise ... a great product . A must if you do not have a IS lens and want to shoot at higher focal lengths .	1
Does what it 's supposed to . I wish it was wireless , but that option is not available for my model camera , unfortunately .	1
Works as expected . Just way too short of a cord but very fix able if you have an Radio Shack close by . I picked up the following and now have an extra 20 ft now to the shutter button.Get the following.1 - 2740397 - 3/32 '' SPG-1/8 '' SJK1- 2740373 - 1/8SPG-3/32 '' SJK1 - 4202562 - GP,20FT 1/8INST EXTEverything is working excellent now , have 20ft extra to take pictures . I believe there is a 50ft ext cord as well available.Cheers , azbobs	1
This is a must have shutter release for anyone really . Obviously it 's great for long exposure shots to reduce shake , but it 's also great because you can lock it on BULB or to take continuous shots at any shutter speed . I 've had my Canon RS60 for about 5 years and it 's still working . Originally got it for my Rebel 2000 and carried it over when I got my Rebel XSi . It 's an absolute must have . I also have the Canon RC-6 wireless remote and I can say that it 's really only designed for that one person who never makes into the group photo . In order to use the RC-6 you have to hit the infrared sensor from the front and it can only be synced with the camera with a shutter delay . That 's why the RS60 is much better than the RC-6 .	1
Not complicated ... push half way to focus , all the way to release shutter , slide up for extended open shutter ( bulb mode ) . Easy peasy . I did n't even look at the manual .	1
If you are doing true macro or long telephoto work this is an absolute necessity , along with mirror lockup , for sharp photos . The only real alternative being the self timer , but that does not give you any real composition control if your subject is moving . This is also nice for portrait work because it lets you interact with your subjects without having your head and hands right near the camera ( use your eyepiece over to avoid stray light from tricking your sensor when doing this . )	1
I purchased this to use with my Canon Powershot SX50 HS , so I could remotely trigger the shutter on long zoom shots while having the camera mounted on a tripod . I wanted this in order to prevent any camera shake ( and the resulting blurry image ) , without having to resort to using a timer on the camera itself . The remote does exactly what you would expect , it triggers the shutter on the camera , and since it does n't require batteries , is always ready to be put to work without any fuss . It works really well and overall , am very happy I purchased it.The cable is very short , which is n't much of an issue when you 're standing right at the camera , but if you want to move away from the camera at all , then the short cable becomes more of a liability . This is easily ( and cheaply ) remedied by purchasing a 2.5mm headphone extension cable . I went with theYour Cable Store 12 Foot 2.5mm Stereo Headphone Extension Cable ( available here on Amazon for under $ 7 at the time of this writing ) , which now gives me a combined cable length of 14 feet . That said , the short length of the cable is the primary reason for me knocking off a star . Other than the short cable , this is a good , quality remote shutter switch for supported Canon cameras , including the Powershot SX50 HS , and I have no problem recommending it to anyone who has a supported camera ( though I would recommend picking up an extension cable at the same time , just to make your life easier . )	1
I 've used this remote a number of times already and it works perfectly . I like that he cord is long enough but not TOO long .	1
If you are shooting landscapes , macro shots , stacking shots , nightshots , you get where I 'm going ... you need this . It 's made by Canon and it is a little spendy for such a small item but it 's worth it . It has n't failed me yet and I 've been using it now for two years almost every day . I recommend this . I did research the wireless remotes but in order to use them sometimes they dow n't work unless you are to the direct side or in front of the camera . That does n't work for me .	1
I am so pleased with this wired shutter release , it enables me to setup my camera on a tri pod and shoot a picture and know that the expose will be rock solid . I love this device and throughly recommend it .	1
This remote works perfect with my canon rebel t2i . I use it on when i shoot on bulb mode for long exposures .	1
I originally did n't know that such an item would mate with my Canon camera . After reading the reviews , and checking with my owner 's manual , I decided to take a chance . It was a great choice and I have no regrets at all . It is just the thing for close-up shooting that lets me move away from the camera . A real need for anyone who needs to assure no shake while taking a picture . A great find at a great price .	1
This thing is mainly useful for bulb exposures ( you have to manually lock the shutter and unlock it when you have completed the exposure time , it doesnt count the time since it doesnt have any procesors or logical electronics inside ) . Another thing it may work great is to be taking pictures with the camera mounted on a tripod when you dont want to move it even by the shutter button being pushed.It works just great for those two things . The remote has a shape to make easy to roll the cable around it in the bottom has a little hole to `` connect '' the cable so that it can be stored without the cable going everywhere , its kinda clever . I would recommend this product if this is what you want it for and if you dont want to spend much .	1
I bought this to use with an EOS Rebel XSi and it does exactly what it should do . I 've always successfully used it to take some really nice astronomy and wildlife shots . It 's a must for tripod and telephoto shots . The switch attaches quickly and is easy to use.This is a necessary accessory and is always in the bag and goes with me whenever I travel with the camera and tripod .	1
A must have for anyone doing long exposure photography . I use it for taking photos of the night sky with my T3iEasy to use and well built , the only con - it 's a little small for my hand , not a big deal though , very happy with this product ... .	1
I use mine all the time for macro and longer exposure . Plug and go . Press half way down and it focuses , all the way down and it takes the shot . I have had mine for over 10 years and the housing finally came loose and would n't stay together . Wrapped a rubber band around the housing and it 's still going strong .	1
Overall , its a pretty cool little product . I bought the corded Remote Shutter Release because , I find the wireless one do n't work as well . Great Purchase .	1
The remote switch works as it should and gives you enough cord length to avoid moving the camera when you wish to use it .	1
I used this remote while shooting photo 's of kids at our YMCA Santa Day , while on a tripod . It worked great and the photo 's came out fantastic . It is now always in my bag when I need to use the tripod .	1
Nothing wrong with the switch and functions , but for my purposes I needed one longer to get away from the wildlife . I knew it was short when I bought it so it met my expectations and I already knew how to extend it with adapters and an additional extension cord so I 'm happy with it . Now I can hide ten feet away and snap pictures of birds , etc without leaving my blind or spooking the wildlife by setting up too close .	1
I always use a remote when shooting on a tripod and sometimes when i 'm not . I like to shoot evening and night shots . With a remote I get less vibration which is a killer for long exposures . This is my second remote ( for a different camera ) . I 've had the first one for about 3 years and have never had a problems of any kind with it . You can pre-focus with this remote as the button goes half-way down just like your shutter , or you can push it all the way down if you are manual focused . There is no risk of radio interference from other photographers with a wired remote . The length of the cable is adequate for most all situations . I keep the remote in a ziplock baggie in my camera case at all times .	1
This switch is just what I needed for long exposures and low light photographs using a tripod . I like he fact that you can stand behind the camera and take the photograph . This easy and simple to use .	1
It does the job , would be better if it was wireless , or at least if the cord was longer , but I like it , it works for me ...	1
The switch is easy to install on and remove from the camera . It functions well . It is well designed ; the shape makes it easy to hold . The trigger button works smoothly . I especially like that it 's designed for the cable to be wound around the body of the switch and cable stores into the notches to keep it wound . There 's also a storage location for the plug . Good design .	1
This is a great inexpensive alternative to the & # 34 ; official & # 34 ; Pentax remote . I use this with my K-5 all the time and it works like a charm . It 's very sturdily built as well and should last me quite some time .	1
Above average camera . Overall , a good starter digital camera . The pictures are great , with color reproduction being its greatest strength . In addition , as many reviewers attest to , this camera is easy to set-up and use right out of the box . No problems with the software installation , although I quickly uninstalled the included Arcsoft PhotoImpression . Quirky interface and useability issues . The LCD is more than adequate , and unlike some reviewers , I actually had no issues with battery life . I got 40+ pics from the included alkalines and have been using rechargeables since then with well over 100 pics before recharge . Pretty much what I expected from a digital camera . The menu system is easy to navigate , but some settings that I use more often , such as resolution and compression , should have quick buttons on the camera to make switching back and forth easier.My biggest complaint is with the zoom . I knew what I was getting with the 2x zoom , and it has been a limitation at times . Wish it was a true 3x or greater mechanical zoom . In addition , the zoom settings are not variable like a true SLR . Also , as I get more used to the camera , I wish I had greater control over more manual settings.Thus my overall conclusion is that this is a good & quot ; starter & quot ; digital camera , although one could argue that $ 399 is a little pricey for your first digitial camera . What makes the price more justifiable to me was the quality of the highest resolution pictures . They are great , leaving only some camera features as limitations.Pros : Great color reproduction . High resolution pictures are excellent . Easy to set-up and use out of the box.Cons : Limited mechanical zoom ( 2x ) . Limited manual adjustments .	1
The 3400 is a very solid 2 megapixel camera , but so too is the 280 . Sowhy spend at least 25 % more on the 3400 ? In terms of features , itoffers almost nothing to recommend it . The fact is a camera in thisquality range should not cost this much . If you want an all-around 2meg digital , check out the 280 ; if you want a more limited ( but stillvery functional ) digital camera for mostly internet apps , look at the3200 ( 1/2 the price ) . If you want 35mm quality , controls and feel , look at the 4800 ( twice the price ) .	1
I upgraded from the Olympus D460Zoom to the D490Zoom . The D460 is a fine camera - I was generally very pleased with it . But having owned the D460Zoom for six months , I found two major faults . First , the & quot ; boot-up time & quot ; ( how quickly after you turn the camera on that it is ready to shoot ) and the lack of & quot ; burst & quot ; shooting ( the ability to take one shot quickly after another ) . These two faults lead to frustration when trying to take any type of action photos with the D460 . You see the action emerging , but the camera is still booting up ; you take a shot , but the action gets better and you want to take another but the D460 says & quot ; not yet & quot ; because it is still writing the first photo to the media . Infuriating.The D490 addresses each of these problems beautifully . Boot up time is about 20 % faster . Timing both of my cameras side-by-side , the D490 is faster ( 1.1 seconds versus 1.3 seconds , in five trials using the same 32Mb media cards ) . More important than boot up time is burst shooting . The D490 has a RAM buffer that allows you to take about 1 shot per second in the & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode ( 2.1 megapixels with JPEG compression ) . The D460 requires about 2.5 seconds between shoots in the same & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode ( but the resolution is 1.3 megapixels ) . Also nifty if you are using the TFT screen to take shots , there is a & quot ; gas gauge & quot ; showing you how full the memory buffer is as you are shooting.I simply ca n't express how happy these faster response time made me , especially at this price . I was so unhappy with the D460 's sluggishness that I was about to buy the $ 900 Olympus C3030 . Similar to the C3030 , the D490 also can take QuickTime movies ( though much shorter ones ) . Another nice D490 feature is that you can erase all photos off a card while the card is still in the camera , instead of having to do the erasing on your computer ( I often forget to erase after downloading to the computer , put the media card back in and find it still full when I want to take more pictures ) .While the D490 lacks the C3030 's B & amp ; W options it does have the two more important features - the QuickTime movies and the burst shooting ( both admittedly not as good as the C3030 , but likely good enough for most of us ) . Beyond the $ 400 saving , the D490 still retains a much smaller footprint ; it can easily slip into a pants or shirt pocket.As for the enhancement from 1.3 to 2.1 megapixels ( D460 vs D490 ) , I ca n't really tell much difference . I took two identical shots both & quot ; HQ & quot ; mode , printed them 4x6 on my HP970Cxi ; they look the same . Currently the D490 is about $ 100 more than the D460 . I would say the & quot ; burst & quot ; shooting alone is easily worth the extra money . Go and get one ! Shoot happy !	1
I got a whole set of these because the original one that my Palm came with was getting kind of boring . I like being able to change it whenever I like . The first couple of times , I had trouble getting the cover off , but once I got the hang of it , it was easy .	1
Let 's face it , these faceplates are frivolous ; however , they are fun , and now inexpensive too.PalmOne m100 Handheldare easy to remove and put in place , once you get the hang of it . Some colors are better than others , a quick review follows : Original Black -- use it in front of your boss . Or your Goth buddies.Silver is ok -- not bad but its nothing special either , cell phonish.Pacific Blue -- very nice , fine for the office too.Red -- all the red colors are fine , and tend to draw attention.Blue mist -- very attractive , not out of line for work either.Arctic White -- goes great with that iPod.Purple Passion -- Ghastly . Remarkably horrible.Burl Wood -- This one is a real success . Very , very attractive , and when used with thePalmOne m100 Series Slim Leather Carrying Caseit looks outstanding in any setting.There are other brands out there who make Palm faceplates too . They usually are n't quite as well made , but offer choices you ca n't find elsewhere . Two very nice colors available this way are Titanium Green and Dalmation ( not exactly a color but very cool , I put a photo of each in the `` photo sharing '' section . ) Both colors can be found on Palm 's web site .	1
I had one of the lighter blue covers while i was waiting for the Pacific Blue to be available in stores , but once i got the Pacific Blue , i 've had it permanently on my palm . The blue mist faceplate cover is just gathering dust.These faceplates are a cool and inexpensive way to make an m100 more interesting than the plain-black default .	1
The virtues of Palm organizers are well known to a lot of people , so I just want to say this . For this price , how would you not buy one ? This Palm has all the power and versatility of the Palm IIIxe -- my previous favorite -- PLUS the wireless capability ! You can e-mail anyone from anywhere and connect to internet services for ten bucks a month and that includes a lot of e-mail messages , but you can choose whether to subscribe or not . And you can have people reply automatically to another address so you do n't use up your allotted kilobytes . Just imagine carrying an internet connection in your pocket . Besides e-mail service you can log in to a lot of services through & quot ; web-clippings & quot ; , including amazon.com , weather , news , etc . And , of course , the more you use these services , the more you pay , but only if you go beyond your basic service rate . Again , for this price , who could ask for more in a Palm organizer ? It 's worth every penny you pay for it . Batteries ? Without a doubt , wireless services consume a lot of power , like cell phones , but 2 AAA batteries provide a reasonable performance . Even if you do n't need wireless service , I beg to disagree with other reviewers , this is already a great electronic organizer .	1
This purchase was easier than going to four local stores to find the exact size and color . I 'm satisfied with the quality of the product and speed of delivery .	1
I 've been left rather furious with some zip ties in the past that were brittle , these are quite sturdy and hold up well as long they stay above about 15F , below 15 they do start to become a bit brittle .	1
These are 11-inch , white , cable ties , a package of 100 . They are very strong and can be used to tie together a bundle of cables up to three inches thick . I got them to use in my office for holding excess cable lengths tidily in place to avoid massive tangling of the many different cables for my computer and peripherals . I am quite satisfied with these ties .	1
I use these for professional cable installs and they 're the kind of quality I was hoping for . I 'll be buying more .	1
these are great for tying whatever you have that need zip tying or keep things together . The size it great for the larger things .	1
These are very strong and easy to use . I used them to secure specialized tent stakes to tie down my large tent during high winds . They held perfectly . Very strong construction and well worth the price . Very useful for securing electrical cords and bundles of rope . These are now on my list of & # 34 ; Must Have & # 34 ; items for my tool box .	1
They 're long , they 're strong , and you ca n't go wrong . I use them outside to fasten panels to my front gate so that our dogs ca n't escape . They are constantly exposed to the Florida sun and weather as well as the movement of the gate as traffic goes in and out . I have found them to be durable under these conditions and very simple to replace when necessary . Good value for the money .	1
Gardner Bender has been supplying trade professionals for years . These are industrial duty ties that are rated for electrical use by journeymen . They are a bit more pricey than some of their really generic counterparts , but they also do the job they were designed to do , which many of the less expensive generic products do not .	1
Before buying this camera , think carefully about what you 'll be using it for , and when . I also recommend playing with one at a store , to feel its size and weight . ( Even if , like me , you 'll ultimately buy it at Amazon . ) I 've owned the VX-2000 for over a year now , and I 'm very happy with the results . Arguably , the picture quality is better than the Canon XL-1 ( and the vx2000 is significantly -- thankfully -- smaller ) , it 's rugged and reliable , and it 's somewhat portable . I carry mine in a backpack that has a padded pocket designed for laptop computers . It was the best solution as most smaller camera bags do n't fit this beast . Those that do are n't useful for toting other things as well.Anyway , I know a handful of other people with this camera . Some of them are *filmmakers* and these people use their VX-2000 's to document events that they 'd later like to make movies of . The filmmakers , as a whole , LOVE this camera . I also have a friend who does casting for television ads . Often , for his boss , he walks around with a VX2000 and shoots people on the street , later bringing the tape to the boss for evaluation.The other people I know own the VX-2000 because they *like electronics* . They *Like To Own The Best* and they like to play with gadgets . I advise , if you 're one of these people , and really , I KNOW YOU ARE , get a different camera . Something smaller ... granted the quality will be slightly less , but you 're more likely to have it when you witness your kid 's first words ( or your best friend 's wife in a rendevouz with a neighbor . you get the point ) Furthermore , this camera is somewhat lacking in toy features . No night vision , no silly effects ( save for a few wipes , swipes , fades , and sepia , etc . ) , no bluetooth transmitter , etc . It 's just good , strong , somewhat rugged , and takes a great shot.I give this camera a 5 for quality ( sharp , beautiful , accuracte colors , good in medium/low light , backlight compensation remarkable , optical steadyshot rad ) . Just keep in mind what you want ... this camera is neither professional nor amateur , and therefore I believe it serves best a select , picky subset of the population.Last , if you do buy it , go for ( 1 ) a bigger battery , well worth the cost , and ( 2 ) a wide angle lens . Both are cool .	1
I bought a larger version of this bag previously and I like the comfort of carrying in on my back . This bag I bought the Expedition 3 was used.However , it was in good shape . Nothing torn or missing . I would recommend this product .	1
This is a well made bag which can carry most all of your camera needs . I found it works well to carry on my camera on airplane trips . I can pack 3 lenses and a slr camera body . Room for accessories and a way to strap on a small tripod makes this a good bag for hiking.Well worth the cost for the value .	1
I purchased the Tamrac 5603 System 3 Camera Bag for my Canon T5i with battery grip and it works perfectly ! The camera bag is big enough to fit the camera with battery grip with an 18-135 lens ( or similar length lens ) installed , an additional lens , and small flash . The pockets on the front and inside of the top of the camera bag are perfect for additional batteries , memory cards , lens cloth , and even the lens hood for the 10-22 lens that I have ; the hood does fit in the front pocket . Overall , I am very happy with my purchase and recommend it if you have a similar camera/lens setup .	1
a place for everything and everything in its place describes this bag perfectly . if their is a flaw i did n't find one .	1
I was surprised how much stuff I can fit into this bag - 2 bodies , lenses , filters , memory cards , extra batteries and so on . Well organized and like all Tamrac bags ( which I 've used for many years ) , it 's sturdy and well-made .	1
Tamrac 's 5608 camera bag is well constructed , made of durable materials , and adaptable for various uses . It is heavily padded , with a stiff solid bottom , and is large enough to carry a couple of SLR camera bodies , even with battery grips attached , plus a fair amount of accessories.The interior of the bag can be divided into up to eight smaller compartments . Each camera body however , will take two spaces , so if you carry two bodies , there will be only four compartments remaining . The bag is bout 8 '' deep , and lenses , flash units , flash meters , battery packs , and the like , can be stored in these compartments . If you carry your SLR unassembled , you can carry quite a lot in this bag.If you want your camera ready to shoot with a lens attached , the dividers are designed so that a body with a zoom lens can be place down the middle of the bag . A camera with a telephoto lens up to around 10 inches will fit in the bag . If the lenses are about three inches each , two SLR 's with lenses attached can be accommodated in the down the middle configuration . Whenever a camera is carried this way , you may need to arrange your things carefully if you want to carry other gear.There is a zippered pocket with two compartments on the bottom of the bag 's cover flap , that is suitable for carrying things like filters , flash diffusers , memory card cases and the like . There is a zippered drop down compartment with pockets in the front . A pouch with velcro fasteners is on each side of the bag . The flap may not be likely to slip open , but carrying a valuable or heavy item in these pouches might not be a good idea . They are a decent size , and are good for items that are not too fragile . On the back of the bag is a shallow zippered pocket.The bag has a padded heavy duty carrying strap , and also has straps at the base for carrying a tripod . If you do n't use a memory card case , there is a wallet for carrying digital media , batteries , and other small accessories . The wallet is attached to the bag with an elastic band , and sides into a compartment on the side of the bag . The wallet is about six inches smaller than the compartment , resulting in more space to store items if you like.The design of this bag is excellent . Spaces are easy to access , gear is well protected , and there is capacity to conveniently carry a large amount of equipment . As with any camera bag , its ultimate usefulness depends on the user , and the particular gear to be carried . Getting hands-on access to different bags is not always possible , so study the photos and diagrams here , or at Tamrac 's website , and make a determination if this bag has enough space for your gear . The 5608 is available in either black or blue color . In general , camera bags are expensive , and prices are on the rise , so if you can afford to wait , try and get one on sale .	1
This bag is GREAT . I use it toghter with a tamrac backpack . But i prefere this one . It 's nice and big . and easy to adjust to your needs.I use this bag when i travel by plane as my handluggage . It fits my basic travel camera gear and some other stuff like a book and a bottle of water.The strap is good and does n't hurt .	1
Good price , excellent product , I have no complants at all.Tamrac is a great brand . This is not the first time that I have something made by them . I have always been pleased .	1
I need a big , but not too big bag so that I can have most of my things ( camera , lenses , flash etc . ) there and are still able to carry it around on my shoulder . I got the 5613 Ultra Pro first . That ' s a good , bigger bag . I can have almost all my things in there , but it is too big for me to carry it around as a shoulder bag . Then , I got 5608 . That 's way too small and the description is n't accurate for its size . This one , 5612 , is a good balance for me . It is not as big as some claim . Smaller than this one would be difficult to have a full-frame DSLR and a few lenses there . Even at the 5612 size , I can not have all my lenses there . With two cameras , it is inadequate . But , this is a compromise shoulder bag . I 'll keep it . The downside for improvement is organization of the compartments . With long or wide lenses , one has to reorganize the spaces because most are too small for lenses with hood on . If you switch lenses often and do n't want to take the hood on/off often , there is a good chance you wo n't like the way the compartments are divided . The two layers room arrangement is inconvenient but I 'm not certain there is a better alternative for a shoulder bag . Well , I may have to keep the 5613 as well because that one gives you much easier access of things quickly . But , it is just too big as a shoulder bag to carry around for long . Overall , 5612 is a good balance for a serious photographer , amateur or professional .	1
I got this bag because my old Tamrac 8 was just out of room and I have to say , this bag is pretty big and fits everything I want in it and more.Pro'sLarge size , many separate compartments , adjustable dividers inside , hard bottom and comfortable handleCon'sNo rain coverIf you have a lot in your bag or you have two bodies you need to carry this is the perfect bag for you , I have a lot in my bag , triggers , flashes , batteries , two bodies and 4-6 lens 's , remotes , chargers , cables and so much more . everything fits and I still have room to add more goodies.I did a youtube video on it as well , search for Tamrac 5612 Pro 12 Camera Bag and I am Techrunnr Wesley	1
I found the bag to be the perfect compromise between portability and storage space . It fits my D50 , 3 medium sized lenses and SB-600 flash in the main compartment . The camera is easily accessible by lifting the top flap , which can be closed either with a zipper ( for storage or transport ) or three clips ( useful while shooting , when you do n't want to mess with a zipper ) . The pocket in the inside of the top flap is perfect for holding filters , while the flip down side pocket provides convenient storage for memory cards . I agree with a previous reviewer regarding the side pockets , which have non-ideal velcro closures that make me wary of placing anything breakable in them for fear that they will fall out . However , the pockets are still useful for storing lens caps , a blower brush , etc . The strap is very comfortable , and I 've found it easy to carry the bag on my hip for long periods of time.All-in-all , I 'm impressed at the amount of thought that went into this bag . Highly recommended .	1
The Tamrac System 6 is the Amateur DSLR User 's Dream shoulder bag . It is rugged , attractive , and best of all wo n't break the bank . I 'm fond of blue , so the blue accent on black background really pleases . This case is very accomodating ; it carries my Pentax DSLR with lens mounted plus 2-3 extra lenses and a large hot shoe flash unit along with cords , users guides , and cleaning brush .	1
... master of none.PRO : *holds over a thousand tracks . *sounds great . *versatile output : headphones , small speakers , auxiliary jack on stereo , pc . *power adapter -- charges batteries too . *fairly portable . *simple operation when connected to pc . *bells and whistles with eq presets , recording , stuff I 've never had the patience or knowledge to use well . *you can add to the current play queue from the library without interrupting the music . *it does n't skip , really . *the ability to save playlists and edit them on the fly , to reduce a thousand tracks worth of cds to the small size are really worth whatever you choose to spend on the privilege.CON : *not `` All your music , wherever you go , '' as billed-but plenty of music anywhere you 'd care to carry it . ( There are far larger hard drives for sale since I got mine almost 2 years ago ) . *it 's as bulky as a portable cd player and heavier than most . *the battery power runs out too quickly . *the user interface is lacking-you can get there from here , but you 're going to be hunched over your magic jukebox for a few minutes while you wait on slow refresh rates and clumsy controls . ( Although it is feature-rich , it is clearly an early attempt at bringing the power of the technology into the hands of the average user . ) *it 's almost as noisy as my laptop . *the IR port on the front of it is smoke and mirrors , a yet unfulfilled indication of future functionality . *you ca n't create a playlist on the pc and drag it to the jukebox without re-uploading those tracks to the device . *this particular model came with nothing I cared to have in the way of pre-installed music and an unattractive , inconvenient carrying case , an extra set of rechargeable batteries-and cost significantly more than the no-frills `` C '' model of the jukebox that came out about six months later.Though it 's not everything I 'd hoped it would be , and though the user interface is really annoying , it does make life very convenient and it sounds greatNote : I have actually considered buying a newer rev of this with more disk space and a dial to facilitate scrolling through lists . They are available now with tons of space and are viable replacements for a shelf full of cds in your living space -- if the functionality has improved alongwith the disk size .	1
After using a zoom lens with macro feature built in a decided to make the jump to a dedicated macro lens and I 'm really glad I did . Canon does n't disappoint with this one . Lens takes nice sharp photos and was easy to get used to . You ca n't go wrong with Canon !	1
I use this lens all the time , and never get bored of finding things to photograph with it . It is really a good lens and you will often see people comment on the fact that it may be one of those special lens ' that could be L glass but gets away with being reasonably priced.Build : This is a solid well built lens . Its mostly metal construction ensures that it will last a long time . The focus ring is of course rubber and is easy to use . However this lens is heavy , so much so that if you are handholding it and using manual focus your camera holding hand will get tired . I have attempted to do this with a 430EX flash mounted on top and it is literally hand cramping after a while . You will most likely want to purchase a tripod collar with this lens , as a lot of focus will be lost due to camera shake.AF : This lens is n't the fastest lens on earth , and in conjunction with an XTi I find that it is sometimes annoyingly slow . It also tends to hunt a little in all but the best light conditions . Another reason to get a lens collar and use a tripod . However I rarely use autofocus with macro work , and prefer the control of manual . Given the shallow depths of field , manual is much more useful . Also the only time you really need a fast AF with macro is outside shooting bugs and such , and you will probably have the light of the sun which would of course be plenty to ensure the AF functions as you want it to . I wouldnt pass this lens up on account of the slightly slow AF.Picture Quality : I find that this lens produces incredibly sharp pictures ( again , do not expect really sharp pictures hand held , I feel like a lot of people complain about this , but dont realize its their fault , not the lens ' ) . The saturation and general color is amazing , and I rarely find that I have to up the saturation or vibrance . Personally I have found this lens to be tack sharp at f/4 , and it stays there most of the time , as f/2.8 is a very very shallow depth of field.In Comparison : Although I do not own the 60mm macro , I have had a chance to use one , and although the 60mm is more versatile ( i.e portraits ) , I would not give up the reach . Even at 100mm I find myself wishing I had the 180mm L lens . But 100mm is certainly better than 60mm . This is definitely a macro lens , if you also want to do portraits get the 100mm and the 50 1.8 . Personally this is a better choice than loosing the 40mm.Overall : amazing lens , you will be satisfied if you are looking to do macro and some portraits if you have enough room ( outside ) . The only reason I give it four and not five stars is the slow AF in darker lighting situations . But you can work around this . Great lens from a great company !	1
I have a bag full of lenses and this is easily my favorite ( I 'm sure I would think differently if I could afford the Canon EF 180mm f/3.5 macro . ) I 've really gained an appreciation for macro photography since buying this lens . There 's a whole world of creative possibilties located right inside YOUR house ! For the technical ... This is a true macro lens . Many lenses like to claim they are `` macro '' , or have a `` macro mode '' but if the lens does not do 1:1 magnification , its not true macro . This is the case with Canon 's 50mm `` macro '' , which requires you to purchase an additional adapter for nearly $ 300 . You 'd have saved money by just buying this lens in the first place .	1
Hey listen , we oughta give this lens a reward or something ... .I used to use a Minolta X-700 to which I would thread onto my 50mm lens either one , two , or all three of my `` close up '' lenses to get semi-decent shots of bees , flowers , ants , etc. , etc. , but for the hassle I 'd have to go through compared to this lens , it was just plain inconvenient . I 've had this lens for about four hours now . I 'm in awe of how SHARP the images are with this lens , whether it 's manually or auto-focused . And then , just swing it up from the close-up target , and you 've got a great portrait lens . I had some qualms about spending almost $ 500.00 for a lens of this type , 25 times what I spent for the close-ups for the Minolta , but of course , that 's an apples and oranges thing . The build quality of this lens is absolutely top notch . The attention paid to detail in every facet of this tool , whether outside or in , is full gratification of the dollars spent for it ; all first quality wherever you look . If you 're looking for a great lens for macro work with a lot of versatility , this is the one to buy . I ca n't wait for summer to get here to utilize its inherent superior attributes . Now , what 'd I just say ? It 'll be a lot of fun to do stuff with ! Thanks . Mmn .	1
I really love this lens . I mostly use manual focus , a tripod and RS-80N shutter release when setting up my shots . My mistake was buying an off-brand macro ring light that eats batteries so I am saving to get the Canon MT-24EX which costs more than the lens . This lens does not need much light to get great shots but the effects of macro lighting makes for those colorful vibrant macro pics you see in National Geographic . I have several L lenses and the 100mm Macro is every bit as sharp as those lenses .	1
Had this lens for a number of months - really great . This is not a heavy neck breaker . It is super fast to focus and the sharpest of all my Canon 's - even better then the 85mm L. Have done some shockingly good flower work and also been amused by what you can get with insects that I had never seen before . Highly recommended and I consider cheap for the quality and flexibility .	1
I am an advanced amateur . I bought this Canon lens to round out my array of lenses for my Rebel XSi . I was interested in taking macro shots of bugs and other small objects , plus have the capability of a portrait lens . I have n't had it for very long and I have n't taken a lot of pictures yet , but it is impressive in its sharpness and accurate focusing . It focuses to .9 foot but you have to have a steady hand since it does n't have IS . Construction is solid ( notice the weight ) and all focusing is internal , so the barrel does n't move in and out . This is a great feature for macro images.I recommend it highly but if I had the extra money I would go for the Canon 100mm macro lens with IS . That is the only reason I gave it a 4.0 rating .	1
The 100 f/2.8 macro is very sharp , even for general shooting , so it works great for portraits , too . When I 'm not using a zoom , this is my walkaround lens for people , relatively tight scenes and even indoor sports . Think of it as a great lens that also shoots macro than the other way around . Hard to beat that versatility at the price.But it comes into its own at close distances . If you 've never had a macro lens , you 'll run around shooting everything in sight because everything looks new from a macro perspective.Canon has several macro lenses . I prefer the 100 mm over shorter lenses because I do n't have to get quite as close to that bee or wasp . The 180 mm gives you even more distance from your subject , more background blur and amazing sharpness . But it 's much more expensive and in most cases you 'll need a tripod , and I shoot a lot of improptu macros as I 'm hiking.For extreme closeups with larger-than-life images , there 's the MP-E 65 . It goes up to 5X , compared to the 100mm 's 1X , but you lose autofocus with this lens . In fact , you set your magnification and then move the camera until the object is in focus ! As you get beyond about 2X , the viewfinder gets fairly dark . If you 're doing still life macro work , it 's amazing . I 'll probably get one someday for shooting my mineral colletion.One thing to keep in mind with any macro is that because of the close distances , you 're often in lower light conditions . Althought it 's fairly pricey , I 'm using the MT-24 EX , which lets you adjust the direction of the twin flashes . The MR-14EX ring light is a couple hundred dollars cheaper but will produce a slightly flatter image . And you can always use one of the standard flashes , though the closeness of your subject may cause some odd shadows .	1
A super lens even for a mediocre amateur like myself.The only downside is that it 's heavy one causing a bit of balance problems but overall well worth the expense .	1
I have taken many macro photos over the years , but this is my first quality macro lens and now I know what I have been missing all these years . This lens is a must have for clear macro photography and with the felxibility of the 100mm range , one can take great photos without distubring the subject in cases of photographing incects or other small living creaturs .	1
... but it 'll work for portraits . It 's as sharp as the more expensive a 24-70L lens and its color rendition is nearly as good . I 've loaned it to budding photographers who have used kit lenses only and they ca n't believe the image quality . Some of my best photos have come from this lens .	1
This is a great lens . The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish I would have purchased it with image stabilization . Being so long & heavy , there is quite a bit of camera shake when handheld . But , if you do n't have the extra $ 500 to spend then it 's a great piece of equipment . There should be no issues with using it on a tripod .	1
If you 've only worked with zoom lenses , you may be pleasantly surprised by the sharpness of a prime lens like this one . I only dabble in macro photography but also wanted a good outdoor portrait lens and this fits the bill perfectly ! It 's fast , has lovely bokeh and is sharp all the way to the corners . The 100mm length gives you a bit more distance when shooting insects which is a good plus , but be aware that this is a fairly heavy lens and not easily handheld ( and does not have IS as many of the zooms these day do . ) Use of a tripod is certainly recommended when possible as for good macro shots you do often need to stop down and may have to sacrifice a bit on shutter speed as a result . This may not be marked as an L lens , but it certainly is that level of quality . My only real gripe is that Canon does not include the accessories ( hood , case ) with the lens , as is typical for lenses in this price range . Otherwise , an excellent lens for anyone wanting to try their hand at true 1:1 macro photography .	1
Bought this about 60 days ago and it 's been my primary lens since . This is by far the sharpest lens we have and with the biggest aperture . Just yesterday was at our daughter 's dance rehearsal and no flashes were allowed . I tried to use the 28-135 telephoto that came with the camera but it 's was just way too dark . Moved back a few rows and slapped on this baby and everything became so much brighter and I got some really good action shots at 1600 ISO . By the way , the Canon 40D is so good that 1600 ISO shots are useable.As to the macro function , it 's great . For small insects you will need a monopod , a steady hand , and manual focus .	1
If I were to take a picture with this lens and then an identical picture with the & # 34 ; L & # 34 ; version of this lens and you were able to tell me what the difference is , I would seriously give you $ 100 . Good luck . This lens is unbelievably sharp . It 's like looking through a microscope . You may want to consider a set of Kenko extention tubes once you buy this , though . You 'll just want to get closer and closer once you experiment with this lens.Side note , do n't forget about this lens ' wonderful ability to take portrait shots . Fantastic lens !	1
I have had this lens for 3 years now , so I am a little late posting a review , but as I am considering picking up another one , given the current discount , it might be a good time : There is really nothing wrong with this one , it has superb optics , very fast and accurate auto-focus ( especially for a macro ) , nice bokeh ( not quite as good as the 135mm 2.0 L , but close ) and 100mm is a very versatile focus length on a FF body . Considering performance , decent build quality , and price , I 'd consider it the best value of any Canon lens out there . It 's not an L lens and the 100mm L Macro version is more rugged , weather-sealed , and offers IS . However , rest assured that optical performance is on the same level and if you ca n't take good macro shots with this one , then the L version will not do you much good either . Also , IS is not very effective at a macro level . I take a lot of shots of bugs in flight , which works best handheld with auto-focus , and this lens provides impressive results . But keep in mind that this is a challenging area of photography and expecting every shot to yield a perfect picture , is setting yourself up for disappointment .	1
This is the lens I leave on my camera for general purpose use . At non-macro focus distances , it is a very fast lens in a convenient short-telephoto length . The images are sharp out to the corners . This is one of those great Canon lenses that probably deserves an L-series rating but is available without the red stripe and exorbitant cost.Tested in an astrophotography context ( point sources on black backgrounds - excellent for revealing aberration and coma ) , I have found that this lens is reasonably sharp at f/4 and completely sharp by f/5.6 . For daylight terrestrial photography , the tiny aberrations caused by the wide-open f/2.8 aperture are hardy noticeable and by f/4 the images are exquisitely sharp.There is a lot of glass in this lens - it is heavy . I highly recommend buying the tripod collar as it allows you to attach the camera and lens to a tripod or ballhead with much better balance.Also , if you plan on using the macro functionality , keep in mind that the effective f-stop of the lens goes way up when you 're focusing at very close range . At 15cm from the front surface , it performs as though it were an f/9 . You 'll either want a lot of light or a very steady subject and a good tripod ( another reason to buy the hideously overpriced tripod collar ) .	1
I would recommend looking at professional reviewers with equipment designed to measure lenses if you are interested in macro lenses . However , as a user of this lens , I would simply say , it 's sharp , it 's fast , and it 's a good lens .	1
The Canon EF 100-300 f/4.5-5.6 USM is the best entry level 300mm zoom lens . In order to do any better you have to get into Canon 's L line which means a lot more money . Many people , including myself , start off with Canon 's EF 75-300 f/4-5.6 III USM because of the low price . This lens wo n't break the bank but is definitely worth the difference . The build quality is much better on the 100-300 . Also I have found this lens to be sharper . Along with that , this one has ring-type USM instead of micro USM so it focuses faster and quieter while allowing full time manual focus -- you can manually adjust the focus without having to switch between AF and MF . Also , since it uses internal focusing , the front of the lens does n't rotate or extend when focusing so it is easier to use a circular polarizer . For the money , you ca n't beat this lens .	1
I honestly felt compelled to write this after reading many of the other reviews . It seems that everyone out there rating the product high has & quot ; just got it this morning & quot ; and everyone else seems to be complaining about repairs and such.Well , my case is different . I bought my Nomad II MG a little over a year ago along with a friend of mine . We got them at the same time , from the same store and with an extra 64MB ( total 128MB ) .I use the unit every day while going to and from the office ( at least 2 hours a day ) . In my experience , the battery will not last more than 5-6 hours ( they say 8 ) . Having said that , I have not had to replace the battery.Let me get the bad out of the way first ... - The buttons are extremely sensitive . After a while , I wound up locking up the unit and just let it run on random.- Random logic seems & quot ; not so random & quot ; .- Controls are not intuitive and take some getting used to.- SmartMedia card will sometimes stop working . Shutdown , remove and replace usually solves this.- The headphones are horrible ! Extremely uncomfortable ! I wound up buying Sony Phonotopia.- There was a shutdown problem while docked which was solved when I upgraded firmware.If after reading the previous list you think I hate this unit , think again ... I love it ! This unit is extremely light , small and portable . You can carry it in a shirt pocket . Easy to carry in any season.If you get the 128MB total , you have an average 2 hours of music to go along with you . Got tired of the same music ? Switch to the FM tuner and you 're good to go . ( or switch to 96kbps sampling rate and cram more songs in ) This unit has great sound . I also found it to be loud enough for my taste . I always use sound level at 30 ( 50 max ) .For the record , the sync software is very easy to use ... My friend has had the same experience with this MP3 player as I have . We 're both very happy with it and I would buy it again in a heartbeat .	1
The wattage may be weak but these speakers pack a punch ! Turn the bass up in Windows Media Player SRS WOW effects , crank the bass knob on the speakers all the way up and you have clear , undistorted kick butt bass ! Drums come in clear , synths perfect sounding and kickin ' bass ! I 've had these speakers for 3 years now and not a single complaint other than the fact they dont have a headphone jack up top for night time listening .	1
I 'm not sure when I bought these , 2000 or 2001 , something like that . And here it is 2010 , and these Altec Lansings are still going strong . Admittedly they are now in the basement and do n't get as much use as they did in the old days , and the contacts for one of the speakers is getting flakey , but they still sound good and were a overall a great bargain . I hope they last another 10 years !	1
This camera takes some really great pictures and videos BUT , if you are n't a computer whiz , you better know someone that is to download the .avi video files because neither the owners manual nor the software users guide mention ANYTHING relative to getting the .avi videos on your hard drive to save them.Installation of the camera and viewer software is a breeze but after that , your on your own to figure out saving videos.Something that is not mentioned in advertising is that theres a warning in the owners manual about using it in the desert ( which is where I live , LOL ) . Oh well we shall see .	1
As far as picture quality and ease of use go the Fuji FinePix 4900 is by far one of the best digital cameras you can buy . Fuji probably discontinued this model though because the battery only lasts about 45 minutes to an hour if used with the LCD ( Liquid Crystal Display ) . If you use the EVF ( Electronic View Finder ) the battery will last longer , the LCD just looks cooler is all . The software that comes with this camera is also very user-friendly and appears to be compatible with all OS 's . Overall an excellent digital camera ! ! ! ! Extra batteries can be bought through the following web site . -- > [ ... ]	1
I 've been using the Finepix 4900 for several months right now and I love the camera 's features . I think the one big negative point about this model is the poor battery life . If you use the flash and the LCD display , expect about 40 shots before you get the low battery indicator . I would recommend purchasing a second battery and charger for long trips.The LCD viewfinder is another problem . The image you get from using the viewfinder is n't very clear in low light situations . My previous digital camera was the Fuji MX-2900 which had an optical viewfinder . If you get a chance to compare an LCD viewfinder to an optical one-you would agree that the optical works better . This also puts another strain on the battery life issue too.Enough on the negatives . The best part about this camera is the image quality . It 's excellent and I love the 6X optical zoom . I would avoid using the digital zoom whenever possible . The lens on this model was the main reason for purchasing this camera .	1
Monster is known for good quality cables but also for being pretty expensive , so I was suprised to see that these cables were only running $ 20 for 12 ft. and $ 25 for 21 ft.I did n't bother looking at them at Guitar Center as I just thought , I 'm sure they 're nice but I wo n't even bother looking at the price . The sales rep recommended them when I asked about some quality cables and told me about their lifetime guarantee . I 'm tired of cables going on the fuzz and having to buy new ones only 2-3 yrs . after purchase so after seeing the price , I went for it.End result , they work perfectly . I was having some buzz and noise from my older cables but that 's all gone now . The Monster cable sounds clean and clear . No more background interference.If you 'll notice from the picture , Monster wisely chose to cover the bottom of the plug with a nice rubber cover . No more of those metal covers that unscrew , allowing dirt and dust to get in there . Those things caused alot of trouble for me over the years and I 'm glad to not have to mess around with them anymore . The blue stripe is one of a few different color bands , which are included , that you can use to color code your cables with . So you can color each one for each purpose . Good feature.I like this cable and it 's good to know that it 'll be replaced for free forever under normal use and wear and tear . I 've stayed away from Monster for home theater as their audio/video cables are outrageously over priced . But for playing guitar , I think I have my new brand . Recommended .	1
The most valuable money expend in hi fi . It is way worth it to spend 15 bucks and listen the diference . Trust , try & go !	1
Monster Cable has always made nice speaker wire and unless you are an audiophile , you will never need anything more than this product . I got this spool for a job I 'm doing replacing some older wire . I got a lot more than I actually need , but if you are like me I hate having to wait to do a project so I got extra ( future projects ) . 500ft / $ 46 seems fair for the quality and next time I can just go grab the spool and do a job when I feel inspired.The wire is flat , but like some other reviews pointed out it is much more fat than your typical audio wire . This wire will hide very well along a door sill or at the bottom of white molding . If you match this product up with Banana plugs you are good to go ... ... ... ... the sound quality is very good . If you are looking for something that will last and is better than the stuff you get at the hardware store this is perfect .	1
This is nice speaker wire , however it is thick ( flat and wide ) and much thicker and heavier than the speaker wire I am used to , and for me , it was oddly shaped . The wire itself has the consistency more like hair than wire making it hard to push through the holes in the speakers . It works nicely and it 's a great price for the amount of wire you get . I must not have read something correctly because I was really surprised at the sheer bulk of the wire itself .	1
I was one of those skeptics who felt that those oversized cables was a rip-off . A friend of mine invited me over for a `` listen '' , boy did I change my mind . When he upgraded his monster m series bywire cables , he gave them to me . I purchased the banana lock modular plugs from Amazon , conected them to my Yamaha , But hurricane Irene took out my electricity . My power was restored on 9/1/11 , the first thing I did was fired up my sound , I was blown away not by Irene , but by the audio quality that I heard from the same equipment I have always owned . I am now an advocate of high quality cables . I owe all this to AMAZON > COM	1
Works great . Hooked it up to my Yamaha receiver 's B speaker output and I now have now music in the house and patio . Doesnt shut down the receiver like my previous speaker switch .	1
I know a couple of people who have this speaker selector . It works well ! Very simple installation and audio coming out of it sounds good !	1
I got this for distributing sound to my home audio speakers . Works like a charm and have n't had an issues .	1
I picked this up when i ordered a NAD integrated amp with only one set of speaker outputs . I currently have 2 pairs running but plan on another pair for the master bath and I 'll be set since this Monster set can run 4 pairs.The unit came pretty fast , and upon inspection I could see that it was built to a lower price point than what is typical for Monster , but that 's not a bad thing as much of their gear can be quite pricey . The speaker inputs on back are not designed for anything bigger than 14 gauge , and the manual suggests using gold pin connectors on wire larger than that . Currently you can get a set of 4 pairs of Monster Gold Angled Pin connectors for 7 bucks on Amazon , but do n't get banana plugs , they do n't fit . I started by making sure my amp was indeed off . Never make ANY connections with your gear on , it can damage sensitive circuits . Upon inserting my 14 gauge wire , I found it a tight fit , but by twisting or rotating the wire as I pushed it in , it was fine with no loose strands . Loose strands can cause a short if long enough , clip any you see , and take your time on this , you are not in a race , and doing it carefully will give you years of service.Monster could have used bigger or better speaker connectors here , small spring clips are not exactly the best . But it 's a small unit and to accommodate big 5 way binding posts would have required a much bigger back plate which would mean a much bigger case all around . More expensive to build , so I 'm fine with the size and the price , some may not be.So after making all the connections , I tested it out and have been very happy with the sound . It has circuitry that a ) connects multiple pairs of speakers to your amp in parallel and b ) adds some form of resistance to each channel to maintain 8 ohms for your amp as 2 ohms would be dangerous for most amps or receivers . I wondered if this Monster model would change or color the sound when it added load but the sound remained untouched , albeit with slightly less volume easily compensated for . For running a single pair , you disengage the circuitry by pushing a button , and 2 or more pairs requires you to depress said button to engage this circuitry . Pretty easy way to protect your gear , I 've been just leaving the protection circuitry on as there are no issues this way.For the money , this model is an excellent option to run speakers in different rooms or zones .	1
Purchased the Monster Cable SS-6 Speaker Switcher to turn off and on my different speakers . It does a good job and allows you to turn speakers off in one area of the home and on in another . If you have thicker gauge speaker wire you will need some type of adapter on the ends of the wire . There are simple spring clips on the back of the unit that can accommodate normal speaker wire . The unit is not powered so do n't expect it to provide a boost to your speakers . It is a good basic speaker switcher .	1
I used this to add additional zones to my back yard , basement and swimming pool area . Very happy with the performance and does not kill the sound at all to the speakers even of I have all zones on . Works Great ! !	1
.This is a sharp looking PDA . Looks-wise it blows the doors off the Palm IIIex that I use . It does n't have the flip lid that I love on my palm , but it is a jewel and perfect for a woman with a purse . The case is reasly sharp looking and very classy . It is thicker than the Palm , which is a valid trade-off given the expansion slots -- I see myself buying one or two of these in the future.You may want to get the flip open leather case which makes it about perfect . Included with the Platinum , is a slide in leather case , which was OK , but I thought it was a slow process to pull the Platinum out to use . The flip open case is fast and more proffessional looking.I found the Platinum to be noticably faster than my Palm . Admittedly my Palm seemed to have slow down with some of the software I added to it , but my overall impression is that the Platinum is faster than my Palm ever was.The software included on the Handspring is better than what you find on the Palm . If I could , I would delete some of the software built into my Palm 3xe -- but it 's built into the firmware -- you ca n't get rid of it . For example : the calculator . On the Platinum , the calculator software is pretty good -- It is the same software I loaded on my Palm to replace the calculator built in . The difference is I had to load mine into memory , and had to keep the other calculator because it was built into the firmware -- a waste of space . That really bugged me.The only down side on the Handspring Platinum , is the extra cost of a serial connection . The USB port is faster , but unless you have a computer that has one of these ports , you may find it difficult or impoosible to back it up.It seems clear to be that unless the folks at Palm get moving , Handspring will leave them in the dust . Handspring 's products are better designed , more flexible and about 2 years ahead of the current Palm products.If you buy a Platinum you wo n't regret it . Be sure to get a serial cable if your desktop PC does not have a USB port.Conrad Senior	1
Utilizing the same software as a Palm PDA , the Handspring provides everything you need and costs less . It has the same user interface . It looks the same . The main difference is that the Handspring costs about half what a comparable Palm Organizer would run . The batteries , 2 AAA , last between 2 and 3 months depending on usage . And , the handset comes with a USB compatible cradle which will dock to any Macintosh ( G3/Blue and newer ) and many PCs . This is a great alternative to overpaying for a Palm . Plus , Handspring has several plug-ins that help to expand the power even more.This latest version , the Visor Platinum , runs at a faster speed than the Visor Deluxe . Of course , this really is only important for power users . The rest of us will just look at it as a nifty new color .	1
This was my first Palm . So I was a little apprehensive about it . However , I have been completely bought over . It is a great device and works wonderfully well . However , I did not like the desktop software that came with it . Instead , I downloaded Handspring 's 4.x Desktop software . That is even better , because it allows me to sync my palm using Infra red on my laptop . The screen is bright and one does not need to squint to read . And battery life is marvelous . Despite my heavy usage , it takes me through the week.The only drawback is that it is bulky and a little heavier than other color palms in the market.I had Graffiti problems in the beginning , but after downloading the patches from Handspring 's website , the problem disappeared . I recommend that users should regularly visit Handspring 's website for such patches and updates .	1
Decent battery life , easy to read ( except in direct sunlight ) and a fast USB hot sync . What more could you ask for ? Well if I were asking I would like a speaker that was a bit louder and an 8MB flash backup capability . I love the springboard slot , my two favorites , the OMNIRemote ( control anyone 's TV ! ) and the InnoVision 2/V 2MB flash backup + vibrating alert.The color capability lets me put all of my wallet & quot ; snapshots & quot ; into my hand now . This is possible with the number of colors you can display at once ( not so on the Palm III/c ) and I can easily download maps into the unit for later retrieval when I 'm lost.I also insist on rechargable batteries ( I hate replacing batteries ) but I did manage to run out of juice when I had several alerts and did n't recharge for 3 weeks.Love the calculator ( its actually useful vis a vis the Palm standard one ) and DateBook+ is an improvement as well . Every traveller should have one .	1
I love my Prism and use it constantly . It 's great for games and reading on the road . It does have some minor problems , though.1 ) In direct sunlight , the screen appears black , making it difficult/impossible to use.2 ) The darned thing is bulky as all getout.3 ) It does n't work with any other Handspring products , except the styli and the cartridges ... so you 've got to have special cradles , chargers , cases , etc . And you ca n't use keyboards.4 ) Poor battery life . Do n't plan on using this thing all the way through a trip . Buy a car charger.5 ) Customer support is AWFUL ! ! ! I seriously think they were trying to scam me out of some money . They actually did get some out of me so that I could replace one IMMEDIATELY so that I could get something approaching a real battery life . Otherwise I 'd have been PDAless for several weeks .	1
The Visor Prism may be the best color Palm OS PDA out there at the moment . The 16 bit color display is a joy to use compared to the 8 bit display on the Palm IIIc , and there can be no comparison to the non-color displays.The processor is fairly speedy , but nothing to write home about . The built in battery holds it 's charge fairly well , but do n't plan on using the device constantly during long flights on it.The only drawbacks to this model are minor . The Prism is a fairly bulky device , as thick or thicker than the Palm VII , which may make finding a case for it difficult . It 's always a little hard to find a good carrying case for a Visor because the removable expansion port cover makes it hard to affix the velcro pad for securing the device in the case . Finally , the side mounted IR port is a bit of pain to use , especially with Palm users . But really , how often do you beam stuff anyway ? Summary : Excellent display , good flexibility due to the expansion slot . Good value .	1
Now that I have had my Prism for a month , I think it has been run through enough use to have a valid review . When making the initial purchase , I had compared all the PDA options , including PocketPC . I still would pick the Prism over the alternatives.USB is used instead of serial port . It is faster and much easier to set up ( basically no setup ) . This is also good because my serial port is already dedicated to my GPS unit , so I did not want to add a switchbox or keep swapping devices.The color is nice . The display is much better than other color displays on the market . The 16-bit color is noticeably better than 8-bit color . I use SplashPhoto to display family pictures and they look very nice . Once you use a ( good ) color PDA , you wo n't want to go back.The expansion module will be nice . There are n't as many modules available as I thought , but I plan on getting the next version of wireless modem or phone when it comes out.The physical size is bigger than the latest ones , but I prefer the better color and rechargeable batteries . It fits comfortably in my hand and is not cumbersome , but is not as eye-catching as the thin ones.Of the 8M , I am currently using just over half . My important additional applications are Avantgo ( currently at 650K , but can be changed ) , Bejeweled ( 71K ) , BigClock ( 68K ) , ChessGenius ( 78K ) , AppForge Booster ( 340K ) , MyBible-NIV ( 1650K ) , SplashPhoto ( 466K , depends on number of photos , about 50K per full-screen photo ) .I love this unit and have not had any problems with it . I use it frequently during my work day and it rarely uses more than 20 % of its charge . It only takes minutes to recharge once I get home .	1
After owning the Visor Platinum for several months , I finally upgraded to the Visor Prism . The Visor Prism has advantages over all other Handspring Visors in which it has the very nice color screen and built in Lithium Ion rechargeable batteries.The disadvantage to this unit is the flickering back light on the screen . Once or twice every minute or so , the backlight will flicker . The flicker may bother some of you ( or most of you ) . This is the major reason why I ca n't give this unit 5 stars ... The other disadvantage ( not major ) is the thickness of the unit . It is several millimeters thicker in some areas , and the springport slot is a little farther back than the Deluxe or Platinum , in which the Visorphone may be uncomfortable to use . The Visorphone is held near the ear , and the Visorphone is set back a little , so the top edge of the Visorphone will first come into contact with your ear ( may be bothersome , as Handspring enclosed these adhesive spacers for comfort when placing near ear ) .You have to use the cradle specific to the Prism , as it is a bit more expensive to purchase a second one.The advantages totally outweigh the disadvantages , as a reason I still bought the unit .	1
I spent about three weeks relentlessly researching which handheld device I would use to supplement my two desktop systems that I keep in either residence.Because of operating system stability issues ( Windows CE ) I decided against the more appealing Compaq Ipaq . I like simple , hard working devices and the Palm OS is almost Zen like in it 's simplicity and usability ( read : reliable ) .For the last year I have been using a Motorola P935 pager and in doing so , convinced myself that I could do without a full size laptop becuase I needed extreme portability , but I was missing functionality ( wireless web/email access ) . It sends email , but only up to 500 characters and sometimes that is not enough.I use this device extensively both on the job and off . While travelling from Texas to the East Coast I work 80-100 hours a week , run a small online business , manage my investments and keep track of an enormous amount of personal information.Coupled with the Omnisky Minstrel Wireless Modem the Handspring Prism is a true champion for power packed portability . I find the coverage in Houston and the Boston/Providence/Narraganset area to be more than adequate.The TO DO list is great and the repeatable function is great for reminders such as filling out time sheets with straight time during the week and time + 1/2/double time on the weekends . It also interfaces with the calendar so that you can view your open items along with scheduled times.I do not synchronize very often , but when I do it seems to work well.I use a 8mb backup module all of the time because I have had a lockup that caused me to lose all of my data , but this was once and it was for a very avoidable mistake : I was synchronizing with Omnisky over the wireless connection to update my software and lost the connection , corrupting the files . After the backup , I accomplished this same task several times but under controlled conditions ( not moving around ) .There are a lot of great games for the Prism and the color looks great . I do n't play many games , but I do enjoy Sim City.The graffitti text entry is ok , I 've picked it up , but I will be soon adding the & quot ; Halfkeyboard & quot ; after reading the reviews about the folding Targus model . Again , this decision was for portability.One bad thing : The battery does run down fast . I have to charge it every day , and sometimes more than that with heavy use . I have a easy travel charger , so it is not a big deal and it does charge fast.I am able to take this device in the field , jot down information and action items and keep everything organized . Later , I can work with this information anywhere without the awkwardness of a laptop.I am sold on the Palm OS , and I am very happy I chose the Handspring Prism because of the bright color display . It is a great device that is reliable and very powerful.I recently purchased the Blazer HTML browser , which is a very nice browser . I can access most sites , including my online resume . I was able to make changes and save it with no problems.I also spent a few days in the hospital recently ( birth of 3rd child ) and was pleased to find a strong signal in the room we were in . I probably spent 8-10 hours a day trying different web sites with no problems at all.No problems until my wife discovered what I was doing and decided it was tantamount to neglecting her ...	1
I have wanted a digital camera ever since buying my mom a Largan Chameleon Digital Camera earlier this year . I paid $ 100 , which was a good price at that time . The Jam Cam produces nearly as good a photo as the Chameleon for what amount to the cost of buying and developing three conventional rolls of film.It is extremely easy to learn to use this camera . There are two buttons on the back that control all the functions . It is very easy to read the little symbols that are displayed on the back . The camera itself feels sturdier than most cheap digital cameras , thanks to rubbery black grips on each side . It goes very nicely with the world 's most popular color du jour , silver , that comprises the body.It comes with both serial and USB cables . Use the USB for very fast downloads . The software that you download into is very easy to use and performs most basic corrections without having to use the included Adobe photo software . I ca n't comment on that product because I use Photosuite IV for more advanced editing , but as I said , you can do most stuff right in the download mode.It uses a plain old 9 volt battery , which is great . It does n't come with one though , so make sure you have one on hand . I plan to use a rechargable one to avoid replacing them . The battery life seems good . One thing I 've noticed is that when it shows as half used , leaving it plugged in to the USB for a few minutes , it goes back to full . A fluke , or does the USB carry a charge ? I 'm not a techie so who knows . I 've taken over 100 photos so far and the battery is still showing full , with the occaisional half full.Another review correctly said that the flash washes out indoor closeups . A sheet of toilet paper over the flash corrects that problem . An old trick . Personally , I 'm grateful for the strong flash , the Largan is a bit weak in that area.With any inexpensive digital camera , you are going to have to learn how to play with it in order to work around it 's shortcomings . This camera does best in good lighting , either indoors or out . You can get some graininess in some outdoor shots in the shade . Foilage can come out as a green monolith rather than branchy , for instance . The next shot can come out perfectly with just a little change in lighting or angle . The Largan does better in this regard.I 've already captured some really nice photos of my dogs and house with this camera . Using the self-timer , I even got a good photo of myself , which is quite an accomplishment . I usually look like a bloated third world dictator in my photos , so I was surprised to actually get a good photo of myself in the first attempt.An optional memory card expands the capacity of the Jam Cam from the rather paltry 8 it carries without it . I am getting along nicely without it because I do a lot of stuff around the home where I can shoot and download instantly . ( That 's one of the nice things about a digital camera , the Polaroid-like ability to see what you got while it 's still possible to re-shoot if you did n't do so well . ) With the $ 30 rebate currently available on the Jam Cam , you are getting a functional everyday camera for the cost of three developed rolls of 35mm film . How can you go wrong ? It 's also great for Realtors or Appraisers who have to take & quot ; disposable & quot ; photos for work .	1
I have more than 50 years experience with professional quality cameras and photography , so I feel qualified to give an informed opinion . If you are expecting Leica or Hassleblad digital quality this is not the camera for you . But if you want surprisingly good digital photos to send to friends or to sell stuff on eBay , this is a perfect solution at minimum cost . I liked mine so much I bought a second one.I understand it is n't compatible with Windows XP . This is not a problem for me because I use the latest iMac ( flat screen on a stalk growing out of the top of half of a basketball ) loaded with OS 9.6 and OS X , and the JamCam works flawlessly.Most of the problems I 'm reading about in reviews occur because the owners have n't bothered to read the manual . For example , battery life is n't a problem if you just follow the instructions and turn off the camera after use ( ..duhhhh ! ... ) I 've taken more than 40 shots on my first battery and it 's still going strong.Download the instruction manual , print it out , and READ IT . The associated & quot ; Most Frequently asked Questions and answers & quot ; should also be printed out because this list clarifies things not covered clearly in the manual . If you do n't read the manual and most frequently asked questions you wo n't know how to use the camera properly and you will be disappointed . 'Nuff said.You ca n't beat this little digital camera without spending big bucks . Quality of the shots is surprisingly good , even on printouts . Hope this helps.Al Thompson , Brady , Texas	1
I 'm not an audiophile par excellence , but I do know a thing or two about comfort . I bought the less expensive Sony MDR-V150 headphones for a song , and returned them after a couple of weeks because the darned things were very tight and uncomfortable . I would say that this MDR-CD280 is about the same in terms of quality , but leaps and bounds better in terms of comfort . I can wear these all day long and not even know they are on . And music sounds great . If you do n't want to spend too much , and you want comfort , you 've found the right product .	1
I was so anxious to get a camera case I almost bought a generic case for my S200 from Best Buy . Good thing I waited to buy this case , as it is far superior to any generic case I could have bought . This case is the perfect size for my Elph , it does add size to the camera , making it harder to get in your pocket , but the belt clip works great , so its hardly ever a problem . Good color for the case , and the front pocket holds enough to help out when you need another battery or flash card . The strap still comes out of one of the sides of the case , so you can still use it . Not a case to protect from the elements , but it will protect from impacts VERY well . For it 's price , less than the generic cases , and its great fit and quality , I would most definatly buy this case again if my current one were to ever wear out or become lost .	1
This is a nice little case from Canon that safely holds not only your S110 , but also up to two batteries , two compact flash cards , or one of each . However , this case does n't fit well inside the pocket of your jeans . It 's great as a belt clip case however . For more pocketable needs , I say just sew up a thin little bag for it out of non-scratching material like from cloth lens wipe . It 'll be paper thin and if you can find your mom or someone experienced in the field to measure it correctly , it would n't add any additional hassle when being used .	1
A must for extended sessions of photo taking - the Elph generates a surprising amount of heat . This battery is well engineered , incredibly lightweight and it performs . I 've recharged mine 50 or more times and it never seems to develop those & quot ; conditioning & quot ; problems that other batteries get.The most helpful advice I give to other Canon Elph owners : to conserve the battery , turn the LCD viewfinder off and just use its optical viewfinder like a regular camera to take pics . After taking a pic , leave the button depressed and it 'll pop-up in the LCD after a second for you to review it until you let go . I have yet to even open my backup battery using the camera this way .	1
I 've owned a Casio E-series Pocket PC since September 1999 and continue to use it daily at work , primarily for taking notes during meetings and reminding me of appointments or special events . Casio 's E-series devices has a well-earned reputation of posessing the best screen for indoor viewing and fairly good reliability , at least compared to the original Compaq iPAQs , their leading competitor . If you are considering migrating from the Palm platform to Pocket PC , or you 're entirely new to PDAs in general , the Casio E-125 is a good bargain -- it 's cheaper than the `` latest & greatest '' units since it has been out for well over a year and has no upgrade path to the new Pocket PC 2002 operating system but still provides all the functionality one typically uses a PDA for -- note-taking , date and appointment reminders , news reading ( AvantGo ) and occasional `` fun stuff '' like viewing MPEG movies and listening to MP3s.If , however , you want to get the most from your Pocket PC investment -- meaning you want to explore the latest technology has to offer -- I 'd recommend going with one of the Compaq iPAQs , since the entire line has flash-upgradable ROM ( Read Only Memory ) such that they can be upgraded quickly and inexpensively to the latest Pocket PC operating system . None of the Casio E-series devices have this feature , nor any other upgrade path to the new OS . Further , the new operating system supports ARM processors only , and the older E-series Casios run MIPS processors , meaning over time the number of new applications being developed for MIPS-based Pocket PCs will surely decrease . Still , if all you need are the features I mentioned above without the upgrade path to the newer OS , it 's hard to beat the price of an E-series Casio .	1
These come in handy when doing MSDOS work . I have had no problem with them . Remember , they work with external Floppy drives or computers with internal floppy drives .	1
The disks are at times hard to find , but was easy through Amazon.com . I expect a long life with them , and know they were coated correctly .	1
I AM IMPRESSED ! I finally decided to take the DVD plunge , so I looked online and decided on the Toshiba 1600 based on the glowing reviews it had received . Trust me , the reviews are accurate ! This player is rock-solid , has all the features an entry level DVD enthusiast could hope for , and plays every movie you put in . After talking to some friends who had players that would n't play certain movies ( The Matrix , The X-Men , Tarzan ) , I was relieved that mine plays every disc I 've tried.One side note : When I originally purchased this player , it was defective ( due to shipping damage ) . But Amazon.com took great care of me , shipped me a new one , and even checked it before they sent it to me . So , five stars for the player , and 5 stars for Amazon.com 's customer service !	1
The Toshiba SD-1600 DVD Player has every feature you need for a 4 by 3 or 16 by 9 Television . It has a Composite video output , an S output and a Component ( Red , Green , Blue ) output . For audio it has a Digital coaxial output for an RCA connector to a Dolby Digital and/or DTS 5.1 Receiver as well as Analog left and right outputs for Pro-Logic or Stereo play . The picture delivers 540 lines of horizontal resolution . It offers both DVD and CD text and also includes a Zoom feature . An excellent player for the money !	1
With DVD machines hitting all time lows in cost its easy to get caught up in purchising a poor unit in the 150 dollar range at Walmart . Do n't fret , spending the extra 50-75 dollars on this unit will be well worth your money . This nifty machine does it all ! It has digital sound , zoom feature , 30x Fast forward or reverse , dual tray disk , and the all important component video output . The component video output will be the standard in years to come in viewing movies . ( Basically compare HDTV to regular TV and you get the picture ) The draw back to the component video function is that you have to have a TV with component inputs . Toshiba is known for very bad remote controls , on this unit they surprisingly got it right . Its Light , small , and to the point . I have two Toshiba TV 's , and have been very pleased with them . So when shopping for my first DVD unit I was naturally drawn to them . But after comparing this unit to others like the Sony , and Panasonic the Toshiba price was more affordable , and the functions more abundant on this model compared to the others . Making this little beauty part of your entertainment center will be money well spent !	1
It 's a nice touch for the escort detector . The only complain is that I ca n't leave even the wire visible in the car because it 's a dead giveaway that you have a high priced descort detector in your car for people to steal .	1
The little clip that holds the cord into the detector is just as fragile as on the phone cords at home , and with the added heat exposure eventually will break , especially if you do not exercise reasonable care . I yanked on mine , it snagged under the seat , and I paid the price . Duh . Cheaper than on the manufacturer 's web site , and free shipping from Amazon is great too .	1
I have purchased my Targus Stowaway keyboard a couple of days ago off eBay , ... I have been using it for about three days to chat , type in notes , and respond to e-mails . It has definitely turned my PDA into a notebook . You would be able to perform anything with your PDA and a keyboard , as your productivity will certainly increase . You will normally be able to input 10 to 20 words per minute using the built in character recognizer , however you might now be able to type in at least three to four times faster than that ! ! ! The keyboard when unfolded , resembles an IBM Thinkpad notebook keyboard : black keys with white characters . The cursor keys are located at the right side , and their layout is the same as that on regular keyboards . In order to Page Up , Down , Home and End , you must press the blue 'Fn ' key located to the left of the spacebar.Folding and unfolding the keyboard is just wonderful . Measuring 13.8 '' WIDE when fully deployed , it just folds back to a mere 6 '' . Neatly packed , it would be roughly the same size as your PDA , but a little thicker.The keyboard folds in a shape that resembles the letter `` W '' . You pull away the two black and red handles to the edges of the keyboard 's case , tuck in the middle so as to have it raised . Crunch the end locks and there you go . Your keyboard is now neatly packed.In order to connect your PDA to it , the keyboard has got a built in docking port that tilts forwards and backwards , so that you can adjust it to have a nice viewing angle for you PDA while typing . Slide a metal and plastic retractable foot , as to have the back of your PDA rest there in a slanted position . This pedestal is made of metal , and it looks quite solid , with the exception of the plastic pedestal.You also get four dedicated application access keys , from which you can launch Inbox , Contacts , Calendar and Tasks . Press 'Fn ' plus these keys , and you will be able to access Notes , Pocket Word , Pocket Excel , and Microsoft Money . The functionality for these keys is hardcoded into the software driver , so you will not be able to change what applications they launch.The keyboard keys are normal size , and the feel is a little mushy , characteristic of a laptop keyboard . Key travel is identical to that of a laptop keyboard . Touch typists ( like me ) would sometimes need to punch in the keys a little harder , I think it is just a matter of time.The right side of the keyboard is somewhat cramped , it is easy at first to confuse the right shift for the right cursor keys , which lie next to each other.Keyboard driver is very easy to use , and allows you to 'Hot Dock ' and play with the keyboard as to just start typing . No need to turn off/turn on your unit to have the keyboard recognized.The software driver also allows you to configure up to 10 different application/document launch shortcuts , by pressing the 'Fn ' and a number ( from 1 through 0 ) .Overall , I am very satisfied with how this keyboard has improved productivity for me , and I think this is still the best engineered PDA keyboard on the market , no wonder why they have won several design awards .	1
This is a pretty good deal on a Kodak 1-megapixel camera . What is a 1-megapixel camera you ask ? Well , it 's about the maximum resolution ( the best ) you would want for a digital camera whose main task will be taking pictures for emailing or website posting . Higher resolution makes for larger files which require not only more time to upload ( i.e . to transfer to an email or to post on a website ) , but more time to download for your reader . In fact , the new 3-megapixel cameras make photo files so large that a person with a well-tuned 56k ( regular modem ) connection would have to wait almost 6 minutes to download ( view ) a single photo ! This particular camera then is well-suited to internet apps , and you 'll probably use it on lower than 1-megapixel resolution most of the time . PROS : 1 ) Price 2 ) Quality 3 ) USB connection 4 ) CompactFlash ( expandable ) memory 5 ) Through-the-lens shooting . CONS : 1 ) Limited zoom ( digital zooms are poor relatives of optical zooms ) 2 ) High battery usage 3 ) Mediocre flash capability .	1
The 880 is a compact digital camera which produces excellent images . It does have its good and bad points : Good points:1 . Nice body - resembles a standard camera - viewfinder is useful except for macro when you have to use the LCD to aim . It grips and feels like a standard camera , which makes framing and squaring up an image easier for those trained on old film cameras.2 . Easy to use - despite some claims , the instructions are clear , and for the most the settings seem intuitive . It is easy to move between the various preset exposure-speed settings . These are preferrable over the generic `` auto '' setting . The base `` auto '' mode makes too many compromises , and results in images which are just `` off '' .Bad points:1 . Missing some stuff . It comes with a small memory card , and without a rechargeable battery . Like nearly all digitals the Nikon inhales battery power . You MUST get a rechargeable battery , and a larger capacity Compact Flash memory card . Luckily the price seems to be falling on these . You should also get a card reader for your PC . Hooking up the camera to the PC is possible , but a card reader is far more convenient . No software included.2 . The lens cap must be removed manually , and if you forget to do so , you 'll get very angry and worrisome sounding whirling and grinding noises . Most basic point and shoot and APS cameras have a warning mechanism to prevent the recessed lens from deploying while the lens cap is on . The on/off switch is convenient , but at times too much so . It can be jostled and you 'll reach into your bag to discover it in the `` on '' position with the battery sapped . A firmer switch with a `` snap '' would be an improvement.3 . It is a bit pricey - I think that it would sell quite well , were it [ ... ] cheaper ... Still it is a nice camera with good technicial features , and capable of producing beautiful images .	1
My 1st digital , so maybe I 'm somewhat biased , got a great deal ( less then $ 500 ) on camera , battery , and charger was display unit , local Bxxx Bxx had close out on this model for some reason.The good : GREAT detail , 3.4 meg is fantastic , have had 8 x 10 's made , very comparable to 35mm.Easy to use in AUTO Mode Easy to use in SCENE ModeThe Bad : One irritating point is the & quot ; noise & quot ; the camera makes as it tries to focus . The Nikon 880 makes a lot of & quot ; whizzing & quot ; sounds as it focuses -- a bit too conspicuous in quiet environments.MUST have rechager and rechargeable batteriesNo photo editing s/w included.If you get beyond point and shoot , it is VERY complicated ! Bottom Line : I REALLY like this camera it takes incredible pictures .	1
For someone who wants to start taking great pictures , this turned out to be great camera ! I like how Canon has divided the dial into pre-set and creative zones so you can select to take a quick picture or use the easy programming feature to capture the scene the way you want . For example , you can select the shutter speed and it will select the correct aperture automatically . That makes it a lot easier for people who are not professional photographers . The best part is that by turning the dial to the green box I can use it as a point and click for those run-of-mill quick pictures . Its a regular Jekyll and Hyde , this one ! On the downside , a beginner like me had real trouble figuring out how to take great pictures using the manual that came with the camera . I found that the $ ... for the CANON EOS Rebel 2000 book by Heiner Henninges and Bob Shell was well worth it . If you are not quite conversant with Canon SLRs spent the extra few bucks and you will really enjoy using the great features of this camera .	1
I bought this Canon Rebel 2000 kit after much research and investigation - and I know I made exactly the right choice ! It is loaded with features if I want them , but it is also able to & quot ; point and shoot & quot ; when I do n't want to have to think about it . The most noticable feature is that it is as light as a feather - even when compared to my digital pocket camera . The seven focus areas are terrific , allowing for flexibility and creativity . I 'm an amateur and find this to be something I can easily operate but it leaves room to grow into later on.The most helpful thing in my decision making process to buy this camera was a visit to my local camera store to rent one for a weekend . The minute I got back the best prints I have ever taken , I knew I needed to have it ! Drawbacks - The instruction manual is nothing more than a glorified parts diagram . It is n't helpful for beginners or experts ... ca n't imagine who the audience is supposed to be . The flash is n't very strong - its purpose is to be a fill flash , not a substitute for a full-featured detachable flash . Knowing what I know now , if I had it to do over again , I would buy just the body and accessorize it myself .	1
First let it be said that I am a total novice at photography . I was looking for a camera with the ease of a point and shoot , but the flexibility of an SLR . This is it . It takes picture of exceptional quality and clarity , and in Full auto mode has super-sharp focus in a fraction of a second . It also has custom modes that will help you in specific situations , such as portraiture or high-action situations - like sporting events . The camera is also extremely light ! It gets comments on how light it is whenever I let someone hold it . I had it around my neck for an entire weekend , and never got tired . I highly reccommend it .	1
con este poderoso flash he logrado iluminar escenas donde hay muy poca luz , me gusta demasid , es excelente . adem & aacute ; s de sus controles manuales & automaticos .	1
I received my 28-200 yesterday from Amazon . Having read the customer reviews , I immediately put my Rebel XT on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my Canon 28-135 IS . Three shots each at f-stops 5.6 , 11 , and 20 , one set indoors at ISO 1600 and the other outdoors at ISO 200 . Focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera , highest jpeg setting . After shooting both series , I compared them fresh out of the camera , side by side . Results : the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances . It was visibly sharper at ISO 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20 , ( the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10 ) , and at 20 , it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background . The 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise . Both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in Photoshop . There are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . My conservative conclusion : the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your Canon ( unless you are going to drop $ 2200 on the L Series 28-300 IS and carry it ) , and the 28-135 IS has no clear sharpness advantage . Between these lenses , its a tradeoff -- -an extra 65 mm of focal length ( 105 mm after a 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability . Both lenses focus quickly and silently , and both lenses produce usable shots .	1
I have thoroughly enjoyed this camera for several reasons:1 . There is no better point and shoot camera.2 . It has well written instructions , that allow me to learn advanced photography.3 . It is relatively light ( without the flash ) 4 . All of the buttons are easy to use while taking pictures.5 . The eye tracking works well.But,1 . The flash is not adequate in the dark unless you are inches away . I got the 420 flash and have been very satisfied.2 . It does not have the time and date stamp . Not sure why considering the cost of the camera.3 . The eye tracking works well , but is not completely automatic . You have to know which modes to use it on.I would get the camera again.p.s . I was torn between an SLR and Digital Camera . I am happy that I got a SLR camera . I have my photos developed online , and choose which pictures that I want to have scanned at high resolution for Digital Photo Art .	1
As other reviewers have said , this is a great step up from the kit lens . I bought a Canon DSLR for a photo course . I 've been a shutterbug all my life ( going on 60 years ) and I decided I needed a retirement project . A photography course seemed just the ticket . Based on a recommendation on bobatkins.com I upgraded my 28-80mm , which was already an upgrade , to this lens . The 28-80mm was light and flimsy , kind of loosey-goosey . Took good pics mind you . But this lens blows it away.It is built better , more solid . The operation is smoother and faster . It covers a more useful range . And the picture quality is excellent . The experts may disagree , but that 's what experts do - nit pick.One caveat has to do with the geometry and interaction between the lens and camera . Depending on the camera , this lens is closer to a 45mm than the 28mm rated , but it goes out a bit farther . This is truer on older Canon camera models.I 've bought from KEH before and while you may pay a bit more you 'll get an honest evaluation and a guarantee . This lens is easily a step above the 'official ' grade they gave . If I did n't know it was used , I 'd swear it was new.An easy five stars both for the lens and KEH . ( update ) I just bought a 24-105 L lens . Honestly I do n't see a difference in picture quality . Given I shoot on an T2i , a crop body camera , I may be wasting glass , but the problem with most lenses are at the edges , your smaller sensor crops that nonsense so you get only the middle , the sweet spot . I 'll keep the L , but it 's way heavier and not much fun to carry around . I 'll probably only pull out the L to impress my camera snob buddies .	1
This is a good general lens . I bought a Canon 40D body only . The kit lens was out of stock and I was n't getting good enough reviews to wait around until it was available . I purchased this lens as my primary lens . I had read good reviews and it was well within the price range . The autofocus is quick and smooth and picture quality is very good-excellent . I think this is a great choice to replace a `` kit '' lens and not break the bank .	1
For the times when I want to travel light and only take one lens , I usually throw this lens on . Through its entire focal range , it does a great job . Its performance is exceptional considering it 's not an & quot ; L & quot ; grade lens.The lens is constructed well and has a nice feel . I have an Elan 7e body and this lens complements it very nicely . The Ultrasonic motor is definitely a nice touch . You ca n't even hear the lens focusing it 's so quiet , not to mention fast . I find that 28-105mm is a great range for everyday shooting , and if you 're into taking closeups , it has a fairly good macro mode ( although I wish it could be a little better ... Nikon 's equivalent lens has a macro reproduction ratio of about 2.7:1 , which this lens does n't come close to ... but it 's a Nikon ... bleh ) .I would advise anyone buying this lens to also purchase the accessory hood that 's available for it .	1
This is a very good all-around lens . When you consider price , image quality , and its range of uses via the zoom range available , it 's hard to beat.The image quality is hit or miss . Mostly , it 's just average or slightly above average . Again , though , I recommend this lens mainly because it 's flexible in its zoom range , not terribly expensive , has USM focusing , and takes respectable though not superb pictures . That 's a pretty good package of offerings if you want one lens to do a lot of different things within an attractive zoom range of 28-105.Of course , if you have an APS size sensor , as opposed to a full-size sensor , those zoom ranges are effectively 44 - 168mm . So , be aware that your `` wide '' end of 28 is not so wide .	1
This is a excellent lens for the price . I 've brought it on vacation several times since purchasing it in mid-August and I find that this is the lense I 've used probably 90 % of the time on my Digital Rebel XTI.Pros : Autofocusing is very fast and quiet ! ! Sharp and solid build.Cons : Autofocus shifts/stutters slightly in extreme low-light situations . No other faults that I 've noticed yet .	1
wish it had I.S . but besides that it 's a good lense , Pretty slow focusing at very short range probably because i dont have very steady hands , which is also why i wish it had image stabilization , but if you have steady hands I would n't worry about it . i tend to manually focus at that point , besides that its pretty quick and works well .	1
I 'm going to keep this pretty short and sweet . These headphones are a fantastic bang for the buck , with great details in the mids and highs , and are a bit more comfortable than Sony 's competing models and the `` ibuds . '' Now , where it ( somewhat ) lacks . The bass . These ARE earbuds so you have to keep in mind that no earbud model 's bass is going to overpower you with thumpiness . That said , for a pair of cheap earbuds the bass on these is very good and accurate , and is n't totally lost . The real star of this show , as mentioned before is definitely the detail found here . This is definitely worth the money , and is the best in its large and competitive class ; check out my other reviews to see what I mean .	1
Simply the best buds for the money . The sound is quite simply better than every earbud I 've ever owned , including the Sony and Koss series . If you have an mp3 player , go with these instead of the low priced Sonys on this site , they beat them hands down . Clean bass , excellent midranges , and crisp highs . Really , these buds wowed me and there is a reason why every audiophile forum on the web will mention these as a low priced alternative to the more expensive but mediocre earbuds you see on store shelves.Lets put it this way , if you have 70 dollars and need quality phones , get the legendary Grado SR60 's . If you have less than 50 to spend and you want earbuds , get the MX-400 's .	1
I was n't sure what to expect from a sub 15 $ range earbud.I basically dont like earbuds because they lack the fullness of the over the ear types . I had purchased the cheap Koss for 6 $ , and they were horrible , absolutely pathetic . The ones that came with my Creative Muvo were ok , average , but nothing great , mids and highs were not clear enough and there was no fullness . Then I purchased the Koss KSC75 which were terrific , but they are big and tough to fit in jeans . So I decided to get this one after readin reviews , and I am very happy . True senn sound , mid range is crisp and well defined , with voice getting good attention and at the same time not over powering the instruments . Bass is neat from an earbud , treble is where it should be , my only problem with it is the wire length , a cost cutting strategy ? ? ? Maybe . Cos it is not possible to keep the mp3 player in say your back pocket , best place wud be to hold it in your hand , which many ppl mite not prefer . But heck , sound is wat matters in the end and these are worth twice the price , maybe even more .	1
I got these for my wife for Christmas . She can not wear over the ear headphones . She says she absolutely loves these ear phones . I gave a listen and the sound quality is really good . Outside noise intrusion is also minimal .	1
I got these earphones primarily for the in-line volume control and the wind up case . When I fly , I like to listen to music on my PDA and on those very long flights , I like to watch the occassional DVD . Before the MX-500 , I simply had a cheap pair of philips earbuds that worked okay . I did n't realize how poor the quality was until I got my MX-500 . Much fuller bass and still very comfortable ( I chose not to use the pads that came with it ) . My only criticism is that the wire is sometimes too short at 3 ft. Of course , if they were much longer , I 'd be complaining about how long it was ...	1
I have 3 pairs of earbuds . This is by far the best . crystal cleat high , great mid and low ranges . Highly recommeneded .	1
I 'm a long time pro audio engineer . I buy lots of different headphones almost as a hobby . I have a pair of Etymotic 6i earbuds , the Sony 828s and now these Sennheisers . Although I record primarily jazz , I listen to alot of dance and hip hop . I believe the Etymotics and Sennheisers are pretty accurate and reflect the anemic bass output of the Ipod headphone amp . When I use the `` Classical '' EQ setting I get the kind of bass I like with these phones . Listening through my audio gear the bass-treble response is pretty true though . The Sonys do n't require any bass boost on the Ipod but do n't have the same liveliness on the treble side the others do . Have fun and experiment !	1
The earbuds are very light , fit my ears well and sound good for the price range . I will buy these again as my other sets of earbuds break or get lost .	1
For about $ 20 , and often less for persevering shoppers , Sennheiser has produced a fine set of earbuds.The MX-500 's give you a transparent , detailed , expansive and engaging sound that is reasonably neutral across the frequency band . They provide balanced , detailed bass ( no one insistent on `` THUNKA-THUNKA '' need apply here ) sparkling highs and a smooth midrange.IMHO , last year 's MX-500 's easily outperform this year 's successor , the MX-450/550 . ( See also my review of the MX-450/550 's on Amazon . ) The MX-500 's hold their own in my dedicated , `` high end '' headphone system , and in my very modest A/V system ( paired with Sennheiser 's DSP-360 for late night movie viewing ) .The Sennheiser MX-500 's are a genuine bargain , an excellent value and are destined to be a classic in the budget earbud category . So , buy at least two pair ( s ) : one for you , and one for your posterity !	1
Hands down , I think they are the best headphones for the money . I use them at work to listen to mp3 music and love them . Highly recommended .	1
It sounds great for classical music , acoustic instruments , etc ... but is rather weak on the bass for hip-hop and pop music . Even the standard earbuds that came with my Muvo have more bass.However , it is Sennheiser , overall quality is great , and it does come with a 2 year warranty , which is better than my Muvo earbuds which broke within a few weeks of getting them.The cord is only a meter long and a bit on the short side . The on-cord volume control is handy , and the blue color is nice.But for $ 15 , it 's a good deal . But it could be better .	1
I really liked these and the value/price ratio is exceptional .	1
We have 3 sets , so we have plenty of room to get around when one of us is sleeping , or playing video games . Lots of room to get around in the living room and kitchen when you have 3 sets slaved together . If you do n't need that much cord , even one set is still great . Plus they have a good set of adapters too ! A good deal for the price !	1
plenty of adaptors included to use on fixed and mobile pc recording platforms , no drag on head phones while recording	1
This has handy little things you always need from time to time . The coiled headphone extension is a neat , compact item . Like it better than the straight ones . Not so messy .	1
Does the trick . Stays plugged in when you extend the cord . Does n't feel cheap . I like to move around the room when I have the headphones on early in the morning and have the music cranked up . I did n't want to spend the extra money on wireless headphones , and I like my Skull Candy headphones , so this was the simple answer .	1
This is a cheap set , but for the price it 's worth it . It 's always nice to have a few extra of these adapters lying around , and especially to have the extension cord lying around . Overall , it 's a good buy , and I 'd buy another one or two or more if I needed to .	1
I 've only used the cord a few times but everything works great . I am especially happy about the adapters that came with the extension .	1
Very pleased with this set up . Got a 2nd set for our outdoor patio TV/Xbox set up . I much prefer the coiled storage than winding up the regular corded 12 ft extension we got . Totally worth a little extra for neater storage AND the adapters that did n't come with the other extension cord or my Sony headphones which I found odd ... .	1
Extra long cord for headphones . Great quality and good price . Works wonderful ! Would have no problem buying again from this company !	1
I chose this rating because honestly , how much can you say about a head phone extension cord . It works just fine .	1
My laptop is hooked up to a monitor . My hearing is not what it used to be so I always use headphones when I 'm listening . I sit at just barely the length of the headphone cord from the laptop , but I like to lean back and relax when I 'm watching something online . This is actually longer than I needed , but it works so well , I just hook the extra under the desk . No sound degradation and connections stay tight . Excellent product !	1
When we are traveling I use an extension with my Bose headset for watching TV . I like the coil feature over the Bose non coil cable .	1
This set was just what I needed and they performWhat more can you say about a cord that Works ! !	1
The cord is thick and sturdy , and the shielding is visible through the transparent jacket . The connectors are easy to handle . It 's pretty much a high quality Cat5 ethernet cable terminated on standard RJ11 connectors . As some have noted , the connectors lock in rather tightly . To disconnect , I push the tab all the way down and push the connector slightly to one side . That seems to permit the connector to release more easily.My house is an early 90s house with Cat3 wiring for the phone lines . Centurylink provides the DSL and I 'm paying for 20Mbps service . The service tech noted 17Mbps at the jack ( one of the longest runs in the house ) with his test equipment . While Speedtest.net is not generally an accurate measurement of bandwidth ( because it 's heavily dependent on the network and servers _outside_ of Centurylink 's control ) , I rarely got over 12Mbps during actual computer use.I started by connecting my DSL modem using a plain ol ' telephone cord . I ran three tests using Speedtest.net immediately before and after installing this hi-speed modem cable . I made sure to use the same test servers on the website . I saw no noticeable change in bandwidth after the hi-speed cable was installed.Was it worth the expense to me , even though I see no appreciable change in bandwidth ? Yep ... because for a paltry seven bucks I was able to remove one potential bottleneck in my network . Going forward as I improve the wiring in the house , I wo n't have to wonder if the old and basic phone cords are responsible for bandwidth problems .	1
does just what its supposed to do , it allows me to connect my laptops and transfer files when needed without thumb drives	1
I used this for plugging my phone into my car stereo . Nothing fancy . No problems . Finally upgraded to a full USB setup for my iPhone which is much better .	1
It is a good idea to wear an anti-static wrist band while handling sensitive integrated circuit cards like those in a computer , lest static discharge from the handler 's body may zap the circuit cards before they are installed . This Belkin Anti-Static Wrist Band with Adjustable Grounding is a good choice.The wrist band itself is about 9-1/4 inches long including the metal buckle . It is secured around the user 's wrist by Velcro . The unstretched coiled cord is about 21-1/2 inches long including the alligator clip and the snap button that attaches the wrist band to the cord . The snap button rotates all around and can be easily detached . The coiled cord provides stretching room . These features enable the user to move around freely while wearing this anti-static wrist band . I prefer to ground the wrist band to a metal gas pipe that goes into ground and I always test the continuity of the wrist band to ground with a multimeter before using .	1
Anti-Static Wrist band , does its job as advertised . Did n't fry my electronics when I was taking them apart . The only complaint that I have is that the wire could use some more length . Other than that , it 's all good .	1
It works well for what it is . Simple wristband to keep you grounded while you work with electrical components vulnerable to static electricity . Works well , I liked that I could just detach the coil and clamp from the wristband when I needed to walk away for a minute .	1
I bought this wrist band to help make sure I did n't damage my first computer build . It did n't restrict my movements at all when I was putting everything together . The only possible complaint is that the cord is n't long enough , but it 's a snap taking it off the case and putting it on again . And it 's only five dollars . If you want a cheap way to protect your hardware from static during your build , you should get this wrist band .	1
Purchased as a gift and it was a great hit , just what he wanted and could n't find in the store	1
Does it work as anti-static ? Absolutely . Just be aware the coils of the cord are wound so tight that it really does n't give you the distance flexibility that it claims . I wish the cord were a few feet longer .	1
Fairly comfortable for short term use , decent length on the springy cord . I do n't know if it helped but I used it to build 2 PCs and they work great . Probably not a necessary buy but better safe than sorry when building $ 1,000+ computers . I read on Tom 's that sometimes small , not-noticeable shocks can hurt performance without killing the component , so probably worth the investment .	1
Feel like you need a hazmat suit . Doing surgery . Got this for my PC build and no static problems at all .	1
Great price and it doesnt feel cheap.Does what its supposed to , a must have for anyone working with computers	1
Wrist band is of good quality , It is well made . It has a very strong alligator clip , stretch cord and velcro band .	1
Bought this because I was going to be putting a new PC together , which involved a lot of parts moving around . I do n't have a good floor for this , so the wrist band was a must . I 'd rather not take my chances with having to touch metal every so often.The strap fits well , and the cord seems to stretch far enough for my needs . However , the only problem I 've noticed is that the teeth are not as grippy as they could be . I 've had them fall off many a time from just reach a few inches past the tower , which becomes a bother after the 6th or 7th time . Oh well , it was cheap and it works . Ca n't complain too much .	1
Inexpensive and simple way to make sure you are not accidentally frying one of you chips when poking around inside your computer . It is easily adjustable to fit my wrist and the coiled cord extends without much force ( as it should ) .	1
This is cheap and does exactly what it is supposed to do . The button from the wrist strap is nice . The alligator clip is easy to attach to the case . Could be a little bit longer though .	1
Like I said I 'm no computer tech , but I 've learned to do a lot of my own work , so I need to be sure to save my products and myself . It 's very inexpensive and more4 thasn worth the price . If you 're going to work even one on your computer get this item it 's worth the low price and not damage an expensive computer .	1
Needed an antistatic wristband - this is exactly what I was after . This item was inexpensive and I was able to build my machine with no problems . Glad I spent a few bucks for the peace of mind . Nothing more frustrating than shorting out a part when you finally have everything you need to build or repair a machine .	1
Hey , If your building a computer why not buy this ? its very cheap and looks very cool on your wrist ( in my opinion ) . This wrist band is helping me build : CPU : Phenom II X4 955 Black EditionGPU : Radeon HD 6850HDD : Seagate Barracuda 7200 500GB 16MB CacheRAMCorsair XMS3 4 GB 1333MHzPSU : Antec BP550 Plus 550WRES : Asus 19in 1440 x 900MOBO : ATX Motherboard ( M5A97 )	1
This anti-static wrist band is definitely the best bang for your buck . I am an intermediate skill level system builder and this band is comfortable , has great reach , and the fact that the head rotates 360 degrees is great . Now if only I can stop losing them !	1
Works very well . I have never used one before and I really like it a lot ! Overall a great product !	1
I built a new computer yesterday and used this when handling the motherboard . It does a solid job of keeping yourself safe from ESD ( by the way , I worked on carpet - my computer works fine ) .	1
The tool needed when working with electronic equipment . Better to be safe than sorry . I know what static electricity can do .	1
Works as needed . Quality buy for anyone looking to keep accidental static discharges from hurting your computer system . Recommended 1 time buy , just to have over the years .	1
This is the first anti-static wristband I 've ever bought , but it works great . I 've never had a problem and since I just finished working on building my mini-itx computer I did a lot of stuff inside the case . Have n't had a static problem at all .	1

Belkin is one of the very best , what else can I say . I was not disappointed in any way with this product .	1
Great cable , well-made , sturdy . I 've disconnected/reconnected it quite a bit since I 've bought it with no problems . Highly recommended for everyday Ethernet use .	1
What 's not to like , it either works or it does n't . This one works just fine . I used to not be a big fan of Belkin products but I 've change my thinking over the years as their product quality has improved .	1
I have a Brother MFC-9840CDW printer and the cable works fine ! The blue is a great color because it is easy to detect from the black cords .	1
It 's a network cable , it does what it is supposed to do . The price was very reasonable . The color is nice .	1
Space in my bag is tight and I needed a short USB cable for my Canon mobile printer . Belkin makes quality products . If you need a 3 ' A to B USB cable , buy this cable .	1
These Belkin 3FT USB A to B Device Cable were only $ 0.01 each and I want 3 of them but got the order wrong and only got 1 . That did not help in the shipping cost .	1
Great product , nice and long cable , no flaws , although it is a bit awkward when it plugs in but what can you do .	1
I purchased a few of these to eliminate runs to power strips when I got a UPS . I have no issues with them , and they are powering both desktops and monitors .	1
In my Country in most computer stores it is difficult to find this 12ft power cord , and it is very common when you buy a new computer the power cord that ` s included is very small and sometimes not good quality.I specially recomend Belkin 12FT AC Replacement Power Cord ( AC Male to AC Female ) for those who like good things and need it for a big computer desk .	1
I needed a longer AC power cable to feed one of my monitors in a side-by-side monitor arrangement where the original power cable for the outside monitor was far too short . This cord was exactly what I wanted . While not as thick as say a PSU AC cable , it is perfect for a monitor and very supple which is great if you want to do some cable management to create a clean work space . I 've very pleased with this cable and will probably buy more of them as I have need . Price is right , and free shipping , so you ca n't really go wrong here .	1
I needed a longer cord for an amplifier I was setting up , and did n't want one of the chintzy ones you can pick up at the local dollar type store ... this cable is a good length , and is nice and sturdy . Works perfectly , as expected , and I do n't anticipate having any issues with it at all .	1
Does exactly that . Nothing further to be said . Feels durable and has a great connection . Get this one if you need to extend your cable length !	1
I needed this for my dsl connection . Would have cost me more if I had of purchased it from att .	1
Surprisingly this landline phone cord , RJ11 , splitter is now hard to find in convenience and other retail stores , Glad to find it and at a good price .	1
This coupler works exactly as expected . The cables plug in and they stay there . I 've had two cables plugged into this coupler and left exposed to the elements in Afghanistan for an entire year , zero problems . How 's that for a durability test ?	1
- Basic Cat 5 network cable from Cisco-Linksys name brand- Little more expensive than some no name brands , but worth a couple more dollars for good quality- Connected to a desktop PC and internet is working perfectly- Would buy again !	1
This is a quality cable for the money at a good all around length . It works fine for me and i recommend it..	1
Product is of very high quality . Service of purchase was excellent . In particular , this cable is quite soft which makes the routing extremely easy .	1
Why pay 5 times more in a local store when you get the same cable on Amazon at a fraction of the cost . They work great hooked up a desktop computer and a printer to the router . I am very happy with these cisco cables .	1
Do n't have to move computers around to access router anymore . Great to be able to plug in laptops without reachingtoo .	1
A length of Cat5 cable I needed while hooking up my home stereo . Came in good shape and worked as well as you would expect . The clips are good quality and seat nicely into my devices .	1
I found this to be a very solid product that works very well . Unlike what was written in other reviews , the RJ-11 connectors fit into my wall jacks and fax machine perfectly and are easy to remove . I strongly recommend this product . Great price .	1
Do n't get ripped off at other stores , this is the same USB cable for much much less . I got jacked buying this for $ 20 at a local box store but then I found this . Works fine with all the equipment ( printers , arduino , scanner ) what else can I say ?	1
Why is it the cable you need is either too short of not where you last saw it ? They seem to disappear just when you need them , do n't they ? Well Belkin is known for quality cables and a ten-footer is longer enough for nearly any job yet can be coiled for storage when not in use . So why not have a spare and one that is longer than the original ?	1
I have been buying these for years . They are the reasons I started an AMAZON account in the first place . They are awesome . Same ones sell for over $ 30 @ retail stores . This is very high quality with NO loss of data . Just as good as being directly connected to the USB . 10 feet of smooth sailing and quick spooling !	1
Very well built and great length too . Im just typing now to add more words because its a printer cable and It works as advertised .	1
one can not write poetically about cords , but I can say this is super value . Much less than I saw on the market . Works great , quality is superior to what I was checking out for comparisons , and I was so THRILLED to have the longer length.If you need extra USB cords , this is a good deal .	1
I buy a lot of cables and this is one of those types that if you get one get a quality one . Belkin is a good quality for a very reasonable price .	1
Decent build quality on these cables . Decent price with a name brand . However , the tripp lite 15 ' was a little less money , and just as nice . So , if you need the extra length , take a look at it .	1
Ok you can spend $ 40 for these at the retail stores . This cables work just fine .	1
I bought a label maker that is n't a printer but I did n't know that at the time . This cable was suggested to buy with the label printer by Amazon so I bought it but did n't need to .	1
Nice to get a package on time , sealed in original manufacturer packaging , and at a nice price . Resolved a problem I was having with a cheap USB printer cable .	1
I am using this cable with a multiuse Brother printer . Been using it for 6 months now and it is working perfectly . Well built .	1
This is the same product you can buy from the local office supply store for much more money as it is a high profit item .	1
This cable is perfect for extending the reach from the computer to the printer . I 'm very happy with the product .	1
This cable is built well and works well . The price is cheap . No reason to buy the overpriced cables the retail stores want to sell you . I used this cable to connect my computer to a USB printer .	1
As many of reviewers have noted here , usual brick and mortar stores sell these cables on the borderline of `` rip-off '' states . For the price I 've paid for these cables , it 's well worth the money . I primarily used the cable for connecting my laptop to my printer . It functions as well , no problems as well . The connector head on both the laptop side and the printer side are of higher quality .	1
it does the job . It is 10 feet of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable , lol , what more can I say ! it worked ! Did n't need to send it back !	1
Exactly what my iMac and my new wireless Brother Printerneed to stay in touch ! After connecting the USB cable between the ports of both machines , all I need do is turn on both PC and all-in-one laser printer , click theon-screen print option , and let my wireless hum and fast-print.Just right .	1
I did n't really need this cable . The scanner I purchased comes with all of the cables I needed . I figure I just have a spare cable now .	1
Simple and straightforward . I needed a nice long cable to reach my printer . This works perfectly and was about 1/4 the price of what I found at Best Buy.Could n't be happier .	1
I lost the USB for my printer and this one works awesome . Great price on a high quality product . I would recommend highly ! ! !	1
Got here in two days thanks to Prime ! Perfect length -- sometimes 6ft just is n't enough to wrap through desk and go around corners . Great price ! Make looks fine to me . Snug fit in the computer USB port . I would purchase again and recommend this to anyone .	1
When I purchased this product I thought I was getting a USB version 1 cable . It turned out to be 2.0 . Fortunately the package said it was backward compatible and it was.The book that came with my printer stated I needed a USB cable with a length of no greater than 6 foot , shielded , etc . They should tell you this before you get the printer . Fortunately , the 10 foot cable connected and worked flawlessly . I always try to buy Belkin since they generally have top quality products and good support .	1
With the outrageous prices the office and computer stores charge for this same cable , this was a great deal . I like to keep an extra cable in my mobile office bag . I work as a bookkeeper and tax preparer and need reliable cables as I travel to clients with my computer and mobile printer . This cable is perfect .	1
Exactly what I expected when I ordered it . It works great for my printer and allows me to store the printer in an area where I can bring my laptop to it to print . Nothing amazing , just a solid product .	1
Good price on cable with a convenient 10 foot length . Works as it 's supposed to .	1
This is a top quality cable for a good price . I had no problem with it . I would recommend it to anyone needing this type of cable .	1
Printer works fine on it and it is very long for the price . Always buy more cable than you THINK you will need , and you will never have to buy another one when you move something ...	1
Seems I always need an extra cable . Belkin makes the best accessories for computers and this cable is one of them . Not a great Christmas gift , but if you give a USB device , you should give the cable to connect it .	1
This cable works great . I needed a longer one to move my scanner to a book shelf and this did the job with no problems .	1
Value buy , works as advertised . Definitely beats buying expensive cables from the local electronic chain store.You wo n't regret this purchase .	1
Works great , not much else to say except that I much prefer the black ethernet cables to the standard white .	1
Have had cord for over a month , works exactly as it should . would recommend to anyone looking for good cord .	1
Works as expected ; I decided to go with this one because Belkin is at least a name brand and was worried with a few other on Amazon I would get a poorly terminated or cheap connector.The cable is 'white ' in the networking world ( it is slightly gray ) ; however I used to run network cable at an old job and gray network cable is definitely 'gray ' ( think the color of the bottom of an old Nintendo ) . Be aware that in your home it is unlikely the cable jacket will 100 % match your white trim as mentioned by other reviewers .	1
ordered the wire on July 4th and had the item on 6th . Item was correct and the price was great . Al	1
Set up was simple . Plug and play . I 've been using Belkin products for nearly 20 years . Never a problem . Recommended .	1
A USB cable is essentially a commodity . There is a minimum standard of acceptable quality , anything above that is unlikely to be beneficial.This cable comfortable exceeds the minimum standard of acceptability , and it 's price is a whole order of magnitude cheaper than it 's competitors in stores .	1
Excellent cable for computer and printer .	1
I am using this cable for my brand new brother laser printer and it works great .	1
I have several Belkin cables and they typically are high quality . They feel firm in the hand . I like the molded connectors since they seem to add durability . I purchased two of these 16 foot cables . One connects a Line 5 PodXT Live and the other a Yamaha MagicStomp Acoustic - both are guitar amp/effect modelers and both are connected to my computer which is on the other side of my studio compared to my guitars.I 'd buy again without reservation .	1
It is a very good product . Works great with my new All in one printer . Shipping was decent enough .	1
This is a nice , seemingly heavy duty cord , and the price ca n't be beat for what you get . Would buy again if I needed another long USB cord .	1
Worried that it might be to long to work reliably on our printers - so bought three different brands from Amazon , including this one , that had ratings where reviewers mostly stated that it worked for them . Would not have bought with out those mostly positive reviews.I could have went to a local Office store and paid as much as $ 25 for a similar cable , but that 's not me . But was glad to try 4 of the best rated cables from Amazon for about $ 7.00 each.They all worked fine , including this one . So thanks for the prior reviews from the other users.Perry- Arvada CO	1
This is a great cable if you are cramped on space and need to move your printer to a distant location . works for me !	1
Bought this to locate my printer a bit further than a 6 ' cable would allow . Works flawlessly ! One of the best deals I 've found .	1
Has a nice smooth feel to it , good solid connectors that wo n't break quickly . Belkin makes great cables .	1
The cable itself is fine . Works great , and I wont fault the cable , the seller , Amazon , or Belkin , I just hate stupid snagless boots . I was n't paying attention , all I was looking for was a 25 ' cable . I was focused on25 ' , and Prime shipping . I always wind up trimming them down with a knife , because they drive me nuts , especially when you have big meaty claws like me , and when you 're moving them from port to port on a rack-mounted switch that 's already cluttered.. Oh well.. Got ta read better next time	1
Nice quality . My past experience with Belkin products has always been positive.Nice snagless material.colors make it easy to organize.Ran threw beams and down a wall to the back of a AV plate , worked great	1
I needed a long cable to wire my computer from my living room where my internet came in to my bedroom where my computer is for a while until I could afford a wireless set up and it worked absolutlely wonderful AAA+++	1
This printer cable is almost $ 20.00 at Walmart . I was in no hurry so I ordered this cable . It came in only a couple of days and is a high quality brand name . I only paid a little over $ 3.00 what a bargain .	1
This Belkin `` Gold Series '' cable is a big step up from the typical cable . Durably made connectors with gold ends gives great signal response . It also uses higher quality plastic/rubber for more flexibility.As for the guy who says this is poorly shielded , I find it just the opposite . I bought this as a replacement for my OEM cable and it runs thru a rats nest of power cables in my office without the slightest interference.Highly recommended .	1
This cable is as advertised . It works well and looks good and solid . No issues . Good price . Recommend this cable .	1
I have used this since the day I bought it , and it works just great ! It is far more quality for the price than I expected .	1
Works exactly how it should . Used it to connect my laptop to my Vizio TV and it works awesome ! Quality is great , price was awesome .	1
Cable looks much better than Philips cable found in Walmart / Target . It is beefy and has high build quality and definitely made for high speed internet modem cable . Best and suggested over the philips cable .	1
I bought this for a friend who kept trying to talk me out of my set , The set I own is years old and came in a hard plastic shell but otherwise is identical to this set , the quality seems to be the same as my old one and it has lasted through years of my abuse so I do n't see anyone having any quality issues with this .	1
I recently purchased new laptop and wanted to give old laptop to aunt.Before I did , I wanted to upgrade the old Dell Inspiron 1525 Vista 32bit.I purchased an Intel processor and 4GB of memory.With the tools , that arrived in just a few days , I was able to slap in the new processor and the memory.Updated the OS to W7 and my aunt has been buzzing around with her & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; laptop.Tools were great for a novice like myself . I wo n't be a PC repair tech anytime soon , but at least I brought a smile to a family member with their 'fancy new laptop ' .	1
A good and inexpensive tool kit for the average computer user . Just right for someone who wants to add cards or change a fan . Very handy kit to keep next to your computer .	1
I have had one of these in the past when working on other peoples pc 's and small electronics . The shape and size of the tools is perfect for 99 % of the needs . Bought another one for my younger brother starting to get into the electronics field . He , also , loves the tool kit . Works as expected .	1
It is a very practical and handy collection of tools in a convenient case which served my need in good order	1
I have a Toshiba Satellite ( L645D-S4030 ) and I needed some laptop tools to install some upgrades . The Philips screwdriver worked perfect to undo the back panels which is mainly what I needed undone .	1
I purchased this for my father for Christmas , and he loves it . It is the perfect size , and it included all the necessary pieces for him to assemble his new computer we built him . The kit replaced a different Belkin kit that he had lost nearly all the pieces out of - I 'm so glad Belkin did n't disappoint me - it 's all too often that a great company will let their quality slide , but not this one !	1
I use the tape for cable labels mostly . Or other small parts or items . It sticks great and lasts in all temperatures , mostly . But is still easy to remove . Price could be a third less . : - )	1
This product is exactly as seen . It is good quality at a reasonable price . I will re-order these again and I definitely recommend them .	1
Does exactly what it says , it crimps RJ45 plugs onto Cat5 cable , it works well at this task , no complaints .	1
I bought this cable in order to replace my broken one . My old one was six feet long and so stiff that after only 2 months of use it ceased to function . This cable in the instances that I used it so far has worked perfectly with great picture and easy connectivity . Along with the fact that its only three feet long and costs a third of what I paid for my original cable its a great piece of hardware at a bargain price .	1
I bought this cable to use between my Lenovo laptop and a Canopus digital video converter . It works great with no issues at all . Not much else can be said about a cable other than it works and is offered at a good price !	1
I got first some chineses cables that were a 1/4 of the price and they did not work at all . spend more money and got these and works just fine . spend the money for this cable	1
I recently developed a rather urgent need for a PCI Ethernet Card . After upgrading my old computer from Windows 98 to Windows XP , I discovered that the PC 's old SMC ISA network adapter would not work under Windows XP . ( Should have listened to the XP Compatibility Wizard ! ) Based on price and reputation , I took a chance on the Netgear FA311 TX 10/100 Ethernet Card . I was nervous about installing it , based on some of the reviews below . But it seemed most of the complaints related to online gaming . My networking needs are not quite as demanding - browsing , email , Web design , a little Internet chess . So , I crossed my fingers and installed the Netgear into one of the available PCI slots . Both the hardware and software installations were a breeze . The FA311 worked right away , getting an IP address via DHCP from my DSL router . It 's kept working ever since - in fact , I ca n't say much about it , since it works so well . Should n't all Plug and Play devices be so invisible ? Users with special networking requirements might want to continue researching this and other cards . But for the average home user , the Netgear FA311 TX 10/100 Ethernet Card is a solid performer at a great price .	1
This PCI card is super easy to install , and what a difference it adds to the internet speed . Netgear products always come thru .	1
The 6 ' 4 pin to 4 pin Belkin IEEE 1394/Firewire cable does exactly what it says it should for relatively cheap . As long as you 're at the 400 MB/s standard as this is , there 's no need to spend $ 50 on a gold plated connector and superheavy isolation like the Monster cables . Firewire is designed to function up to 15 ' without signal degradation , and unlike analog signals the 0 and 1s of digital signals are n't subject to manipulation by electrical fields . Either they get through or they do n't , so as long as these are certified under the standard you save money by not buying useless frills . It 's shiny translucent silver , not black , but if you care that much about cable color you probably already have your cables isolated anyway.The 4 pin models work with most electrical powered devices ; the 6 pin models usually are for devices that need battery power . ( To tell , look at the cable input . If the Firewire port looks like a USB port it 's 6 pin , as the extra two pins carry current . If its tiny , it 's a 4 pin outlet . ) For those looking for an adapter for Comcast/Motorola HDTV-ready digital boxes , you 'll need a 6 pin cable on one end as Motorola decided to use a 6 pin adapter , where almost all HDTVs , DVHS VCRs , and PCs use a 4 pin . Recommended .	1
It works just fine and it was just exactly what I wanted . It fits the DVD recorder I have and works fine with my camera .	1
First make sure that you camera and computer have a 4-pin connection and work with a FireWire . If so , this cable is worth its cost in gold as it will save you a tremendous amount of time transferring videos and pictures compared to using a USB cable .	1
I need 250ft of bulk cable . Any more would have gone to waste . The Cat 5e works with gigabit ethernet under 100m so this is a low-cost alternative to Cat6 cable.Grey cable , bends decently , I ran about 60ft in the crawlspace of my house . Crimps/strips nicely .	1
This Belkin cable was on sale , so I bought it , however I was very pleased to see the perfect un-spoolling with no snags or hang ups , even when I was 50ft away from the spool . I would definitely buy this product again !	1
The SanDisk card reader is a good product for any Mac user with a USB connection . At first , I had experience some problems with the reader ( I had deleted images from the card , but it was not freeing up memory ) , but after I downloaded and installed the latest drivers from SanDisk , all my problems went away . The ease of use of this product was quite simply astounding . When you place a card in the reader , it will appear on your desktop ( assuming you use a Mac ) as any floppy disc or CD would . From there , you can copy the files to your hard drive by just dragging and dropping them into any folder on your computer . When you 've done that , just drag the files from the card to the trash and empty it . Voila ! You have just cleared the space off the card ! It really is simplicity in motion . I highly recommend this easy to use product .	1
It certainly downloads the images quickly . I do wish that I could run it through my USB hub instead of having to connect it directly to my Cube . Nice product for the price , though .	1
Awesome price , beats the Walmart price of $ 39 for same cable , but with fancy packaging	1
What can you say about an ethernet cord ? It is great quality , not like some of the cheap Chinese imports , the plugs are made well and wo n't snap off with use , the connections are tight and my TV sets that have TIVO devices on them are now connected to my home network by direct connection rather then Wi-Fi and the difference is amazing . Signal strength over the full 50 ' run is not degraded in any way .	1
It has everything I need for all my computer needs . Very easy to find the different tools and put them back afterwards . The long screwdiver is very useful for the larger computer cases .	1
So far this USB hub has performed flawlessly . It is small , unobtrusive , and less expensive than many comparable devices . It is holding up well with my video camera and DSL modem plugged into it , both of which suck down a fair amount of bandwidth.It may seems like a small thing , but the rubber feet on this USB hub are a big help . It stays right where you put it , even when you tug a bit on the wires . I have a & quot ; Fellowes & quot ; USB hub that also works fine , but costs more than the Linksys and does not have rubber feet . It slides all over the place , and has slid right off my desk before , which is pretty irritating .	1
I especially like how they did n't compress the arrow keys between the number pad and the rest of the keyboard . My only complaint is the power button ... it 's too easy to hit and I often ended up inadvertantly turning off my computer by hitting it . I simply took the key apart and it works fine .	1
I find the ergonomic keyboard extremely easy and comfortable to use . However , the paint used on the keys begs for improvement . Within a short period of time , the more used keys completely lose their markings which leave something to be desired .	1
I purchased these headphones for the sole purpose of using them with a scanner at NASCAR races . The headphonesfit well and the sound was great . Excellent ear protection ! ! !	1
These work great but are made to fit tight over the ears to keep out surrounding noise . I gave them to my grandson and ordered myself some lighter ones for myself that I like much better . These also have a strange bar and strap to keep them firmly in place , which would make them ideal for moving around a lot or bending over .	1
I love Koss headphones . I have so many different types , from noise cancelling , to wireless mp3 , and I think Koss is number 1 . I have other brands , but usually I trade them off or just give them away . These headphones really cut out noise , not just reduce noise , but they eliminate noise . I farm , and raise horses , so I use these headphones while working on the tractor , with very loud and large hay mowers and bush hogs ect . I would not recommend these if you are working in areas where you need to hear , ( such as a stallion barn , or training arena ) , but with heavy , loud machines you ca n't beat the Koss QZ-5 . And the price is right too ! I only wish there was a wireless version of these . They also fit around your ears perfectly , so they are comfortable to wear for long hours of work . I hate round shaped earphones , ( they hurt ! ) These also are sturdy and tough , ( like me ) and they fit snug enough to stay in place no matter what you are doing . Yes they are big , but that is how they are supposed to be , these are for hard work , not laying around the swimming pool If you need less size and better sound I recommend the Koss Tugo , I own a set of these as well and I love them ! I guess I am a Koss customer , but I go with what works , and great customer service and high quality works for me .	1
Received this item faster than expected , ( thank you Amazon ) . Cables in excellent condition , and serve their purpose . I would suggest these cables to anyone looking to expand their wired network at a great price !	1
I love using this kit . Everything I need is inside . Very useful to cs-men like me . Quality of each tool is also very high	1
This took kit is not bad . It has a lot of things that I did not have , all in a handy case that is attractive and will be able to easily accommodate replacement tools as the originals wear out . I have to agree with many people about the flashlight . It is a piece of junk . It does not even have an on-off switch . You have to unscrew the light bulb holder part to turn it on and off , and if you do n't unscrew it enough , I guarantee that your batteries will run down very fast . If you are a professional , you will probably feel like this is junk , but if you are just wanting to fix your own laptop , this will give you the tools that you need .	1
However , the soldering iron is not all that good , i 'd recommend getting something a bit more professional , other than thatthe tools available are pretty much standard and covers your basic needs . ( at least in my case ! )	1
I rated this a 4 stars because some of the tools slip out of their holsters very easily . But it does come with a lot of useful tools that I use almost everyday .	1
Good basic electronics toolkit , the soldering iron and flashlight both leave a lot to be desired , but other than that a good basic electronics toolkit to have around the home/office .	1
This is the best item I 've bought so far from amazon.com . The kit is just as you see it but even more exciting with it in your hand . I feel like a genius holding this kit and much more when I use a tool from it . The tools are sturdy and precise . Every single piece works well . This is the ideal thing for any computer technician whether at home , work or on the go . I love it . And the price ? unbeatable . Saw the same thing in a store and it 's more than five times the price here on amazon.com . Thanks again amazon.com .	1
I dont see any reason not to score fine , it does what it says it will ... ive connected my PC to my 32 '' LCD and it works fine ...	1
Works fine for me . On a 23 '' LCD monitor and provides great image . No shaking , no lines , nothing negative to say . Needed a long run and this was the most economical purchase .	1
It is possible to download a Windows XP driver for this device . However , you really do n't need one . I tried the touchpad with the XP driver and without , and found that the pre-installed generic XP driver provided smoother cursor motion . Of course , if you want all the special Glidepoint features , you need the XP driver from the Fellowes Web site , but I found the Glidepoint features to be more annoying than helpful , and the cursor motion became somewhat unpredictable . I recommend just hooking this device up to your Windows XP machine and letting the pre-installed XP ( Home Edition ) driver do the work . If you do , you 'll find that this touchpad functions exceptionally well , and is a great value for the money - much better than those combo keyboard-touchpad devices , which are harder to use and less ergonomically satisfying .	1
The price tag always put me off . It was so much more than the bargain ones . But I spent so much more on bargains than if I had just bought this one in the first place . This does n't mean I will stop buying bargain prices in other products , as most of them end up being great products . But in number pads , the cheap ones were cheap for a reason . They did n't work , did n't last , and were uncomfortable to use . This one takes care of all that . It is solidly built , the numbers depress and return like a dream and is extremely comfortable to use . Do n't waste any more time on the junk . IBM got this right and it is well worth the price . Do n't let the `` for Thinkpad '' stop you . It works on my Dell and my Asus and I would guess on any computer that has a USB port.IBM Numeric Keypad For Thinkpad USB	1
This was a great purchase for my Dell XPS laptop since the laptop does not have a keypad and I use the number function often . This worked great when I plugged it in and the XPS recognized it with no problems .	1
I just got these babies yesterday and I 'm so happy with them ! I was pleasantly surprised to see `` assembled in the USA '' on the box too . I 'm burning them in and when I 'm done I 'll leave a better review . I 'm going to DJ with these old school looking headphones . I gave them a test last night and they worked great with my Denon MC3000 and Virtual DJ setup.4/17/13 They are a treat to DJ with because of how well they isolate the sound and with 24 hours of burn in on them so far they sound both amazing and much better than they did out of the box.5/16/13 They are the best DJ headphones I 've used hands down . They isolate background noise so well , play loud , are strong , and look so damn utilitarian cool that I ca n't imagine what more any DJ could ask for .	1
Koss Pro-4AA Studio Quality HeadphonesComfort issues being what they are ( and they are real , but not insurmountable , at least for me ) , the performance of these babies is ONLY limited by the equipment used to drive them , and the quality of the recording . Period.Ipods need not apply.I 've got mine running from software ( Foobar2000 with digital eq , four-channel converter , and Dolby surround headphone listening room wrapper plug-ins ) to a high quality pc soundcard , then through a OP2132 OpAmp , and I 'm still not convinced I 'm getting everything I can out of them . Heart 's `` Dreamboat Annie '' disc never sounded better.I ca n't stress enough that whether you call it a virtue or a weakness , these phones WILL NOT lend a faux-audiophile sound to run-of-the-mill gear , like some modern phones will . If you have n't spent a lot of time/research and/or money on your equipment purchases , good luck with these.They are built to last , if that helps.Enjoy at a safe decibel level ; - ]	1
I got these as the second warranty replacement for my discontinued Koss A130.Koss initially sent me the Pro4AAT . They were terrible.On the other hand , the PRO4AA sound almost as good as I remember my father 's sounded.Good clarity ( could be better ) , good dynamic range , good imaging , good basses , good midrange , good highs.Build quality leaves lots to be desired , they look cheaply made , the foams under the ear cushions are in different places from one side to the other . The piece that has the hinge pivots is poorly molded , and it is almost cutting sharp.Koss sent them , as I said before , as warranty replacement . They were in a box that badly deformed the head band . After reshaping the the head band , they fit comfortably with just the right amount of pressure on my head/ears . Even though they are on the heavy side , I can listen comfortably for hours.I would recommend them to my friends with a warning about the build quality .	1
I used to listen to music on a pair of these that my dad had , eventually the oil filled hear pads died on his and I do n't know what happened to them.I was amazed to see Koss continuing to produce and give the lifetime warranty to these iconic cans ! For the price you simply ca n't ask for a better headset.Wire boom mic mount attached to the left can is probably a bit of a mystery to anyone under the age of 40 . You can unscrew the silver clamp on the left side of the headset and attach a wire boom arm for a microphone . Think helicopter pilot and you will have the right image in your mind . Do n't plan on finding a compatible mic ... you will have to build your own . That was always the case , even when these were new technology.They are a bit heavy and can get a little uncomfortable with long term use . I have found that a beanie can help reduce some of the discomfort caused by the head rest.Recommended for anyone who wants a great pair of 1/4 & # 34 ; headphones .	1
Im a videographer & Editor . I use these headphones out in the Field a lot . They can take a beating and help me to hear in loud venues . Somethime I use them for Video editing when I want to crank up the volume & not disturb my roommates or anyone living near me .	1
We have `` distinctive ring '' service on our phone line : the line has a second number associated with it ; when that number is dialed the phone rings but with a distinctive `` short-short '' burst rather than the normal ring . This device allows us to use this second number as a dedicated fax number . It senses the distinctive ring and routes the call to a fax machine ( or , in our case , to a desktop computer that also receives faxes ) . When the phone rings normally , the call is not rerouted -- we can pick it up or our answer machine will if we do n't . We have found the device very reliable over a month 's use ; once set up , you can forget it , it just works . I 'm not sure how . It is connected to one of three extension jacks for this number ; the answer machine and another phone are on a second line , but this is no problem.It has one important limitation : the only distinctive ring it can sense is the `` short-short '' -- our phone company also offered other options . If you chose another option , you have to revise that choice to the short-short ring for this device to work . The device also requires programming to align it with your setup . It comes configured for a setup in which there is no distinctive ring service . In that case , the device apparently senses whether the incoming call is from a fax machine or is a voice call , and responds appropriately . I have no experience with that function . To set it up for my situation , I had to call the support line , as I was not successful using the instructions that came with it . But the support line worked ok , there was very little wait , and i got someone who was able to help with little difficulty . A more convenient programming set up is all the device needs for a five star rating , in my estimation .	1
There 's not much to write here other than these APC replacement batteries last years in my two APC 1400s . A little bit of a hassle to swap out , but that 's pretty much down to the case of the UPS itself . Recommended .	1
It works great and a great buy at the price !	1
This is the first monitor I have really grown to love.Here 's why . :1 : It 's big . Real big.2 : The screen is FLAT ! ! Way less glare.3 : The screen is perfectly bright . It 's settings allow brighter display than most.4 : The resolution is awesome . Handles very high resolution w/o overheating or anything.5 : It 's a perfect exterior color , likely to match your computer system and surrounding environment.6 : It has a classy design.For me , it 's just a perfect monitor ! ! I 'd way rather have it then pay almost double for a decent 15 '' flat panel monitor . Maybe in a couple years when flat panels have higher resolution ( like the HDTV flat panels ) and when they are way cheaper , then I 'll buy a big one of those . But for now , I have the desk space.My monitor provides me the perfect computer environment . Since the screen is a dynaflat , sunlight reflection does n't irritate me as it used to with my other monitors . Since it 's also big , I now lean back in my chair , lift up my legs and rest my cordless logitech keyboard on my lap . My back feels better . My shoulders feel better . My wrists feel better . My eyes feel better . My whole body feels better.Just make sure you do what 's right for you and get the best monitor you deserve . I love this one . I 'd recommend it to anyone .	1
What is good : Fantastic optics . You should set it up never to use the digital zoom . If you need more zoom than the optics provide , do it yourself later in Photoshop . Great ergonomics . Great battery life ( close to 2 hours including file transfers . ) What it needs : An optical viewfinder . Non-proprietary memory ( though at least it 's not overly expensive . ) An extra battery ( always keep one ready to go . ) The next generation : A charging / file transfer cradle ( drop it in the cradle and you 're good to go . ) I LOVE MY DSC-F505V !	1
I was first peeved about having to be stuck with a predetermined Sony memory stick format . But after continued use in TRV900 , TRV11 handycams and the Sony Clie PDA- I have to say I 'm very happy with the memory stick 's flexibility . I usually hate being stuck in a specific company format , but at least Sony did it right.The transfer rate in the Clie is very rapid . Backing up the entire contents of the Clie takes literally a few seconds . The Clie has a program that allows you RUN programs off of the memory stick . This is not the fastest operating speed , but it is no worse than a Zip drive disk.The size and reliability is unbeatable . Compared to a San memory card that has lost it 's life after 1 year , the Sony memory sticks have performed flawlessly for pics , data , and application runs . Go for the 64+ MB and up - just like a hard drive , you think a realistic amount is adequate . But once you start shooting and using , you 'll wish you upgraded for the bigger stick .	1
I really like this filter and the opportunity to really enrich a photo by eliminating the glare . With that said , at first I was not sure that it was working correctly , as I was not getting the results I was expecting . I then realized I had no idea how to use it ! So for those that may not know , you need to the 90 degrees to the light source in order for the polarizer to work , or close to it . Once I learned , I really like it ! I would and have recommended this product !	1
If you want your outdoor/landscape shots to really look great , this filter is a must have . Skies are more dramatic , colors are richer and unwanted glare is reduced . The outer ring rotates smoothly and is easy to use .	1
I already own polarizer filters for other lenses in my bag , so this was an addition for a specific lense.As with any filter , air to glass surfaces add distortion , although I have n't seen any problems in my images with this ; Tiffen makes a good quality filter for the price.I would recommend this polarizer to any photographer serious enough to want to one to their camera bag .	1
This Tiffen filter is a great quality product . i have put it to the test in midday sunlight ( its summer here in NZ ) . This is a good quality filter that does not degrade image quality . Also very easy to clean . I would recommend Tiffen to anyone who is looking for an affordable high quality filter .	1
I 'm still a working on my photography but I do think that this is a big help to get to the depths of water and for cutting down on sun glare .	1
This polarizer is useful to reduce excessive glare on my outdoor shots . The polarizer can be rotated to control the amount of polarizing effect that your camera gets.Overall this is a good buy for almost any kind of DSLR camera to enhance outdoor photos and giving that deeper blue sky and more vivid tone of outdoor shots .	1
This filter is very good and delivers the expected results . Very little color tinging , and good quality construction . Excellent choice for photographing daylight outdoor scenes .	1
I own a Panasonic video camera and needed some glare reduction on it and so this seemed like the perfect choice between price and function . The filter does spin as it needs to be set but this is a bit unsmooth for my liking . Other than that , it works well .	1
The Tiffen 77mm circular polarizer is an excellent product , I am very happy with it , the service provided from Amazon was great and I will buy other Tiffen products from Amazon again .	1
Tiffen has always been one of the top leaders in lens filters and I was happy to see this at such an incredible price . What an improvement on my photos !	1
Nicely made , smooth movement . No obvious workmanship flaws or glass imperfections . Makes for rich coloring , as expected . Wonderful . No hesitation in recommending this reasonably priced polariser .	1
Good quality , especially for the price . However , as a newby photographer , I learned something ... circular polarizers do n't really work very well on ultra wide angle lens 's ... too much variation in color change across the viewing angle expanse . Better to use polarizing filter plates .	1
I bought this after it was recommended to me as a way to make my pictures more vibrant and to reduce glare . It works perfectly ! Sadly , I lost it on a shoot in the country , and I bought a Vivitar as a replacement when I was at a camera shop . Bad move . This Tiffen filter gives a much better result . I will be purchasing another one .	1
I have both the 52 and 58mm circular polarizers from Tiffen and they both work fantastically . The outer ring spins easily and smoothly , and the filter does n't reduce the image quality one bit . This is a must have for taking outdoor pictures as it really makes clouds pop and cleans up reflections . Want to get a shot through a glass window ? Use this filter to prevent unwanted reflections from getting in the way . Like your framing and exposure , but getting blown out reflections in that lake ? You 'll lose a stop of light , but it 's worth it to get rid of those stray sunbeams in the water.I 've taken them both on numerous hikes and in some fairly dangerous conditions . I 've thrown them in my camera bag without much regard to their safety , and yet they work fine without any scratches . For the money , Tiffen is great .	1
Maybe if I was a professional photographer I would buy a different product but this is good for me at a very reasonable price .	1
Even though Nikon lense covers are thick and of excellent quality , Tiffen brand is just as thick and almost equivalent in quality . A great price and fast shipping .	1
Well constructed . Has a quality feel . Made in USA.It polarizes the light coming through your lens -- twist the two-piece filter ring to see the variation.It 's not easy to operate with a lens hood on . I reach into the hood to twist the filter ring , but that blocks part of the viewfinder while I 'm doing it . Not a huge problem .	1
I had previously purchased a cheap circular polarizer filter and I could not get my lens to focus properly with it on . So I spent a little more on this filter and I am very pleased with the results ! It worked great and has fine clarity . I 'm looking forward to creating much better landscapes with this filter .	1
Works fine . Enhances color and makes sky and clouds more pleasing to the eye . Good value . Threads match perfectly . Rotation is smooth .	1
A must for large aperture lenses . Great for long exposures and bright conditions , or just experimenting with . I keep a range on hand .	1
i like this filter too much , but i think it need more deep color , but the pictures that i took with this one are sooo great for real , completly recomended	1
Ca n't complain , eliminates reflections nicely and the colour saturation on rotating the cpl produces a very nice vibrancy . I am pleased .	1
Polarizers are surpisingly expensive , with the nicest ones ranging up to or even over 100 dollars ... this one , at right around 20 $ seems just about right . I get nice deep blue sky colors with it , deeper greens , and that cool transparent/anti reflection/glare effect shooting into water , which is just what i wanted . I really do n't plan on using it all that much , so anything more expensive just would not have been worth it to me . That being said , I 'm not sure how big of a quality difference in image quality there might be between a filter of this price and some of the more expensive ones , but for me this one is just perfect .	1
Arrived on time . Ordering from Amazon , as usual , was very easy . Also the price was reasonable . I have other Tiffen items and this is a great addition .	1
I used this on a videography shoot lately . Now it may not be one of those top of the line filters like the Pro 's like to use , but it gets the job done . I had no problem with it at all . I definitely give product a great review . Just set up your shots accordingly and you should be just fine !	1
I shopped around for quite a while to find the right polarizer lens for my camera and shooting needs . This filter really helps to enhance the colors of the photos I take .	1
I 've never used a top-of-the-line circular polarizer , but I 'm happy enough with the results from this one that I do n't think I will ever upgrade much above this one . It 's stayed free of scratches and cleans easily in the field.Used with various Canon EF L-Series lenses , you can see sample images at 500px.com/seannmhogan	1
I was worried how this will work for me , but it is.will explain the details later with pics if possible..- SJoseph	1
The lens works beautifully , and rotates cleanly . It is easy to install and remove and gives great results in my photographs .	1
Works as I expected . It was quite difficult to get on my Canon EF 10-22mm lens the first time . I thought it was n't going to fit , but then finally it lined up . Once it was on it worked great !	1
I bought both this Tiffen circular polarizer and the Tiffen Haze-1 filter at the same time . Shooting across a broad valley on a sunny day at some distant mountains I used both filters separately and together . The circular polarizer did a better job of reducing the obvious haze producing more saturated colors both in the viewfinder and on film . The Haze-1 did deliver a noticeable effect , but the circular polarizer was better and is priced accordingly . The atmospheric haze was so bad on that particular day that , without the filter ( s ) , the resulting images were useless . I had also tried a cheap no-name circular polarizer for comparison . This Tiffen was superior to the no-name by a wide margin .	1
This poloarized lens fits well and does what it says it will do . I 'm happy with the purchase . The price was right too .	1
a Polarized lens filter that works great . Packaged in original packaging , shipped very quickly . I would definitely recommend it for anyone .	1
This great quality Polarizer is attached on my Nikon D600 . It is always on my camera unless I am shooting indoor or in low light situation . Great for details when shooting outdoors especially when eliminating reflection from your subject . I would highly recommend this filter .	1
This is the only Polarizer I have owned but it seems to do its job just fine . I have used it to capture fish under the water .	1
When doing portraits of people with pale skin , they sometimes & # 34 ; wash out & # 34 ; into the background and you do n't see many of the facial features ; however , this filter does a great job of giving a little color to the person without it being noticeable that a filter was used . Great tool to have in your bag whenever shooting portraits .	1
Its a good ND filter for the starters and also it cost less then $ 17 . However it does not filter light well for long exposures ( > 3 secs ) . It reduce f stop only by 3 , however if you combine a CPL filter effects will be good . Built is good , does not feel like a cheap product .	1
Great filter , easy to use . It came and the case it was in had been damaged ( closing clasp had broken ) but it had not opened . The filter had a lot of dust on it , which was easilly remidied with a quick puff of the blower . I have gotten good results with this , it works as intended and gives me the 3 stops it advertises . I bought 2 of these so I can do a 6 stops . I can not see any optical issues with the filter ( even with using both of them simultaneously ) , so it is a great one in my book !	1
you can say many good things about Tiffen filters , good glass , well constructed.at the end is just that you ca n't go wrong with Tiffen	1
I have always been please with Tiffen filters . They are reasonably priced and are a good , sturdy product . Learned something recently - take off the UV protection filter before putting on this filter . Only one piece of glass should be at the end of you lens at a time , keeping the original lens as intact as possible .	1
I got this filter for my NX20 but it did n't seem to fit my camera lens , but besides that , the picture quality was great in very lit up areas , and it pretty much does what you 'd want it to do .	1
Tiffen makes good filters . What can I say ? It works ad advertised . used one on my SLR and wondered how they would work on my new DSLR . They work the same , and allow for more ceativity ni your shots .	1
For the price on this item , you really ca n't go wrong . It 's not & # 34 ; precision optics , & # 34 ; but for most photographic applications it works like a charm . This filter is great for experimentation with moving objects/water during daylight hours and you can use pretty much your full ISO range with it , depending on shutter speed . I spent a day in the woods with it and came out with some great results with little to no practice . Lots of fun for the hobbyist photographer !	1
While not the strongest Nd filter out there , it offers ( for my needs ) the perfect amount of power . I 'm very big on landscape and waterscape photography and this allows me to take the photos I want in just about all of the conditions imaginable . Some have stated that they ca n't get wispy waterfalls during the day and please allow me to correct them , yes you can and I will upload photo examples if someone would like to see them . I 've shot with this filter in all conditions , ranging from full sun to cloudy skys and it 's terrific ! Again , you do not have to wait for sunset ! The Filter is high quality , easy to screw on and off and it drastically cuts down the light passing through your lens allowing you to take some beautiful shots .	1
I do a lot of landscape photography and ND filters are invaluable for photographing waterfalls , winter scenes and many other views .	1
It 's doing the job , however It 's a little bit thick , because when I attach another filter over it , I start noticing some vignetting on the edges of the frame ( At 11mm f/2.8 ) . So it 's better to use it alone if your lens is ultra wide .	1
Seems good . Does what it is supposed to . And did not fall apart like a Hoya I had bought .	1
It reduces polarization as it should and rotates freely for you to adjust the amount of filtration . Just as advertised . Does n't come with a carrying pouch or anything , you 'll need that , and probably some cleaning wipes to clean off dust and particles after taking out of the package . I do wish there was a little bit more tension in the rotating ring , but it 's not too bad .	1
For under $ 10 ( not counting shipping ) , this is a good 'protector ' for the lens . Have taken pictures with and without the lens and ca n't see any difference in the pictures even during the daylight where it 's supposed to mitigatae the bluish tinge . So , if it does nothing else but protect the lens from harm , it 's worth it just for that .	1
Tiffen makes some of the best filters . This one is no exception . It fits perfectly for the size indicated and produces crystal clear photos enhanced by what the filter says it will do . Excellent color comes through on all your pictures with this filter . I am VERY happy with this purchase !	1
covers and protects your lens , its good quality and does what it is supposed to . Great price compared to others !	1
Fast shipping ! ! ! Fits well , clean and clear and provides mild polarization . I was worried about it being too dark . Just what I wanted !	1
I purchased this filter for the sole reason of protecting an expensive lens . I can wipe dust and fingerprints off of it easily without worrying about scratching my lens.I use lens paper to clean the lens , and have never had issues with scratching .	1
I still shoot B & W film with my Nikon F cameras . Yellow along with green and red are standard filters for B & W analogue shooters . This will be used on my RB67 . The yellow is a good general purpose filter for B & W for darkening blue skies and for skin tones .	1
The Tiffen filter is quality made . And is really nice for doing beach shots where the sky or the water sometimes gets overexposed or blown out when trying to get the perfect mix of sky and water detail.Highly recommended .	1
This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he states that it performs exactly as advertised and as he expected to . It is a great addition to his hobby .	1
This Tiffen filter works as advertised . I use it for sunsets and sunrises and it adds a little more drama to the skys , also seems to have good clarity .	1
Well built filter that arrived on time . I was able to get better landscape results shooting in sunlight conditions . Inexpensive way to improve your outdoor photographs .	1
ND filters should be standard equipment for any serious photographer . Primarily I use ND filters for use in the blazing bright mountain snow ; the perfect solution without changing colors like a CPL filter can . I have been very please with all the Tiffen filters I have purchased and never hesitate to shop Tiffen first when I 'm in need of a new filter or a replacement . I know are bothered by the vignetting you can get from screw-on type ND filters but I have n't noticed this to be a problem as long as enough light is available . I fact , this filter is most useful when too much light is available . Until something happens to change my mind , I will tell everyone , `` You ca n't go wrong with Tiffen filters . ''	1
As usual , the product was delivered quickly and in good condition . However , I ordered a Tiffin 3-stop neutral density filter and that is how the box was labeled . However , the filter inside the case was actually a 2-stop filter . I 've decided this filter works for me , but I would have preferred the 3-stop filter . I do n't know who messed up here , Amazon or Tiffin , but these kinds of errors are unacceptable ! !	1
Good build , good enough optics , does what it 's made to do . Oh yeah , and since it 's Tiffen- it is cheap !	1
I did a lot of research on neutral density filters , and this one came highly recommended , without having to invest $ 50- $ 100 . A must for serious photographers .	1
Review of the Tiffen 77mm ND 0.6 FilterND filters reduce the amount of light entering your camera 's lens , slowing down your shutter speed and letting you blur backgrounds when shooting panning action shots . Instead I bought it in lieu of a polarizer to bring out the color in skies , because it has effects similar to polarizers with respect to fixing washed out skies , although it does n't offer some of the other features polarizers offer.Nevertheless , I brought this filter on my school trip to Spain for outside shooting ( it takes away 2 stops of light so it 's not recommended for indoor , night , or available light shooting ) on my Sigma 10-20 and Canon 40D , and the pictures it produced are absolutely breathtaking . Sure , part of it was due to Spain 's beautiful architecture , but the filter made the skies a deep blue and the buildings really stood out against the blue skies.I have n't done a lot of action shooting since I bought the filter , especially not on a 10-20 lens , so I ca n't comment on what effect this lens has on blurring backgrounds in action shots , but for my own purchases I was extremely pleased I bought this filter .	1
I take my camera to the beach for photographs . The filter acts as a barrier against mist being blown around in the humid atmosphere . I do n't worry about wiping this filter down nearly as much as I do the lens .	1
This is the second same filter of this brand that I 've purchased . These UV type filters are pretty basic and meant mainly to protect the actual lens . These do n't do much other than that . But , that 's why I purchased them for my daughter 's Olympus E-PL1 and a Nikon SLR that I own . As someone else mentioned , there 's a bit of flare . Strangely , I do n't notice it on the SLR . At any rate , it 's not enough to not recommend it.On the other hand , this Ensenda shipping company stinks . They marked the package delivered , yet it was n't . I suppose it 's good for their statistics . Not so good for customer service . Hopefully you 'll be lucky and get FedEx or UPS .	1
This filter is one of those things you ca n't leave behind when you 're using your camera . It protects the lenses against dust , fingerprints and even some bumps . I leave it on all times.It 's crystal clear to the camera . In my personal experience , I recently bought some cheap filters thinking I made a big deal but in the end , the camera would n't focus well . Then I bought this one , well I even hook the telephoto on it and still get great shots .	1
I like Tiffen filters . They 're metal and the glass is usually clear , well-polished , and without waves or distortions . I have on occasion received one or two in which the glass was not firmly mounted in the frame and there was a bit of wiggle . Nothing ever came of it so I just did n't worry about it . Just have to nick Tiffen 1 star for quality control . Filter glass should n't rattle around in filter frame . Period ... end of discussion on that one . I still buy Tiffen as their track record is on the winning side and they represent high value .	1
Learned quickly the value of Tiffen filters , both for protection of the lens element and for functionality . The Haze-1 filter adds something to color and light balance a simple UV filter does not . Continue to be very satisfied with Tiffen filters !	1
Have used these for years . Always high quality and durable for years to come . I can always recommend using Pioneer	1
I could not find these in the stores so again Amazon to the rescue . These came in perfect condition and just what my husband needed . Recommended if this is what you are looking for .	1
I bought this as a cheap way to protect myCanon EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS UD Standard Zoom Lens for Canon Digital SLR Cameras , and it does what its supposed to do . Fits securely and accepts the lens cap . I have not noticed any change in IQ .	1
A must have - I would suggest getting it for all your lenses . Typically they suggest it only for film cameras - for the way UV reacts with the film ( typically blue light ) . However , there are some other schools of thought that suggest not putting cheaper glass in front of expensive lenses.This does n't feel that way to me - suggest trying it out for yourself and check out the difference on many daytime photos .	1
It 's just a filter and i do n't know how i can made de review of this , i use just to protect my lens . The good is because i do n't notify any problem use that , my photos stay at the same quality using this filter .	1
I purchased this it 's good quality I putted on my lens canon 50mm f1.8 it fitted very well on it	1
Just get my lens protection filter from Tiffen , nice product very good for the price , I ordered one for my nikon 70-300mm , and 105mm and for my nikon 35mm..	1
This was pretty easy to install , just make sure that you are buying the correct size ( I needed a 52mm for my 55mm because it screws on the top ) . It does it 's job and protects my lens perfectly . I was very impressed with the price !	1
Excellent compatibility with my camera ( Sony NEX-5 ) . Ordered immediately when I purchased my camera but could n't find one in town ( did n't use the camera until I had this filter in place ) . Considering cost of camera lenses this UV protection filter is a great investment in protection . Easy to clean between photo shoots . I would buy another Tiffen filter when I purchase a telephoto or wide angle lens .	1
I bought this 77mm UV filter to help protect my Nikon Nikkor 18-300mm lens . Lens still takes great pictures with this filter on .	1
works nicely	1
Works very well with our Lumix as a protective filter . It makes us more comfortable when using the camera .	1
This is my second filter.My first one was on my 200mm Canon Lens . I opened my carrying case and found the lens cracked , looks like somehow it took a hard blow during my recent travel.So what can I say , I saved my $ 2000 lens for a $ 9 filter , works for me.I bought another one to replace my first one , I can do this all day long as long as it can save my lens ... .Buy it , I never thought I would crack one of these but clearly I was saved by the filter .	1
The filter is well made and without any defect and works well , as far as I can tell , without resorting to lab tests ! : )	1
Needed this filter for my camera . This Tiffen filter met my expectations and I highly recommend it . Verry , very nice !	1
This is just a good basic lens filter . I do n't like to leave any of my lenses exposed to anything so this to me is kind of like a screen protector . Pictures still come out clean and crisp from this . I just wipe it down with a lens cleaner when it looks like it needs it.Filter is sturdy and feels like good quality .	1
This could save you hundreds of dollars , or in the case of a point and shoot , the need to replace the entire camera .	1
I use this filter on my 1960s Japanese rangefinder camera . It fulfills all my UV filter needs for that model	1
Purchased this item along with Sony Sal 70-400 lens , it fits perfectly . and it was delivered on schedule .	1
This filter was ordered for my Nikon camera . I already had one on the camera however it came loose and I lost the filter somewhere on a cruise . This one fits perfectly and has provided the protection I needed . I normally only use filters to protect the lens .	1
For me this is as good as it needs to be , I can not find fault .	1
I use this filter as a permanent fixture on my lens . It fits great , is easy to clean , and does not interfere with my lens hood .	1
It 's a Tiffen filter , so you know it 's well made . Like the title says , every lens should have this basic filter !	1
I attached this lens to my camera and my camera did not explode . It fits . It is transparent.It appears to do the job it was intended for , which is to be unnoticeable.I have not attempted to damage my lens so I can not attest to its strength but I can confirm that it constitutes a physical barrier .	1
I just use these to protect the main lens from getting dirty or scratched . If this gets scratched , or bent from dropping it , I just throw it away and get another one . It is cheap lens insurance . Plus it helps seal the lens from rain .	1
These work pretty good on my 18-55mm is lens and my 55-250mm is lens . I 'd rather replace a scratched filter , than a scratched lens , and they have n't failed on focusing yet . Great clear pictures every time . Thanks Tiffen and Amazon .	1
I purchased enough of these to go on all my lenses . I see no distortion from the filters and they keep my glass safe !	1
I had purchased one filter with my new camera- $ 60 . It was an unnecessary expense , as Tiffen does the same job for a fraction of the cost . I 'm very happy with thi purchase	1
Works great , protects the lens and that is why I purchased it . Have not take to many photos so I could not comment on any hazing , shadows etc . But for me it is what I wanted .	1
I have some expensive B & W filters that are made of higher grade glass and cost more than three times this one . This one looks just as good ! Tiffen has my vote . I 'm going to save my money and buy these from now on !	1
I wanted a lens to protect my expensive Nikon larger lens . This worked great . Attached with no issue , screwed in easily and offers much needed protection for my lens .	1
If you have a DSLR camera , you really need this ! It doubles nicely as a lens protector in the event you happen to forget you lens cap ! I do n't know a whole lot about DSLR cameras , but I can tell you from a protection standpoint of the lens , it is 100 % worth it !	1
This is a great investment for protecting valuable camera lenses from scratches . It seals tight and keeps the dust and grit out . In my opinion , the UV protection is secondary to protecting the lens .	1
I use this mainly as a lense protector for my 50mm lens and it does the job very well . It does n't affect image quality at all .	1
this lens filter fit my nikon lense very well , i was very surprised on the delivery it came within a few days of ordering it ! i would recommend this company for it 's prompt service and delivery ! my old lens was bent and i could n't attachcertain adapters to it , now i can , i 'm very pleased ! rick~	1
Went into a camera shop and they were trying to sell me on a 60 $ filter that & # 34 ; does n't reflect back & # 34 ; , i have not noticed any odd reflections with this filter and it has already saved my lens once from possible damage ( with no damage to the actual filter ) .	1
I bought this just for protection of my Canon SX50 lens . I had to get a lens adaptor for this .	1
I have n't tested it a lot yet , but it fits perfectly well on my Panasonic Lumix FZ28 . The build quality looks fine to me , and the protection against finger prints is all I wanted .	1
This is my first Tiffen filter . I received it free as part of an Amazon promotion and I keep it on my Nikkor 55-200 lens . From the test shots I have taken with the filter on and off , I can see no change in my images or reduction in image quality with this filter , and that is what a UV protection filter should do . Also , it is extremely easy to clean , much more so than my multi-coated Hoya UV filter . Construction quality is excellent and I am quite pleased with this filter . If I were to purchase additional filters , I would definitely buy another Tiffen filter .	1
I have always used a UV or Haze filter on my camera lenses mainly to protect the front element of the lens . Tiffen products are top notch . I remommend then to anyone who uses cameras with interchangeable lenses .	1
If you 're looking for an inexpensive filter to protect your camera 's lens , this is a great choice ! I found that it scratched easier than I would like , but for the price this does not bother me .	1
Great add-on filter for use with the Canon EOS Rebel Digital Kit w/ 18-55mm lens . Offers protection for the lens and keeps out unwanted UV rays .	1
Just needed a simply protective filter for a lens -- nothing fancy . This filter works just fine , and at a fraction of the $ 50 that the camera shop was going to charge me .	1
There is not much to say here . It is what it is . I use it to protect my lens . It does it 's work . End of story .	1
I accidentally ordered the wrong size and returned this item -- no problem . I did inspect it thoroughly before ordering another size . It is a good value for the price .	1
Protects the front element of the lens . Easier to replace if inadvertently hit and much less costly then the actual front lens element.Also reduces the effect of UV on the photo .	1
All I wanted was a basic lens protector and this does the job well . The first filter I got from Amazon had a bubble near the perimeter , so I sent it back for a replacement . Not sure if this is an unusual miss or a ding on Tiffen 's quality . Replacement was fine . Amazon shipped the replacement the day I complained and paid for the return . Go amazon !	1
Buy one for every lens you own and never take it off ( except when it is scratched and you are putting the new one on . Cheap filter to protect an expensive lens , you never have to clean the lens and run the risk of scratches with this on because it keeps dust and fingers out . This takes a lot of stress off , for me at least , because with this on my lens , the filter will take the damage and it is cheap and replaceable .	1
Um ... it 's a UV filter ... and it fits 52mm lens ... um ... um ... and it 's clear and stuff ... Oh , and it 's very rigid ! Buy it !	1
Just a basic lens cover at a fair price . It 's a lot cheaper to scratch or damage this than the lens itself .	1
Wanted to get something at the same time as I bought my 50mm 1.4 on Amazon , this one was perfect , nice slim filter and works perfectly . Didnt need a $ 100 filter here .	1
It is just a must when you are putting it on a $ 2550 lens like the one i just bought to protect its glass . [ i bought the 28mm to 300mm IS canon ... ]	1
It is much better to break one of these than to break a lens . It works exactly as it should , you do n't know it 's there .	1
High quality at an affordable price . Inexpensive protection for a high price lens . No noticeable image degradation .	1
This is an inexpensive way to protect your 35mm or digital lenses . High quality , no distortion , and additional filters can be added to this one .	1
I tried series of test shots with the same vantage point with and without this filter and all the time I get the same or negligible difference in exposure between with and without photos . That means , amount of light eaten up by this filter is almost Nil . For $ 6 , this is a well investment I would say .	1
I bought the Pentax DA 50-300mm lens and at the time Amazon was running a deal of getting a free Tiffen UV filter with it . Normally I 'd go out a get a hight end filter but this was free so I went for it . It 's been a very good filter , have not noticed any significant difference between it and my much pricier Hoya . It has definitely exceeded my expectations . I 'd recommend this filter to anyone looking for a good quality inexpensive filter .	1
Like many others , I use UV filters mostly for lens protection . I have one on every lens I own and I simply replace them as they wear .	1
Tiffen 62mm . Well , it is a little silly to ask for a review on something like this . It fits the lenses , what else is needed to say ?	1
GREAT ! ! ! Works fine on my camera .	1
How can one review a filter like this one ? It 's just a very plain , simple filter ... that will not produce flare or make light bounce within the front element and the back of the filter . That alone merits mention : buy this filter for your lenses with a 77mm diameter front because it will do what it 's supposed to do .	1
Purchased this to protect the lens . Can not really say about how much UV filtering it does . No adverse effects noted and the front of the lens is clear and moisture free . This is a standard item to purchase for each lens in any photographers kit . With digital , there is n't as much of a problem with UV or excessive blue in a photo ( skylight filter fixed that ) as there is with film . This is a good product .	1
Seems to works well on my Pentax K01 40mm lens cap . Was not sure you could even get a filter at this size .	1
the price was right to protect the front element of your lenses , will protect me from any damage caused by accident , Sturdy build.never buy a lens without a UV filter to go over it. ! ! !	1
I mainly bought this lens filter as protection for my Nikkor 80-200mm lens . Works just as it should , no more no less .	1
I bought this filter for my new Tokina 2.8 wide angle lens . Fits perfectly and protects the lens . Great bargain . Packed well , shipped promptly . I can also use this filter on my Nikon 2.8 70-200mm lens . 77mm is hard to find in a store , so it 's great to have a few on hand in case you scratch or break one .	1
Fits perfect . i needed a replacement for a broken one and this fit the bill . Great item for the price .	1
This lens filter works as mentioned . For the price , you ca n't beat a better product to protect your lens and keep it clean .	1
I got this filter with my new lense and it fit my new 50MM F1.8 Canon lense perfectly . What more could anyone ask for ?	1
The Tiffen UV lens is a perfect addition to my lenses . I use this particular filter to protect my polarized lens as well as provide additional UV filtering . Most definitely worth the money I paid for it .	1
If you have any of the Nikon 1 mirrorless cameras with their new lenses , this is a must have . It protects the lens from dirt and scratches ,	1
Low price and does the job of protecting my lens and I leave it on all the time to protect against dust , scratching and breakage..	1
Bought this for my Nikon Nikkor 18-55 kit lens to protect it against dust , smudge , scratches etc ... ..and it does the job.The good : Easy to useCheap ( price ) Decent built qualityMade in USAThe bad : None so far	1
Exactly what is needed to protect the front element of any lens . Would never do photography with one of these .	1
This is my third Tiffen UV filter I 've bought and I they 've worked great , just put them on your lens and forget they are there , of course until that unlucky day arrives when you drop your lens and this filter will be there to save your precious investment ( the lens ) .Being an uncoated lens it does have some flare when pointed toward super bright sources of light . If you ca n't get the shot you wanted , just remove the lens momentarily or buy a coated filter .	1
I use the UV Protection filter to one keep the lens form getting scratched or dirty second the filter blocks ultra violet light from the sun that can cause flares and you get a clearer outdoor pictures with CCD 's they are very susceptible to ultra violet light unlike film CCD can pickup ultra Violet light have you ever seen night shot every one looks green and your eyes glow that 's the CCD picking up the Ultra violet light that is projected from the camera our eyes can not see it like infra red lay just out side our vision but a CCD can pick up Ultra Violet light so this filter blocks that light and can give you a better picture I have them on all my lenses . I like this filter it is well made and the results I get are excellent I have 6 of them they and all my work is very consistent .	1
I had used it for quite a while and I love this brand . I 'm not a professional but I 'm looking for quality products in my budget . This is one of them , love it ...	1
This is made in USA . Better than Japanese made HOYA filter in other camera lenses . I wish i knew better .	1
Not much to say in regards to this filter . It works as it was designed to do . I would recommend it to my friends .	1
Nice clear glass protection for my Canon EF 100mm Macro L series lens . Do n't risk using your lens without one .	1
I received this item and I am very happy with it	1
Got a couple of these to serve as lens protectors for Nikkor lenses . Not one of the classiest filters I 've owned - but it does the job I want it to do and at a very low price .	1
Another 'extra ' for our JVC HD Camcorder , I got this really only to help keep the camera lens cleaner . I liked the idea of the self closing lens cover but also felt that this filter in front of those covers would protect the lens even better ! I received it very fast and it fits perfectly on the camcorder . In bright outdoor shooting no issues . In some less bright locations I do feel that it made the auto focus less accurate and did take it off a few times then . Overall still a good expense , less than $ 10.00 , so I 'm glad I got it .	1
The filter does the job as advertised ; protects the front glass element of the lens . Being an uncoated filter , there was a slight amount of ghosting , but nothing serious .	1
I have several Tiffen filters & they work great . I always want to protect my lenses and these filters do a great job . The glass is durable & they fit right in the lens threads perfectly !	1
I bought the new Canon 60D and looking for Lense protector and UV filter.This is pefectly fitting my camera working great .	1
a good product at a good price , arriving in a reasonable time frame . I am very pleased with this item .	1
Very good uv filter to protect my very expensive canon long lenses . Tiffen is a staple for filters for a very long time . High quality at a low price . This will not disappoint .	1
The Filter not only protects from the UV rays ... but it also helps protect from scratches and everyday usage .	1
Purchased this filter ( ca3yrs ago ) for lens protection . During this time I 've noticed no physical , nor image distortion problems with the filter .	1
I like Tiffin equipment .	1
Works great for the price ! And I have n't noticed any distortion using it . Fit perfectly on my 40mm pancake canon lens .	1
It seems to provide the protection and filtering I desired so this product would seem to be doing the job !	1
It make no sense to purchase high quality lens and not protect them with a filter . I have this filter on all my lens and they work perfect to protect my quality lens .	1
for lens protection it 's great , i use it instead of lens cover , it 's cheap enough to replace a new one really often although it do n't need replace a new one often	1
I got this filter at a reduced price when I bought a lens . Excellent product . Better than excellent price !	1
I have 2 Hoya multi-coated UV0 filters , both of which are more expensive than this filter . That being said , I would recommend this little gem wholeheartedly . It 's a quality item for the price , if your budget does n't stretch to a high quality Hoya filter , or if the filter is there as lens protection . This particular filter attaches mainly to my 18-55mm kit lens.I have banged the front of my lenses on 2 occasions , and have decided that I like the idea of protecting the front glass of my lenses with a filter . I 'd rather break or scratch a filter than my lens , any day . One of those times I whacked the front of my camera hard enough to knock the filter off . Rather a $ 10 filter than a $ 200 lens.These work great , especially here in the harsh light , humidity , haze and dust of the Middle East . Get one , they 're a fantastic item , durable , slip easily on and off and wo n't interfere with your photos .	1
Nothing to technical about this product . The construction is precise and solid and unflawed Just what I expect from Tiffen .	1
This is a fine filter , it protects my glass nicely . Good quality and does the job . I would recommend it .	1
This filter is purchased for my micro lens . It fits perfectly . I have several Tiffen UV filters for various lens . They work well and serve the purpose .	1
It is just a piece of glass that protects your lens but I filters saved my expensive lens before and I can not image not having one on every lens .	1
OK , It 's a UV filter . I use it mainly as a piece of `` clear '' glass to protect the front element of a lens . What can you say about this one ? It is round . The mounting is solid and a nice black color with legible lettering . The threads are accurately cut and it easiy screws in and out without getting stuck or coming loose . The middle part is transparent so you can take pictures through it . It looks to be of a uniform density , with neither darker nor lighter areas . All in all , it is everything anyone could ever want in a UV filter . The single negative thing I saw was that it is inexpensive . If you get a charge of telling everyone how expensive your camera and ancillary equipment are , forget this filter .	1
Every serious camera buff needs to protect their lenses by placing a protective layer over the glass . UV filters give that protection without interfering with the sensor readings . Tiffen is a good filter maker ; reasonably priced , with quality products . I highly recommend all serious new photographers to invest in a UV filter to protect their lenses .	1
Fits beautifully onto my Canon15-135mm lens ... As good as any higher priced filters on the market.Never again will I pay camera shop prices again ... Shipped on time as stated would buy again from this manufacture ... .	1
It fit perfect on my Panasonic lumix fz35 and I have n't noticed much of a difference with the pictures I take . All I know is that it keeps my lens safe .	1
Functions as expected . T2i standard lense is operationally impacted when installed due to mechanical interference . Works good on telephoto lenses	1
You should have a filter on every lens you buy . Works just as expected . Protect your investment . This thing is great .	1
One should always purchase a protection filter when purchasing a new lens for your camera . At least that is what I taught in the photo classes I conducted .	1
Purchased thru Amazon the filter arrived on time in good order and the glass is good quality no flaws . UV filters are Lens Savers from getting scratches and chips . A necessity for any professionally used camera .	1
The filter was a good price and the one I received had no artifacts that appear in my photos . A good investment to protect your camera lens .	1
I use this filter for the Canon 50mm f/f.8 lens . It does n't add a lot of bulk to the lens while it keeps the front glass element and the top plastic rim of the lens from getting damaged . I know it 's a cheap lens , but the filter -- currently priced at 4.49 -- is very cheap insurance against accidental damaged to the lens . ( Note : This filter will also fit theCanon EF 40mm f/2.8 STM Lens . ) Now , the so-called UV protection is a marketing gimmick . UV protection is a throwback from the days of film SLR 's . Modern DSLR 's have a built-in UV filter . Therefore , the Tiffen UV filter does nothing in the way of improving the quality of your photos . In fact , in some situations , it may actually DEGRADE image quality because this filter is NOT multi-coasted ( like the higher qualityB+W version ) to reduce or eliminate flare.If you 're on a tight budget and do n't want to shell out the extra money for the B+W , this filter will work just fine -- as long as you 're not shooting into a direct light source , like a sunset or incandescent light -- which MAY cause light flare to appear in your photos. -- -For the price , this Tiffen filter is a good buy for those on a tight budget . Just be aware of the potential problem of flare when shooting into direct light .	1
What a great product ! I have been looking for one of these filters for my digital camera . It is a great find ! !	1
This lens is perfect for protecting your lens and blocking UV rays . What more can I say ? If you own a camera , you MUST get one of these and this is a solidly produced filter .	1
on time and as expected and they work great on time and as expected and they work great on time and as expected and they work great	1
It 's just a protection filter . It 's does a good work by day though it can create weird flares by night if you are trying to picture below a bright light or if there 's one pointing towards you.It also has a weird glass finish in the edges that make it look cheap ( even though it is )	1
This is permanently on my long lens , and is great . Good fit , does n't alter the speed of lens or distance ratio . Not much more I can say . order away an do n't lose but it does screw on well .	1
I was happy to receive the filter so that I could put it on my new Canon 75-300mm lens for protection in this winter weather	1
Not much to say about a basic neutral filter . Fit perfectly on my 50mm/ f.18 lens and so far , so good .	1
I use this on my Canon HD video camera . The kids are always bumping it around and touching the lens . This is a real must when you let your kids use your camera .	1
UV protection filter is really improved the DSLR photo result.The quality of filter is really good.I would recommend this product .	1
Hey people ! I bought 2 of them on eBay it was a little cheaper and no TAX ! So I got them pretty much to protect my lens from getting scratched , the build quality is great and it comes well packaged in a nice little case . I mean c'mon its under $ 10 , what do some people expect from this filter . I DO NOT notice any difference in my pictures , it 's just like having a clear protection glass in front of your lens . I would buy it again if this filter gives up it 's life protecting my NIKON lens .	1
Forget messing with the cheapies , junk . Forget messing with the real pricey stuff , do n't make no difference . Just find the right size and order it . End of story . Great value . Great performance.PS . I know some of you hot shots will take exception . Unless you 're better than Ansel Adams , hush yo mouth and do what I tell you . Besides , I got mind control on Amazon .	1
Buyt it to fit my pancake 1.7 20mm lens from Panasonic , fit well and size i can put the lens cap at top . Buy mainly to prevent dust and other material get to the lens surface , you shold do that first thing when you got the lens .	1
This is a quality optic . Shipping was lightning fast . Arrived on time and in new condition . I have already placed it on the lense , no abboration from the filter being hooked to the lense .	1
I have always protected my lenses with a UV filter . I 'm not sure that the filter actually does anything because of never shot without one , but I recommend spending a few dollars to protect an expensive investment . The Tiffen brand is always reliable .	1
It 's the little things that attract me as a customer . How was I treated when placing my order ? Was the person helping me knowledgeable about the product ? Did they make suggestions based on my needs ? Was the item received the same one I ordered ? Was it delivered to the correct address in a timely fashion ? I give a resounding yes in all these areas to my merchant . You 'll be hearing from me again .	1
excellent productsI love this product , its function meets 100 % and the attention was good , also the packaging that protects it very well .	1
Filter offers what I wanted - basic , economical lens protection for my camera . The threads were not as finely milled as I would have liked , but for the cost , it is OK .	1
UV Filters are good , protect the lens very well . I have been using for couple of years . Photos look good . Definitely recommend this !	1
This fits well on my lens , protects it against everyday hazards and cleans easily , but as with cheap filters it adds unwanted artefacts to my photos , even more so with long exposure shots . I would leave this on for everyday shooting but suggest taking it off ( or upgrading to better brands ) for more serious photography .	1
I 've been using it for some time , and , obviously , I have had no problems with it . So , it 's worth the price .	1
I totally love it , 49mm fits my NEX-5R perfectly . And it gives no dark corner when I use my camera.So I like it : )	1
This is just a great , simple product that will save you a lot of money - greatly reducing the chances you will damage the lens itself .	1
Just as the title says , inexpensive protection . If this gets broken , it 's only a couple bucks , if you drop and smash the lens , you 're out hundreds . It 's simple as that .	1
I put this Filter on my Sigma 18-250mm Macro Lens and it works just fine . The Lens Hook that came with the Sigma works with this too . However the other Hood I have does NOT work with this filter , it does not line up right and show up in some wide angle shots . I do n't know if its the filter or the hood , but since the factory hood works , I 'll be sending the extra hood back and keeping the filter .	1
Fits perfectly to all of my 58mm lens . Could n't ask for more . Pictures do come out much better , and I feel so much more secure knowing that my Canon lens are protected . Highly recommend this product .	1
This uv filter works fine- on my Sony a100 ! The Panasonic DMC 30FZ I bought it for on the accessories part of amazon recommended it and it is not the right size for that.I guess everyone but me knows to double check the small accessories that amazon says go with a unit . Taught me to be more careful , at least , when I 'm buying adapters , batteries , etc , have not had a problem since.By the way , it 's a good quality filter !	1
Not much to review here as everything went fantastic , the price was great and when push gets to shove , decent , name brand UV filters are all about the same . However , I was really shocked at how fast these came using standard shipping . I had them in a few days . Good work Tiffen ( sold by Tiffen through Amazon ) ! I also bought a polarizing filter the same day from Amazon using standard shipping and it took over a week to get here . So there you have a little comparison .	1
Stays on my lens and does what it is meant to do : protect the expensive glass.My images turn out clear and sharp.If you are n't using UV protection filters , you should be.Buy thyself a tiffen UV protection filter today . : - )	1
I bought the Canon T5i with the 18-135mm lens kit . This filter helps protect the lens from dust and scratches.Screws right onto the factory lens and does n't seem to cause any issues with performance at all .	1
Nice protective filter . I have had no issues with it . Definitely heips keep my pricey lens from scratches and dings .	1
Nice filter , just what I need to protect my old film lens . Price was right and it works very well .	1
Better have it to protect your lens . If you want clearer picture against sun , remove the filter . Other than such situation , no problem with it .	1
Do you want to replace your lens or just a filter . A must have .	1
Cheap and works , does not take any quality away from pictures , it is a little big though . You can not use this and another filter , or you will get some vignetting .	1
These are cheap enough to use as protection for your camera lens ! You should invest in one , it 's worth it !	1
You need a UV filter in front of your lens . Simple as that . Tiffen is quality .	1
Got this because my wife started using my camera and gave the lens a small bump . Screws on perfect and lens cover fits fine . I 'll get another of these when I get my 50mm f.2 lens as well	1
Product came pretty fast and it does the job . Its mainly a protection for my lens and the UV protection is minimal but the fit was great , construction of the lens is glass	1
Needed another article and this item added enough to make the shipping free . Well packaged and defect free .	1
I dropped my canon digital SLR T3i - yes - it happens ! And it fell on the lens ( obviously the heavier part - especially if you have a long zoom lens ... ) The only thing that broke was this $ 2 filter - I was so happy . I have one on each of my lenses now ... Enough said !	1
Great filter . Protects the lens from UV , dust , and debris . I have no noticed it to hinder picture quality at all .	1
This is a very fine lens filter , though not coated , for protecting your camera lens and for cutting UV haze . This 46mm ( thread size ) filter is well-made , well-packaged , and at a great price . Despite one reviewer 's report that it did n't fit the Lumix FMC FZ-28 , it actually does fit and fits perfectly well . It is perfect for the FZ-28 as it goes on the lens itself and not on the shell that goes around the lens . This leaves all the functions of the camera intact . One should always equip a good camera with a filter so that there is practically no chance of scratching the orginal lens . This one does it and at a very good price .	1
This is n't the first Tiffen filter I buy , and wo n't be the last . These filters have good build quality and not much flare ( at least not that I noticed ) . They told me when I first got into photography that I should always have a UV filter on my lenses , and these filters are great for that !	1
Actually , I bought it for a protection of my lens . I think it should be good and worthy to owning it for your expensive lens .	1
Great kit filter for the price . Pity that are not more filters tiffen with so good prices .	1
If you are an amateur photographer and you want to take some nice pictures at a small budget , these are some good filters	1
I have used Tiffen filters in still photography for a number of years now and I 've been very satisfiied with thier performance . This kit was offered at a much lower price than the leading on line camera stores.Plus they are made in the USA	1
I am an just an amateur photographer , and I have owned these filters for about a year . I have been very very happy with them , although I have to say that the circular polarizer is the only one that I use regularly . You can not believe how different your landscape pictures will look like with a circular polarizer filter unless you try it . This filter will really change your life ( well , picture-wise at least ... ) . If used properly , you will have pictures with incredibly neat colors . The way it will render the blue of a noon sky is unbelievable.I use these filters on my digital camera now , and the only minor drawback is that if you use the digital screen it is often hard to find the correct rotation for the polarizer filter . I mostly use the range-finder , though , and with that the filter is as easy to use as it was with my old film camera.overall , these filters are well worth their price . If you only want to buy one , you should definitely buy the circular polarizer .	1
I purchased this set after seaching high and low for the best deal . I was about to just go to my local photography store when , low and behold , I found these here at Amazon . You certainly ca n't complain about the price ! ! I priced JUST the UV-Haze filter at my local photo shop , and was rather suprised at the price ... JUST FOR IT ! ! When you considerd that you are ALSO getting a polarizing filter AND , the warming filter , that 's when this deal really hits home.So , if you 're in the market for a GREAT starter set of filters , I can highly reccomend this set .	1
With these filters you pretty much get what you pay for . They have good solid construction , and offer great protection for the lens . Threaded in front and hold caps pretty well too , which is a plus . But , once you start becoming more demanding of quality and move into more `` serious '' direction , the shortcomings would become more and more evident and very hard to compromise on . My main issue with these is glare they produce in extreme lighting conditions ( night photography or very bright light ) . Some vignetting ( although not terrible ) is also introduced . For these reasons I never stack them either.I feel that for kit lenses and less expensive ones they do an excellent job hence the 5 star rating with price-benefit ratio in mind . However , if you 're using professional glass or feel that photography is something that you will be sticking to for a while consider doing a bit of research before committing to these .	1
I needed a polarizer for the 40mm Canon pancake so I figure getting the 3 filters and the pouch would be a great deal . It turned out that the filter works very well , Does Not add any distortion to the pictures as well as the movies . It is worth the money and I would recommend it to anyone .	1
I 'd recommend this to any serious photographer . It allows you to control your environment more accurately . The filters are of high quality .	1
I bought it because it has 2 of the 3 filters I use mostly , Circular Polarizer & U.V . Protector , and the third filter is thrown in as a bonus along with a nice pouch to keep all three in.Best part is that it 's Tiffen , a well-recognized brand , and at a price that was far less than if I went to purchase them separately .	1
A great set at convenient price . I guess a more expensive product is better , but is good to start experimenting with these ones , they come into a folder that protect the lenses . The Polarizing is good , and the warming is sutil .	1
These are great filters and especially for the price ! I was looking for just one UV filter , and after stumbling upon this set which was not much more than the price of one filter , I bought it . These are great lenses . I especially like the polarizing filter , but all 3 are great.definitely a worthy buy !	1
I need filters for a new lens I purchased for my Canon EOS camera . These were perfect for my application.They came well packaged and arrived a little earlier than expected , which I really liked . Thanks to them .	1
Good bundle for starters but not sure if it will fit pros	1
The filters do the job as advertised ; protects the front glass element of the lens . Being uncoated filters , there was a slight amount of ghosting , but nothing serious . I like the pouch , too , as it provides more than adequite protection . Also , there are slots for two additional filters .	1
The Tiffen line of filters appear to be adequate for most circumstances where a filter may be used . Most of the time , I keep a filter on the lens for lens protection while at other times , such as neutral density and polarizing filters , they are needed for specific functionality . Most of the Tiffen line seem to work well for me .	1
I 'm not a pro but do some commercial work on the side . These filters have worked well without producing any detectable distortion . I can recommend this set .	1
Naturally these are n't professional quality filters , but for the price point they are a very good purchase . They are far better than dime store variety that you see offered in the package deals on various other sites . I 'm using them on my Panasonic FZ28 and I 've found them to be quite effective for their intended purposes . The glass is evenly ground and the colors uniform . They come in a nice case as well . I would label these as a `` best buy . ''	1
I 've been using these filters for about a month and they seem pretty solid and well built . By the way , i 'm o hobbyist photographer , so i 'm in no way using these for professional results.The UV filter is on permanently and i have n't experienced much discomfort from using it . One thing is it contributes to vignetting when i use a lens hood , but i guess ANY filter would . Simple fix is to put them on in different order ( just i do n't like to have the lens hood on permanently , and switching them on and off is not my idea of fun ) .The polarizing filter works well , and the warm filter i have n't used much as of yet . They come in a nice pouch , which i feel could be a tad smaller . But overall it was a good purchase .	1
You could easily spend $ 30-50 on just one of these filters . I 've been extremely happy with mine so far . I especially love the circular polarizer . Ever wonder how photographers get that brilliant blue sky with perfect white clouds ? Try that polarizer ( you do have to rotate the filter to get results , mind ) and see the difference !	1
This is a great set of filters . I only gave it 4 stars because the filters do not have protection in the container they come in . I would have thought they would each be in a plastic bag inside the container , but they were not . Other than that , the filters are great . Tiffen makes great filters .	1
Kodak makes great film , and 400 speed is the only way to go . You may thikn this is overkill , but consider that if you are taking pictures of kids , you need a slightly faster speed than 100 or 200 so your photos do not get blurred . With nearly all cameras these days , you can always adjust your speed down ( so if you have 400 film in the camera , you can set it for 100 ) .THe actual picture quality is very good , with grain structure great and holding well up if you blow it up to an 8 & quot ; x10 & quot ; print.Best part about this film is the price ... you just cant find this price in Wal-Mart	1
Not comparable to Ektar or the Portras . If the light is off or low , not so good . Rather low-contrast and unsaturated . However , when scanned and manipulated digitally ( I use LR ) the results can be quite beautiful . Very non-digital , sometimes lots of grain . Nobody seems to have developed a digital emulation of this snap-shot , retro look . The palette is sort of Martin Parr or William Eggleston . Absurdly inexpensive . Does not convert to B & W very well . Actually , I kind of prefer it to Portra 400 , which seems plasticish . Curious to see what happens if it 's pushed . Will try it soon .	1
The Tamron AF 28-80mm lens for Pentax SLR cameras is an inexpensive way to increase the zoom on you camera . It provides a very useful zoom range for general photography and relatively sharp pictures .	1
Got this lens fairly quickly . Takes great pictures and easy to us . Great for regular shots landscapes etc . Good quality all-around camera lens .	1
If you are an outdoor photographer , this filter is a must for your collection . The gradual grey allows you to get the correct exposure for the sky and land . For example , if you are shooting a sunset ( or sunrise ) it is easy to correctly expose the sky , living the bottom part of your picture underexposed and almost black . This filter will help in these situations by giving both parts of your picture the proper exposure.The filter itself comes in a protective , plastic case that is well secured . You could throw it in your camera bag and not worry about it accidentally opening.FYI - this filter is part of the Cokin P series , which are a bit bigger than their A series and designed for wider angle lenses . If you are n't sure what size lens you are going to be using the filter with it is probably a good idea to be safe and go with the P series . In any case , there is plenty of information on Cokin filters to be found around the web . One summary can be found at ...	1
I have used aftermarket ND filters that tinted the picture . For this reason I purchased the Cokin filter . I think I am going to love them .	1
already had the holder so just got an adapter to fit threads of my other lens.bought specifically for slowing waters with a long exposure.does get scatched if not careful and the carrying case is too fragile.until i get $ $ $ for glass one , this will do job of stilling running water quite nicely .	1
These have all the attributes you would expect from high quality Jewel Cases . They are sturdy and substantial enough to protect the CDs inside . The hinges and clasps work smoothly so the case snaps closed and stays closed , but does n't fight you when you want to open it . The center hub holds the CD securely so it does n't rattle around inside , but releases it easily when you want to take the CD out.I can , however , confirm the experience of some the other reviewers . I purchased two 25-packs ... and in each there was one damaged case . One had a 2-inch long crack in it 's face , but was still perfectly usable . The second had a broken hinge which would have made the case DOA but I was able to repair it with some Duco cement . My feeling is that they are inexpensive enough so that a 4 % damage rate is acceptable . ( By the way , the package comes enclosed in a cardboard sleeve and shrink-wrapped , so if you were to purchase these in a brick-and-mortar retail store , you could n't inspect them first as one reviewer has suggested . ) One other fact about Slim Jewel Cases bears mentioning . They do n't have spine labels ( the label on the edge of the case ) . You either have to shuffle through them when you 're looking for a particular CD , or do what I do and make your own spine label from a stick-on label cut to size with an Exacto knife and a straight edge . That way , you can store twice as many CDs in a regular CD storage rack.Buying your CDs in spindles and protecting them with these cases allows you to conserve both funds and space ! What 's not to love ?	1
One of the most inexpensive racks that I found for holding CDs and DVDs . It came undamaged and was put into instant use . I will buy again when the time comes .	1
Bought as part of a birthday gift for a friend . Tower looks nice and standard CD cases slide in and out smoothly .	1
Immeadiately after receiving this product I was taken aback by all that was included . I knew that from reading the stats , that this product had many features . Once opening the product and installing it into my system , I realized that the stats did n't come close to discribing the full features of this item . I was Amazed ! Easy to install ( even with Windows 2000 ... not a small feat ) , a nice design and easy to use menus make this card a & quot ; must have & quot ; for anyone wanting good sound on their computer .	1
I have had my G-1 for over a year now and absolutely LOVE it . It 's my first digital camera and has given me a new found love of photography . I 'm what you would classify a camera moron , but the G-1 makes the photos I take look fantastic . It 's simple enough to use for those who need point-and-shoot functionality while allowing for more advanced photographers to play with speed , aperature , white balance , exposure , etc . to achieve the desired effect . One of the greatest features of this camera is the battery life . I 'm reading reviews of other 3MP cameras and am blown away that they only offer 1-3 HOURS of battery life . The G-1 will allow me 1-3 FULL DAYS of moderate to heavy shooting before I have to recharge . UNBELIEVABLE ! ! My only complaint ( and it is a small one ) is that the body of the camera does not allow you to use interchangeable SLR lenses and filters , but hey . . .given everything else , it 's a flaw I 'm willing to overlook . It 's a little on the pricey side , but this is one of those cases where you get MORE than what you pay for.Summary of things I like : Takes great photosBattery life , battery life , battery lifeEase of useEasy to download photos to my computer with USB cableComes with Adobe Photoshop LE & Zoombrowser photo management softwareAV out to view photos on your TVMotion video capableDid I mention it takes GREAT photos and has a fantastic battery life ? Things I do n't like : Not SLR lens compatibleThe PhotoRecord photo layout software is a little quirkyI purchased the G-1 as an impulse buy while on vacation and have not regretted it one bit . It 's a great all around camera .	1
I bought the 250D lens to use with my Sony DSC-F717 and it is just wonderful . I can also use it with my Canon G3 because I bought a Canon LADC58B Conversion Lens Adapter ( which is required and is inexpensive ) .I had been hearing a lot of good things about this lens in digital photography forums and I have seen many wonderful examples of its use.I recommend this lens to anyone who wants to make their `` macro '' photography shine . Get one ! Just be clear that there is the 52mm and the 58mm and do n't be confused as to which one will fit your camera.Edit : Just a clarification : This one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' even though above ( on this page ) when you click the links `` See More Technical Details '' and `` See all Product Description '' it mentions `` 52mm '' . This is misleading and confusing . At the very very top of this page it says `` 58mm '' . Let me just assure you that this particular one 'is ' the `` 58mm '' and 'is not ' the `` 52mm '' .late edit ( Aug 04 , 06 ) : Well , it looks as if Amazon finally corrected that misleading info I mentioned just above in my clarification .	1
So far so good . The battery fits properly and seems to hold its charge , so i am happy with it	1
Is the D30 the very best digital camera available , no . Is it a very good camera for the price , yes . ( ... ) I paid about [ x ] for a D30 body , with the 1GB Microdrive+extra battery as free rebates from Canon . ( ... ) If you figure the rebate was worth about $ 500 , then I paid about [ x ] for the body. ( ... ) The bottom line seems to be the D30 makes images about as good as typical 35 MM color film ( I 'd bet not as good as Kodachrome though ) .I did find the camera took some getting used to . For example , washed out highlights sometimes get color fringes and unprocessed images look flat and quite unsharp . After learning about sharpening and contrast adjustment ( Photoshop unsharp mask & lt ; search web for `` D30 unsharp mask '' for details > ) , I 'm pretty pleased with the image quality . Being able to instantly get a image histogram moments after snapping a picture is a GREAT way to analyze the contrast range of a scene , and makes me now think how photography with a film camera was totally lacking in immediate feedback about picture quality.A few features are not so well documented ( if you read the manual enough times it 's in there ) , like if you activate mirror lock up , the self timer is 2 seconds instead of 10 , perfect for long tripod exposures . I also did n't immediatly realize how important the dial on the back was ( needed for white balance selection , exposure compensation , and manual mode control ) . Speaking of white balance , it 's GREAT to snap a picture of a neutral ( white ) surface ( I use a 18 % grey card ) , and instantly get the camera to adjust the color balance . Remember daylight and tungsten filters for film ? I suppose you can use fully automatic mode for quick pictures of UFO 's flying by , but think this is a camera more for people who LIKE to adjust things for best quality.The ONLY reservation I have is resolution being 3.25 megapixels . There are now 5-6 megapixel cameras , but they either cost a LOT more ( like the Canon D1 ... ) or else loose a lot of that SLR'ness . Like no TTL viewfinder on the Sony 707 ( ... ) , and no interchangable lenses on the Olympus E-20 ( at the same price or more as my effectiveprice on the D30 ) . I was very surprised to find that EVERYBODY rates the number of pixels based on all colors . A 3 megapixel digital camera has generally 1.5 megapixels of green sensors , 0.75 of read and blue . This means in a 3 Megapixel RGB image , 2/3 of the final data is made up from interpolation . In my book , that 's not REALLY 3 megapixels . Some higher end prosumer/pro video cameras have three sensors , one for each color , although these do cost more.Based on everything I know now ( a lot more ) I would still probably buy the D30 ... ( ... ) I ca n't think of ANY alternatives that give so much for the price .	1
I have been using my Canon D60 with BG-ED3 battery/grip extender to take aerial photos from Cessna 172 aircraft as my husband ( a licensed private pilot ) flies . In the close quarters of the Cessna 's front seat , the grip 's button placement is especially appreciated , making vertical shooting much less stressful on my wrist . Further , the grip adds just enough weight to the camera to make it feel more balanced and solid in my hand -- an important element for any photography , but particularly so when in the air with minor turbulence . Aesthetically , the grip matches the Canon D60 and D30 cameras perfectly , looking exactly like an extension of the camera body itself . Solid , well-manufactured -- built to last.The cost of the BG-ED3 battery grip seemed a little steep , compared to the Canon grip extender I used on my Canon EOS Rebel 2000 camera . However , if you 're looking to add significant battery life , some more surface area for gripping the camera and convenient button/control placement for vertical photographs ( portraits and other vertically-oriented subjects ) , this is a great buy !	1
The film is fine . Its ASA of 400 is a good speed for outdoor pics with little motion . An ASA of 200 is however preferable for those whose pictures will be taken mostly indoors . Those who want to freeze motion ( eg . sports ) will benefit from an ASA of 1000 . Portraiture should be done on slow , ASA 100 or lower ( if available ) film . Value within each speed should be calculated by exposures divided by roll price ; in general , the 40 exposure size is a better bargain than these 25s .	1
At first I was a bit skeptical of this player . The box has a somewhat cheap appearence , and does not do a good job of conveying the possibilities of this product.With 6GIG 's of space , connectivity to any PC using a USB port , and standard Battery or DC Adapter Voltage , you can use this thing anywhere , anytime , and for so many different things it just cant be beaten for the price . You can easily use it for its intended purpose of listening to MP3 music , but there are so many other things you can use it for , your imagination is really the only boundary.I have really enjoyed using it to listen to Audio Books on long road trips , Flights , and other times when it is nice to have some interesting company . I also use it to store video cd 's which I can play through my laptop . Pictures from my Digital Camera ( Canon G-1 ) often take up hundreds of megabytes , which is a pain to have to put on CD to transport elsewhere . I can load 340mb of Images off my Camera into my computer , drag the files onto my 6GIG jukebox using the regular windows explorer , and take the driver cd with me . Then when I get to my parents , friends , associates house or office , I simply load the usb driver on their system ( 30sec . ) plug the Archos into the USB port , and drag and drop my photos onto their system . It transfers about 1.5mb/sec , so it is very fast compared to & lt ; any > removable media out there , and almost as fast as most 5400 RPM hard drives.As for the unit itself , it is manufactured in a very utilitarian manner , with most effort put into durability and function . That being said , if you can look past the somewhat handmade appearence , you will learn that the unit really is quite solid , substantial , and durable . I use it in its pouch , in my fanny pack when I go ride my Suzuki DRZ400E OFF-ROAD on roads that make your body ache and it never skips a beat . The only thing I wish it had was remote controls . It is definitly a pain to have to stop , unzip fanny pack , unzip carrying pouch , push stop , then reverse the whole process before proceeding.The sound is good . I have read reviews from other people saying when they turn up the volume or the Bass/Treble it causes distortion and popping etc . I have approx 600 songs loaded on mine all recorded using Music Match at 128kb and I have no concerns about the sound at all , and have not experienced a single pop in the 3 weeks I have had it . I suspect it may have something to do with their recording , or transfer process . The key is to throw away the included headphones and buy a pair of quality Koss , or others . It makes all the difference in the world.The Batteries are a minor inconvenience . You cant use standard off the shelf 1.5v Alkaliines or you will void the warranty , so you must use the 1.2v 1500mAH batteries included with the unit ( even though they are AA size ) . Mine came with 4 batteries already installed and charged in the unit , and 4 more shrink wrapped , which I assume need to be charged , although I have never needed them . With a full 12 hour charge , I can play continuous music for about 5-8 hours . It depends heavily on how much you mess around changing directories , etc . I would be willing to bet you can charge these batteries externally using any number of standard battery chargers available , althought the manual makes no suggestions that I could find . Some people complain about the batteries being hard to get out , but I wonder why they are trying to take them out anyway . You charge them inside the unit with the supplied AC adapter . I took mine out just for fun and it was easy . Just take a small screw driver or other implement with similar shape and pry very lightly in the slot . Once you have it out about 2mm , simply push the whole battery cover up , away from the body of the unit . It slides right out with no hinderances that I could see.The layout of the controls is easy to figure out without using the manual which to me is important . Loading music onto it is also just as easy since Windows sees it as just another drive , and you drag and drop your stuff onto it just like any other drive . Use nested folders to organize your files . Once on the Archos Juke box , you can easily navigate through nested subdirectories by using the + key to scroll sideways , and the Play/Pause key to go up or down the directory structure.Over all I am very impressed with this unit . It has lived up to my expectations in every way , and I am a perfectionist . The only thing I would like to see is a USB interface that you could plug into it that would allow direct download of CF & Smart Media cards . That way you could bring it along with your Digi Cam , and download your 340mb of images at the end of every day without needing to haul your laptop around with you ! If you have specific questions , feel free to contact me .	1
I do love my Jukebox . My co-workers say that I must be a sales rep for Archos . Within hours of my having brought it in , the techno geeks from far and wide had found an excuse to swing by and take a look at the goods . Props were definitely received for being able to use it as a data storage unit . Once you get used to the idea of backing a HUGE data file off of your c : \ at work and schlepping it home while listening to your hottest tunes you 'll wonder how you ever did without it . I find myself looking at other mp3 players and thinking & quot ; how quaint -- what a sweet little music-only device & quot ; . And I smugly pat my Jukebox and feel superior . One thing - it can be a finnicky piece of machinery . Do n't try jogging with it or bumping it around much at all . You 'll regret it !	1
NOTICE : This review relates to TiVo , not this specific hardware device . I have a Sony SAT-T60 DirecTV/TiVo combination receiver.My wife and I became addicted to TiVo within 1 month after installing it . We have gone from watching 90 % live TV/10 % recorded ( VCR ) to 90 % Tivo/10 % live TV ! We hardly watch anything anymore at its regular time . We simply pull up the & quot ; Now Playing & quot ; menu , which lists all the shows I have previously recorded , and watch whatever we 're in the mood for - drama ( Law and Order or Once and Again ) , comedy ( Friends , South Park ) , reality TV ( Survivor , Fear Factor ) , or sports ( Illinois basketball , cliff diving ) .There are so many cool things about TiVo , but these are my THREE FAVORITE things:1 ) Season Pass , which once you set it up , allows you to record a particular show EVERY time it 's on or all shows with a particular actor or subject,2 ) Easy to record ( simply choose the show , not the time and channel ) and easy to find and play ( scroll through & quot ; Now Playing & quot ; list of prerecorded shows and choose & quot ; Select & quot ; to play ) ,3 ) Record two shows at once ( like Survivor and Friends , which both start at 8:00 on Thursday ) with a DirecTV/TiVo combination receiver , which we have.We started with the monthly subscription and moved to the lifetime after just a month ( it 's good for the life of the box , not you ) . We have a Sony model , and I 've found Sony to always be reliable ( two TVs , one VCR ) . I bought a 4-year warranty as a safety precaution ( new technology and insurance against the lifetime subscription ) . DirecTV customer service is decent , but not great ( they handle the TiVo side as well ) . The BEST resource for TiVo is the TiVo AVS forum , which you can link to from the Buzz section of the TiVo Web site . It 's a & quot ; must read & quot ; prior to buying this unit . But I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the coolest , most liberating invention to come out since the World Wide Web . No joke ! You will fall in love with your TiVo too.UPDATE ( 1/13/02 ) : I 've just discovered that DIRECTV/TiVo combination units rarely hold the number of hours suggested . Note that this unit advertises & quot ; up to 35-hour recording capacity. & quot ; In reality , the data density of the DIRECTV signal is variable and you will rarely have even 30 hours of capacity . I have been maxing out at around 25 hours before things get deleted involuntarily . You can control the recording quality on stand-alone units and therefore , you can tell exactly how much capacity you 're using . Recording quality is not an option with the combo units , but you should assume that you will NOT be able to retain more than 22 to 25 hours of programming before shows must be deleted in order to make room for new recordings . This does n't change my enthusiastic view on TiVo or the combo units one bit . But I might need a second one now ... ..	1
This is a nice gadget to have with your camera.It 's not that you will use it ... everyday , but the moment you need it , you will appreciate the money you have spend on it ... My only complain ( that 's why the 4 stars ) ... With my E-500 the zoom buttons does n't work ... although someone might as well say ... why do you need the zoom ? ? ? ... you set the camera before you walk into the picture ... you press the button ... you smile and you are set ... if you begin zooming ... then you might as well lose the the picture you wanted to frame at the beginning : DBeyond this small complain ... I will easily recommend it as an addition to all Olympus cameras ...	1
The RM-1 is very compact and easily storable in the smallest of places . I use it with my E-300 Evolt Digital SLR . With this camera only the large shutter button on the remote is usable . The other 4 buttons for zoom and +/- are not applicable to that particular camera . A bit of a disappointment after getting it , but I probably would n't have used them anyway .	1
this is a great accessory , I really like this for when wanting to take a self picture or for those awesome tripod shots .	1
What can I say ? You plug it in and it works . No issues whatsoever . Plug it in and it works .	1
I have a room in my house with no internet connection and no cable connection . With all the wireless cable boxes and tech that is out , most people would just be fine with wireless . I want a much faster connection between machines , so I figured I 'd run some wire through the attic and into that room . The run is about 55 feet . Instead of buying a kit for more money , I figured just buy this , and cut the ends off and splice in with keystones.I ran the cable without much issue , and cut it all to length . Once I spliced into keystones , tested connection with my Pyle network cable tester , and everything checked out.I plugged my network drive into it , and everything worked fine.Pros:1 . Cost2 . Nearly undetectable loss of packets over a 75ft run3 . Quality cable ( no issues splicing into keystone ) 4 . Nice to have network ports in the house , not relying on wifiCons : None	1
I am very glad that I went with the longer cable . This cable works great . IT does the job it is supposed to . I had to replace some older worn out old cables . If it were Cat 6 , I would have gave it 5 stars , but this cable does the best it could be .	1
For personal use , I only buy cables to go . They are a high quality cable and a great price . Their RJ-45 's are quality , I have n't had one break yet ! The cable also coils nicely , and hardly tangles if I am lazy and toss it in a pile.I ca n't recommend these enough !	1
I use these in the workplace for workstation connections and patch cables at the switch . They work well , plug in & unplug easily and seem fairly durable . We never re-use cables once used , so this has been an economical solution that performs .	1
high quality product ... .except 4 the sticky side on the back ... ..ive bought 2 of these and both had to be lightly glued ... .the lights are decently strong ... and evenly spaced ... obvious marks where u can cut it but i didnt need to ... .	1
I used this on my motorcycle , mounted under the Panniers ( saddlebags ) . They provide the perfect amount of light for my application . I would n't want the light over powering , but strong enough to be noticed.Worked great ... only on for a few days , but very happy with the product , especially at the price .	1
Even though its marked at pc133 bus it works fine in my pc66 machine . little bit of ram . a decent vid card can take your old pc a long way from feeling old . that and a lightweight Linux distro .	1
I wish these could have been gotten with free shipping , that cost was more than the product cost . Even with the shipping costs added , the price for this memory was lower than I could find elsewhere . I got the stick in the mail , well packaged inside a static free plastic sleeve , inside a bubblewrap ball . I looked at the contacts and could find no scratches- it looked to be new . I popped this onto my computer motherboard , cranked it up and I was going in seconds . My older computer actually uses PC100 memory , but the PC133 memory will work just fine ( but it will operate at the slower speed ) . I just finished installing a new OS , now my old computer is ready to go a few more years .	1
I was worried when i got this memory , because i ordered PC-100 memory , and it was clearly labeled as both PC-100 and PC-133 . I was n't sure if i would have a problem . But it installed and is working perfectly in the old machine , and has helped the old gal a lot !	1
very nice price might have to wait a little bit for them but it is cheaper than i was paying in our store	1
They 're envelopes . Paper and plastic . No glue/saliva tabs on the back . Just a notch of paper to tuck the lip in to . Does the job just fine .	1
We made a lot of cd 's of our old family videos to give to all our family members and needed a practical way to protect each one of them . These envelopes were the perfect answer .	1
After I had to pay a repair bill for a blown inverter on my refrigerator due to a power surge , I installed this for my refrigerator on the vertical outlet that was in the cabinet above the refrigerator.It seems pretty heavy duty and I like the diagnostic lights if I remember to check it once in a while .	1
This item was installed as a protection unit for my stereo system amplifier/receiver . I thought it would prevent damage from a lightning strike . As it happened , a company I hired to install a home generator , had a ground wire , as I understand from them , not correctly attached . I think it never was attached . At any rate , about 1 week after the install , there was a power failure , and the generator attempted to come on , and failed . Its attempt burned almost all fluorescent lights , and many other items , which would be to lengthy to describe here . This unit saved my very expensive receiver , and I intend to buy more of this brand . It is a small price to pay for such protection .	1
This Cables to Go USB to Parallel Printer Adapter Cable installed easily and worked perfectly with our shop 's old `` Zebra '' label printer . My wife loves the Zebra printer and was somewhat distraught when her old computer finally died and she realized that her replacement laptop did not have a parallel printer port . She did not want the new label printer I bought for her , she wanted her `` Zebra '' printer to work on the new computer , so somewhat skeptically I ordered this cable.Installing the cable was very straight forward and did not require any additional drivers to make it work on her Windows laptop . The included instructions made configuring the printer port very easy and I was able to have everything up and running in well under a half-hour.My wife is thrilled to have her favorite printer back up and running and I am happy that it was an easy ( and fairly inexpensive ) fix to the problem.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
no special drivers , this just plugged in to the new computer and it found the driver . result is that my old favorite printer is alive and well .	1
I just installed this adapter so that I could share an old ( non USB ) laser printer between my two networks . It could n't have been simpler . I just plugged it in ! Software was automatically downloaded/installed . I was able to start printing in about 2 minutes.It 's great when products work the way they are supposed to ...	1
I 'm enjoying the use of my HP Laserjet 1100 again . Does n't come with any Mac install instructions so here 's what I did:1. connected laptop to printer using USB adapter2 . turned printer on3 . used system preferences to add my printer ( not the cablestogo adapter ) . Add printer utility saw the printer right away . Despite what it says in the instructions for Windoes , no drivers were necessary to use the cable adapter with OS X Snow Leopard.4 . started printing5 . wrote this review	1
Win7 automatically recognized driver , no issue . Got HP plotter working with AutoCAD running XP mode in less than ten minutes .	1
After reading of installations glitches experienced by other users I thought there was a possibiliy of problems . I have an old HP Laserjet ( 1st year they made it ) and a new Dell machine w/ 64 bit Win Vista . There is no installation CD and none was needed . I used the printer set-up instructions in windows and set the printer to print to the virtual USB driver instead of LPT1 . The instructions indicated that there are downloadable drivers for Win ME and Win 98 on their website . My printing experience has so far been compatible to the parallel interface I had on an older machine .	1
I ordered this along with the Cable Flash FL-CB05 for my Olympus E-410 camera . No problems , works very well , easy to assemble , no problems .	1
it works ... what else can you expect from a T cable connector.The screen appearance did not appear to be effected .	1
Works fine right out of the box . Feels well made . No problems with use so far . Tough to beat at this price .	1
Normal good quality . Keeps cabling tidy when the computer is right by the power strip.I end up buying short versions of a lot of cables , for my desk and my living room game/theater setup .	1
I was looking to find a longer cable so I would n't have to use a long extension cord . This is just what I needed . They do come in longer lengths , also . This cord fits my amplifiers and monitors perfectly . Non have failed and I feel they will last and last .	1
Great power cord , It work well I am recommending you to purchase this product it well last a long time	1
I used this so I could run it and a long HDMI cable through the same conduit to my video projector . Nothing special - but it does the job . Our local home-repair stores do n't carry a cable this length in stock .	1
I bought it for work to go with a work TV that was missing a cord , it works great the sizing chart was a perfect match .	1
No problems . Works great and as I would expect . Glad I got it . Would recommend it to anyone who needs this .	1
I tried this cord on several different devices . I bought mine after losing the cord to a monitor after moving . I was skeptical because of the different shapes of several plugs but it really is universal.If this review was helpful please add your vote . Thanks .	1
I used this to replace a too short power cord for a projector . Works great , serves the purpose , and have had no issues . If used for a projector be sure to check that the part that goes into the projector is compatible , as some projectors have proprietary connections .	1
This is a good power cord that is useful for hooking up a computer to a power outlet that is 12 feet away .	1
A high quality cable at a great price.I bought these for use with some of my Roland gear.Works perfect .	1
We used it to mount Projector on Celling and needed a long cable as oppose to running multiple connected cables or getting an electrician ti come and install internal wiring and drilling holes this held us run cable to the length we wanted and used Legrand C210 Cord Mate II Kit to hid the cables	1
C2G / Cables to Go 03130 18 AWG Universal Power Cord IEC320C13 to NEMA ... according to technical specificationspromptly providedworks very welleasy to usewell executed and finished	1
It works ... has met my needs , bought primarily due to length , color and need to meet certain connection end points , as equipment I had was missing a power cord .	1
The cable works very well , thanks ! It came on time and it fits perfectly my power unit . It deserves a 5-star rating .	1
IEC cables are ubiquitous these days - they are used on all kinds of computer and consumer electronics equipment . If you use the supplied cables , which are usually six foot long , for all your wiring , it will lead to a nightmare of cable clutter.The solution : buy short IEC/AC cables of various lengths , and use a cable just as long as you need ... 1 foot , 2 foot , 3 foot . The only way they could improve is by having them in length increments of every half foot up to about four feet.These are quality cables and are great for reducing cable clutter .	1
I purchased 2 of these to use on TVs I mounted at work as the outlets werent close enough for the standard length power cables and extension cords or power strips werent an option . These seems like good quality cables for the price and serve their purpose . Good purchase !	1
It works ! It works so well . Fit my old Dell monitor just fine . Provides electricity like a champion . Fits into the outlet .	1
Works great as advertised . Using this to power a 26 inch monitor with no problems . Cord stays nice and cool so I ordered a 2nd one for another project .	1
this cable performs like any standard power cable . it is capable of handling any amperage of any device that I have in my home with a compatible connection . currently have a 47 & # 34 ; TV plugged into cord . No issues	1
This power cord was exactly what I needed . I purchased it to replace one that had split and this one was a perfect match . It arrived quickly and it works perfectly . The cable was the same quality as the ones that you receive when you purchase something new .	1
These are sleeks and elegant cases for your dvds and cds , with a reputable company brand that you can trust . The only downside is that only comes in a 10-pack .	1
The product is exceptional . I upgraded my PC and Windows XP Operating System plus Microsoft Office 2003 to Windows 7 and Office 2010 to solve an Excel crash problem caused by exceeding & # 34 ; Excel 's Format Limit & # 34 ; ; however , computers no longer have a & # 34 ; Parallel Input/output Connection & # 34 ; , only USB 1 , 2 , & 3 plus others but no & # 34 ; Parallel Port & # 34 ; . Windows 7 does not include a & # 34 ; Driver & # 34 ; for using a USB 2.0 to IEEE-1284 Parallel Printer Adapter Cable ; nor does HP provide such a & # 34 ; Driver & # 34 ; . I have been using this product ( and the included & # 34 ; Driver & # 34 ; ) for months now and it works flawlessly . Read the instructions included on the CD to learn how to install both the & # 34 ; Cable & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Driver & # 34 ; correctly . There is a & # 34 ; Specific Sequence & # 34 ; for & # 34 ; Installing the Cable & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Turning the Parallel Port Device ON & # 34 ; , and & # 34 ; Installing the Driver & # 34 ; . This product includes multiple & # 34 ; Drivers & # 34 ; for different applications ; so read the instructions and your & # 34 ; Parallel Port Device & # 34 ; will work again with Windows 7 . If you need this for Windows 8 then call the manufacturer to confirm if they have a & # 34 ; Down-Loadable Driver for Windows 8 & # 34 ; given you purchase this cable and included & # 34 ; Drivers & # 34 ; .	1
Ordered this 2 foot and a 3 foot for a pair of workbenches and they look and work great . Nice silver finish .	1
well-built , easy to mount , aesthetically it blends well with the wall color without looking intrusive . I have owned it for over a month and seems to forget about it as it quickly become a natural part of the study room .	1
It 's just what I needed to add some outlets to my HT cabinet.The reason its 4 vs 5 stars is the cord . Coming out the top is not a real issue for me , but for putting this in a cabinet or something similar ... the cord is way too long and way too stiff.I just cable tied the excess cord ( about 90 % of it was excess ) and attached it to the top of the back cabinet wall.I do like the covered switch and the spacing between outlets . All in all a nice solid unit .	1
I use so many different cables and connectors that I never seem to have the correct gender cable and this solves many problems . It works well .	1
got too many DB-9 females in your life ? Need a dude ? This will do the trick . Worked and was cheap .	1
I got this charger set bundled with my Olympus Digital Camera last year . I had a Ni-MH charger set already ( which I spent a lot on ) , and assumed that when I got this , I 'd pull out the batteries and leave the charger in the box . But then one day I wanted to charge 2 new sets of batteries before leaving on a trip , and was astounded to see the Olympus charger was complete hours before.Now I only use the Olympus . It works with all my Ni-MH batteries , and charges them up quickly . It does n't get hot while working , so I am not afraid to stick in the batteries and leave it be . A few hours later , the batteries are ready . It 's so convenient.Compared to the other charger I bought , this one is nicely priced . However , I bought that a while back so I do n't know what the prices are like now . However , I can vow for the quality of this , so far.If you are trapped by an AC cord , or using regular alkaline batteries and having to throw them out after one hour , this will set you free . I ca n't tell you how much having rechargable batteries changed my digital camera use .	1
Strongly recommended . Great battery life and the charger works with other Ni-MH rechargeables . Worth the price .	1
Be aware that the A/B does not mean the more familiar Type A/Mini-B connectors . This cable 's 'B ' end is the full size , square 'Type B ' a few USB-connected peripherals may require.I thought I would use one of these with my new 'white ' Asus to connect it with an external drive but , in the end , I returned the Asus and now I 'm stuck with the cable : ) To conclude : it 's good as a color-coordinated cable to work with or between 2 white devices of which one accepts a full-size Type B connector and for which a white USB cable was n't supplied in the first place.The price is right if combined with Amazon 's free shipping on $ 25+ bundles .	1
Cable was true white as desired to match my other mac cables.It is an average quality USB cable and does the job adequately .	1
I bought this cable as we somehow misplaced the one we had . Came in two days , fits fine , performs flawlessly . Not a big believer in premium cables , I 've had no problems ordering all my cables off Amazon .	1
Now , probably , for the first time in your life , you get to choose the length of your printer cable ! Yes , that is right . In 1 to 3 meter formats or longer if needed , in black or white , in USB2 , speed , you get to choose at Amazon low prices at fast deliver speeds . Prime is available.Mine arrived in 2 days .	1
This cable is the right price and gets the job done . Highly recommnded if you need a long USB cable .	1
this is just what I wanted . It is long enough to reach the tower & the printer . I was n't sure about the leight but it is just want I wanted . very pleased with it .	1
This power strip was just what I needed to get rid of a tangled nest of power cords . It is clearly build solid , and has a nice LONG power cord . The outlets are space wide , so you can put a power-cube in each one , if you need.Warning - It does not have surge suppression .	1
Unlike many power strips that I 've had around my computer , this one can actually use all of it 's plugs because they are spaced out far enough to fit in the awkward sized ends . It does take up considerable space , but if you 've got room under your desk , I highly recommend it as cords tend to be less tangled and easier to manage .	1
fit perfectly onto my pegboard for my workbench with the included clips that allow you to screw them in - with a nut/bolt combo or with a wood screw into a solid surface - and then clip the power strip into the clips . definitely recommend buying this power strip ! ! !	1
Great power strip . Not quite wide enough for the oversized wall warts that power our electric pianos . But still an excellent strip .	1
Works just as described . Heavy duty for use in the Garage . No problems so far . Best feature is long lead on power cord .	1
I am still waiting to give it a good test . I am still refurbishing my old HP Deskjet 1120C but I will be ready	1
This cable does exactly what you 'd expect it to do . It extends your DB25 connection 10 feet . Nice quality construction too .	1
EMI and RFI filter banks like none other . Monitoring LEDs . Metal frame.The rest of the surge supression industry trembles at the word & # 34 ; ISOBAR & # 34 ; .	1
Very good power strip . Good quality at a low price . The only cheap part of it is the power switch , but I am not worried about it since it will not be flipped on and off much .	1
Connected to a clothes washer based solely on the fact the wash machine manufacture does NOT warrant againt power surges . This applies to any extended warranties . Tripp-Lite will cover any appliance connected to this surge protector ; the best low cost insurance you can get . The unit is built like a tank . It has mounting brackets so it can be mounted to a wall so it is not laying on the floor . Highly recommended .	1
works , as described , and is very sturdy . I 've had items with cheap clips or flimsy connections - this is not one of those .	1
It is becoming more difficult to find standard , yet high quality floppy discs for those of us who still use them for one thing or another . These are good , high quality , well made discs , and I haven ; t had one go out yet . Price is more than fair as well .	1
Floppy disks who needs them anymore ? ? ? ? ? ? ? well I do ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! .I have a lot of data that works on older style music sequencer which still works well and every weekend I depend on these disks loading up midi files to play with live music . Run of the mill Staple or Best Buy brand floppy 's break , lose data etc , these seem to hang in their and give me confidence I need that wont quit on me . If your in a situation like me trust me they hold up .	1
First , let me point out the bad : It 's labelled as a `` lapel '' microphone , yet the clip hardly fits most shirts . The bit that the microphone is supposed to sit in while not in use or to hook to a monitor does n't stick to objects very well . The cord is n't well shielded at all against electronic interference.Other than that , it 's a great microphone , provided the intended audio to be recorded is voice . ( Do n't expect it to do too well for music ! ) The resulting quality is spectacular for such a cheap device , though you need to make absolutely certain the cord is n't touching any power cables or anything that carries a charge , lest your audio be plagued with buzz . Using the noise reduction function of an audio editing program may be desired if the only audio in a recording is a voice clip from this microphone , as it is n't without its own ambient noise .	1
Purchased this Surge Protector for additional computer appliances , I own already 3 Tripp Lite Surge Protectors and they have proofed to be the perfect protection . I like about them that they are built in a robust metal housing , have a flat wall plug ( so they fit perfectly behind furniture ) and Tripp Lite gives you lifetime warranty/replacement - I went through it and their service is exceptional , read below if you want to know more.I had a very nasty experience a month ago when the transformer for our apartment building blew up ... there was a short spike in the power supply which roasted most large kitchen appliances and a few other things in my home . Luckily I had installed Tripp Lite Surge Protectors for my TV set as well as for all my computer peripherals - the Surge Protectors took the hit and protected all things behind them.Now the best thing and why I would always go again with Tripp Lite ; After the incident I called Tripp Lite to find out if I can reset the surge protectors , they told me at the phone that the spike must have been to much and that I need new ones . At that moment I already was thinking to go and shop , but they actually asked me for my address , the serial number of the surge protectors and hey 3 days later I had brand new replacements in the mail ! ! ! That is the customer service we all love !	1
I 'm gon na buy more . It arrived on time and in brand new condition , just as advertised . Easy to install and has performed well since .	1
I can only imagine this suppressor is doing its job - how could I really be sure ? Anyway , this one has an excellent 12 ' cord with side-mount plug and feels solidly constructed in a metal case that will probably contain any fire-related issues during a surge ( as opposed to those plastic units , which I 've seen pictures of all burned up ) . The outlets have a fair amount of spacing between them , maybe not enough to plug in 8 wall-warts , but probably could get 4 of them on the outer corners and then regular plugs on the inner 4 . The ONLY negative I could give this , for which I gave a 4-star rather than 5-star rating , is that when devices plugged into this are ON it seems to emit a buzzing noise . At first I thought it was coming from my speakers , but I tracked it down to this suppressor . It was loud enough to hear when there was no audio playing , but not enough to hear when audio is actually playing , so not a big negative but it would help to make sure this is buried behind speakers / cabinets / other equipment to help muffle that buzzing sound . It *could* be that only my unit that does this , I only have one so nothing to compare against .	1
Well built , heavy duty construction . High level of guaranteed surge protection . I use with my guitar/bass amplifiers . I 'll probably purchase the four-outlet version as well .	1
Noticeable improvement from my old PC surge protector . My speakers no longer `` pop '' when I flip a wall switch for a light/fan on the same circuit . Close lightening strikes used to generate a loud speaker pop and trip the safety circuit on my speakers ; now lightening creates a soft `` pomp '' sound from my speakers which is n't loud enough to be startling or concerning . I love the long cord , particularly useful in older houses with limited wall outlets , and the eight outlets are spaced well enough for most plugs and small power bricks , although a big power brick might block another outlet .	1
these are the surge protectors that the company for which i work purchases for use on the job . recommended by engineers so i got ta go with it to protect my electronics at home !	1
I have another but decided to get more to accomodate my extensive electronic collection and to better protect them ( very important ) . I went to best buy once to get one and the look on the girls face was one of & # 34 ; what are you talking about & # 34 ; . I do n't shop there normally , but I thought I 'd try to see if they had one . Not even the manager knew what it was , I had to tell them . This product will do the job very well !	1
Industrial build quality . Heavy duty , solid components . See all the reviews and analysis of the internal filter stages and protection , basically this ca n't be beat for anything in the same order of magnitude of price . Easily worth $ 100+ , available for almost half that. Can not go wrong . Lifetime warranty . Each pair of 5-15 's are in their own filter bank.Seriously . Buy it .	1
These things are great ! I 've bought three of them , and when I need more this will be what I get again . It 's quite heavy and completely solid . If desired , this unit could be used to smash and destroy lesser power strips that are made of cheap plastic.The real reason I bought this initially is for the high joules rating for surge protection . That is the metric that determines how much protection it actually gives you . This one does a much better job of protecting your equipment than many other units . Make sure and check how many joules of protection a surge suppressor offers before you decide on a unit.It 's just a power strip after all , but this has the feel of professional equipment . Tripp Lite also makes products that are used in internet data centers and hospitals , and this unit feels about as solid as anything you would find there .	1
Expensive , but I use one of these to power my HTPC , DAW , as well as powered Yamaha HS80M 's ... doing a great job ! If it was n't so dang expensive I 'd buy a bunch more and replace all my surge suppressors , including the ones that are like 50 years old with flickering neon lights suggesting they may not be in peak shape ...	1
Only issue I have had with this protector is that it kicked out with a space heater plugged into it.other than that it has worked great , and I keep all my major electronics plugged into it , and it has done fine.It is pretty beefy and well made .that and the reputation of the company were my deciding factors in the purchase of this item.I gave it 4 stars because of the issues with plugging a space heater into it .	1
I purchased this for the electronics in my home theater system . After using the product for several months through every type of weather imaginable , with the exception of snow storms , I am very impressed . Earlier this summer lightning struck the house next door and I had damage to my house from the surge of the power from the lightning ( the switch for my ceiling fans burned out and holes were burned through my steel roof ) - however , my flat screen wall-mounted tv , receivers , subs , in-wall wired sound system and laptop computer , which were plugged into my ISOBAR8ULTRA sustained no damage ... how fortunate I was to have purchased a quality product .	1
it 's nice , it works well , it 's built like a tank , it has a cord length that 's longer than I expected ... it 's a Tripp Lite { 8^D	1
We changed all our electrical products to Tripp lite , I think I see the difference , we had to ground an outlet in the bedroom to allow the isobar to function properly , I feel protected and get a clearer signal .	1
I have already reviewed this item and given it 5 stars . I recently got a chance to put my money where my mouth is again . An old plastic surge protector I had failed and I bought another one of these heavy duty metal babies . So much superior . Well worth the extra cost .	1
This is by far the best ISO on the market . I have this unit supporting my well water system since it was a hefty investment and i have others supporting network equipment . Never had one issue with any of my ISO 's and this comes from someone who has used Tripp Lite equipment over 10 years now !	1
This is the standard electronic cable release for the E-3 body ( as well as some older models ) . It attaches very securely to the dedicated socket on the side of the E-3 body . Like the old fashioned style , it features a lock mechanism for bulb exposures . Otherwise , it is a duplicate of the on-camera shutter button.My main gripe with this well built device is the length of the cable : too long . The whole thing is some 50 inches ! To took mine apart and shortened the cable to a more manageable 12 inches or so . This is not for the faint of heart , as the moulded stress reliever end is bonded to the wire . After cutting it to length , I drilled down through the stress reliever and then pushed the wire back through it . This , of course , requires opening up the body of the remote and doing some soldering . But it works fine ! I am happy to finally have an Olympus body with a wired remote , even if the RM-CB1 is a tad long ...	1
The RM-CB1 is used on multiple Olympus cameras . I 'll break the review into a tecnical review first and a fun stuff section you can omit . DSLR cameras have some unique advantages in the scientific and research fields which the RM-CB1 opens up to you such as bulb exposures without vibration , long term sequenced shooting , multiple camera syncing , and event syncronized timing . Lab geeks will have a blast.Technical summary : The RM-CB1 is relatively simple - a copy of the shutter release on your camera , plus a mechanical lock that holds it down for bulb exposures ( on a tripod ) , a one meter high quality cable , and a 3 pin screw-down plug for the camera . The jack/plug are nonstandard so you wo n't find them at the local electronics store , however , the back of the handle can be removed with one screw , and you can solder wires there where the cable comes in to attach your own trigger systems ( I have one that captures lightning strike photos - the camera is preset , the shutter button is halfway pressed with a toggle switch , and when the moment arrives , my preset manual exposure and infinity focus settings are used to capture the event ) How it works : There are two stranded wires in the cable plus a shield for a total of 3 conductors . The brown conductor is the `` half press '' equivalent when connected to the ground / shield . After this has happened , the camera will focus , so I put a toggle switch on it to hold the camera ready for the shot ( have dual batteries or an AC adapter if you plan to wait a long time ) . Connecting the red lead to ground takes the exposure.Depending on the model , you can take multiple exposures by multiple closures between red and ground without opening the brown to ground circuit - you need to test the `` half press '' logic in your camera.CAUTIONS / MISC applicationsAfter the E300 the remote cable release became a usb device and has a different part number . I do n't own one of these backs because I did n't know how the USB version worked , but my friends do and have engineered similar interfaces , so you 're not left out in the cold if that 's what you have.As of the olympus E3 they switched back to the RM-CB1 plug again , which was one of the reasons I bought an E3.Making your own exposure control means you need to know the various delays - I use an Agilent frequency counter that can be set to count 1/10,000,000ths of a second from start to stop ( one ten millionth of a second - way more than you need ) . Do n't pay attention to more than the first 1000 's of a second thogh - there are delays in relays between two poles when you run a clock that fast and the camera will vary depending on its temperature . The E300 has different delays depending on what you want it to do - if you PRESET exposure , focus , and just trigger it you can expose it in under 0.09 seconds ( 9/100 's or 90/1000 's of a second ) on an E300 which is fast enough for lightning . I use a fast shutter speed and photograph the agilent timer to see when the exposure was taken.E300 's go for $ 187 now on ebay so you can buy several and use sequential timers between them for mini-high-speed photography . If you know when an event will happen - you start the first camera at -0.090 seconds on the first timer ( omron makes these and can be found at grainger 's industrial section ) - timer output two is triggered by the first then fires the second camera at +0.020 seconds while timer three and camera three fire at +.040 seconds giving you 3 exposures only 2 hundredths of a second apart which can capture rapid motion inexpensively . Most of the hardware can be found on ebay to wire this up except the RM-CB1 ! The omron timers can be accurate down to 1/1000 second.The Bullet and the Apple - can you shoot that ? In theory , yes . If your camera takes .094 seconds from the red circuit closing until it opens the shutter , then you need to know how far behind the apple to put a detector for the bullet about .1 second before it hits the apple and use it to trigger the camera ( do n't forget the time needed to detect the bullet ) . I have n't done this but I 'd recommend very slow bullets or else long ranges to shoot ! You could even condense this somewhat because it takes time for a gun to fire from the time the hammer falls which is to your advantage and another way to accomplish this . Moving the apple gives you some help too . Other options are a nightime bulb exposure and just syncing a flash on the apple based on how fast it fires which can be measured again with an Agilent frequency counter.The RM-CM1 is your entry into electronic , time lapse , high speed , automatic exposure , astronomic shots and a whole lot of fun beyond `` normal '' picture taking . Because I use my E300 's in a lab I 've done alot with this part . I like the fact that olympus cameras can be acquired inexpensively and take 8MP+ scientific photos under $ 1000 and still be used for `` normal '' portraits or bulb photos stabilized on a tripod with the remote release.Fortunately the digital format gives you the result immediately and you can adjust if you just miss a shot to get it the next time . Be sure to bring a bushel of apples !	1
I work in a computer lab for a community center , and that means that they have a lot of old computers with Ethernets that do not work so you have to replace them.. most of the time the replacements are meant for a much better computer than these are and the adapter is too large and I have had to cut them down myself ... imagine my surprise when I get these and see that inside of the box there is an attachment that you can use to change the size of the adapter for the older computers ... as I said , '' its about time '' . well done , and it goes without saying that it is much faster that what was inside of the computer anyway ... . thank you	1
A power surge killed the onboard LAN in one of our office computers , and this network card remedied the situation . Put it in the slot , plugged it in , and everything is back to normal .	1
THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW ( all negativity ends to be a positive ending ) , I give it 5 stars ! I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics , including my desktops network card , which is built into the motherboard . When I found out it was n't working , I went searching on Amazon for a new one ( since Amazons merchandise is always on sale , or just plain cheap , money wise ) and found this . I kept a tab on this open and looked at other , but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was , and the good reviews , AND a similar story to mine someone else said ( lightning storm , built into modem , etc . ) When I purchased it , I completely forgot about it until it arrived today . I soon hooked it up , excited and all . As soon as I power it on , I got that Limited but No Connectivity . I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it , over an hour and a half . Nothing . I went out and came back and still nothing . So I looked up online problems that could relate to this . After about 3 websites , I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix , after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it , it worked . And now I 'm sooooo happy , enough to get back on here , and write a review.I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled , took with them . I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue.TAHNKS STARTECH !	1
I had a problem with my graphic card in that the heat from the back end was too much as soon as I put this item in there was a decrease in heat so I am extremely thankful .	1
This expansion slot cooler manages to pump out a surprising amount of air for its small size . I am using three of these to help cool my GPU 's and they work nicely . Just be sure to keep them from touching cards in the nearby slots . I had to sit there for a while adjusting the way they sat in the case to keep them from touching one of my GPU 's fan . This is only an issue with my large GPU 's Sapphire Radion 6870 's	1
I installed this not right under my card , but one slot below that since it gives the air some time to leave the GPU and enter the Antec fan . I 'm not getting the best cooling right now since my front case fan is n't up to par , so make sure that is in order before expecting to see huge results . Realistically , I only see about 2 degrees difference @ idle , have not tried under a load yet , I 'll update when I get a better front case fan .	1
Bought this fan to cool a Dell StudioXPS 9000 . You can hear the fan a little bit but it 's not annoying at all and moves quite a bit of air . The fan is a little bit loose in the slot but nothing to really be concerned about . If the brackets in your computer are the screw-down type the fan wo n't be loose at all.The cord from the fan is about 8 '' long and may not reach your power plugs : you may need a short extension cable . If you have a recent machine with SATA connectors you will need a SATA to Molex adapter which you can buy here on Amazon . This fan has the Molex older style power connectors.My machine has a raid controller and the battery on it was overheating . I bought this fan to cool it down and it worked perfect .	1
This Antec Cyclone Blower fan was very easy to install . I just plugged it in to the power supply and it worked . The air flow is nice and strong.I do n't really think it 's all that noisy . There is a low level hum coming from all the other fans in the computer , anyway and this one blended right in . It did n't amplify the noise in any way . I am quite pleased .	1
Great exhaust fan . Not many options of where to rig it up in your case , ( pci opening is what it 's made for ) . I put my hand behind the case and I can feel the hot air blowing out from this .	1
I put this in the slot under my new GTX 770 card and it runs great . Keeps the whole thing cool . Make sure you have plenty of circulation in the back .	1
Power is an understatement . Moves a lot of air . Can sit next to a video card and keep it cool . Some video cards have a built in fan , but even so , the warm air can accumulate and cause failure . I have seen it happen with the most powerful cards . Now you can get the air to flow on the PCI side of the case . Moves more air than the standard 80mm exhaust fan .	1
Like the other Cables To Go product I have purchased , they good as required and are always available at a good price .	1
These were all the rage 10-15 years ago . Everybody had one under their monitor . I have one for my computer , one for my wife 's computer and one for my stereo and TV equipment ( Why have all the stereo stuff on when I am only watching the TV ? ) . They sold them at all the computer stores ( for cheap ) . You can turn your printer or scanner off and on without having to find some obscure power button . And by not having them on all the time it lowers the electric bill and reduces the chance of a fire ( My neighbor 's house burnt down last week because the TV caught fire in the middle of the night ) .When my Wifes 15 year old unit broke I could only find one made by TrippLite . TrippLite is a first rate company ( even if they are made in China , but is n't everything ? ) and we use their UPS 's at work allot.It 's a good unit with a 10 foot cord which worked out well for me because it was long enough to make it from my Wife 's Computer back to my TrippLite UPS , thus sparing out an extension cord.I am over 50 ( pushing 60 ) and I HATE black face plates on ANY equipment . I ca n't read them without a flashlight and my glasses . But black is `` In '' so there is nothing I can do about it.I would give it a 10 if it was beige and I could read the buttons . Since it is black , I 'll give it a 9.Chaswinchaswin @ hotmail.com	1
I tried others , but they all had their issues . This one meets all my needs . A couple things to be aware of , as with other similar units , the outlets in the back are too close together to properly used specialized plugs or block plugs . For that reason I purchased a 5-Pack of 1-Foot Extension Power Cables to accommodate this special block plugs . Also , the push-button & # 34 ; switches & # 34 ; are the same color as the box , so they can be hard to find if not easily accessible and in a well lit area . I put colored adhesive dots on the buttons as my unit is not in a well lit area ( I do n't have it under my monitor ) . I would recommend this under monitor unit to anyone . I think it is great .	1
Cheap , quiet , reliable ... Need I say more ?	1
Got this to use on my recent holiday to another state . Works perfect for my Olympus camera .	1
Cable reviews are simple . They are great priced , or not , and then work . Or not . This one met both criteria . I was able to plug it right into a few firewire devices with no problems on any of them . The speed matched previous and other cables . I have now ordered a few more from this vendor of different lengths and types and have had great success with them all .	1
Not much to say other than it was n't broken when I got it and it seemed to work OK when I used it . This is not an item I spend much time thinking about . Either it works or it does n't . This one does .	1
Pretty standard product , works as intended , no issues . I would purchase this item again if I needed another VGA cable .	1
I needed to extend the VGA cable coming out of my desktop to reach a KVM that was also servicing a rack mount server sitting on a shelf near my desk and this worked great .	1
I bought this to extend my KVM cables , and it 's as good as Tripp Lite always is . The only issue : the screw-on barrel nuts ( provided ; used to connect this cable to another cable because both of those cables have male thumbscrews ) are n't long enough to allows both sets of thumbscrews to bottom out , resulting in the cables not being held tight to each other . So far no problem , they are staying together from friction , but I 'd feel better about it if I never even had to worry about it because the screws worked as intended . And why would n't a `` monitor extension cable '' have the right hardware on it ?	1
I bought this item to enable me to use my MacBook laptop with my 60 & # 34 ; high definition TV as the display from our sofa . It works just fine .	1
I use this to connect a desktop computer to the overhead projector in out theatre room . Wools great . Now we can project movies and YouTube and hulu and anything else the comes throug a regular desk top . We also have HDMI hooked to the projector but I wanted to leave o stone unturned in those rare cases .	1
Arrived on time , well packaged and with clear instructions . Installation was very easy but so far I have not been able to confirm if it works or not . Signal quality is not affected at all . Make sure you install the ground cable ( green ) into a good ground source otherwise it wo n't work .	1
Good price , have not yet had a dud.Love the printable label area so I can use sharpy to label them .	1
I have a number of the excellent HP Laserjet 6MP printers , as they are awesome . They require a special USB to 1284 cable to work with modern computers . Most of these cables do not work with Mac computers . This one does work , and without any problems.I have tested this Tripp Lite U206-006-R USB to IEEE Gold Parallel Printer Adapter Cable on a number of my macs . It works every time : MacBook running OS X Snow Leopard 10.6Power Mac G5 running OS X Leopard 10.5Power Mac G4 running OS X Tiger 10.4Power Mac G4 running OS 9.2I have tried it on multiple 6MP printers , all work fine.No drivers or any software needs to be installed , the Mac operating system software works fine as is .	1
It works ok , installed without problems , but the software that controls it is a bit unintuitive . Figuring out how to configure it takes a bit more competency than the average user might have . But once it 's configured , it works as expected .	1
I 've got several of the these isobar surge protectors around the house and they 're working great ! So far I 've yet to lose any electronics that have been connected ! I 'm using this in front of a cyberpower ups as for additional surge protection since the ratings are pretty low on the cyberpower ups 's .	1
This surge protector is built very well . It has to be my favorite surge protector and I have quite a few of them . I trust this the most and I put my most sensitive electronics on it.Spend a few extra dollars and get quality , you wo n't regret it . If you save $ 20 on a surge protector that fails you or that breaks after a few years of use , you 'll be kicking yourself for not taking this advice .	1
This , and the other size Isobars , are probably the best surge protector made for the home/business class under $ 100 . Now I must be honest in saying that most of my surge protectors are higher end APCs and Cyberpowers , which cost a little less . However , I am a home user and most of my surges sit mounted 6 inches off the floor indoors behind or inside shelving . APC and Cyberpower make some great surge protectors , but the Tripp Lite Isobar is a step up . It 's built better externally and internally , and its protection is slightly greater . For anyone using a surge that is going to be subjected to less-than-nice environments , this is it . For most home users , the higher price of the Isobar may or may not be justifiable . While it is very expensive , it is quality you can feel , see , and benefit from .	1
Using for a home theater setup . Works well . Excellent value compared with other products with similiar features .	1
I had to have a fairly new smart TV repaired because the power board was fried . The technician recommended this protector and said it should cover just about any surge I might experience .	1
The Tripp Lite Isobar Ultra first drew my attention when I went to work for a local communications company . I noticed that in every one of our offices and in almost all of our customers ' businesses , equipment was plugged into one of these puppies , from the smallest they offer to the largest . I have witnessed lightning storms that have literally blown sockets out of walls , and yet the equipment plugged into the Isobar has remained intact . Granted , some of the Isobars did n't fare as well as the equipment they protected , but they did their job.Having witnessed the quality of this product , I trust it in my own home . Everything from my computer to my entertainment center to my paper shredder is attached to an Isobar Ultra . I highly recommend it for it 's quality and performance .	1
This heavy duty surge protector has helped my computer performance . Could be in my head ... But after about 2 months of using it , some of the computer quirks I had been putting up with are gone . I do not understand the science behind the Iso Surge Protector but regardless , I am very pleased . I watch a lot of video 's on my laptop and I have high speed internet and invariably my movie would lock up for no reason . And since I have started using the Isobar that problem seems to be stopped . ? ? ? The product claims to help computers and I was skeptical but I have to admit that it seems to be true . Anyway that is my opinion . I have n't had a lightening strike so I can not answer for that but the way it is built I have to wonder IF my little plastic surge protectors would have ever really worked ? ? ?	1
I have been noticing a lot of voltage fluctuation in our home . It normally climbs throughout the evening . I bought this to protect my audio video equipment . I have not noticed the hum that others had noted . Of course when the sound and video equipment are running is when the sound is probably more evident and it is being overrun by the equipment it is protecting . This unit gives me a piece of mind that I am taking a step to protect my expensive equipment . I am pleased with the size and the build of the device . It has a good cord set . I set it under a shelf where it gets free air flow as others have noted that it gets hot in use . I have noticed it gets warm when in use but nothing extraordinary . I am sure this increases with load .	1
This is a must for anyone with a home computer and home theatre . This takes care of all the spikes and dips in the utility current . I use several around my home and have suffered no equipment losses since doing so .	1
I have been using one 2400w and two 1200w of these units for about eight years or so . They work , period . I got them initially because my power in Florida condo was bad ... .. one night years ago my vcr fried and my receiver almost did ( got to power switch in time ) . One phase of my condo power was browning out bad , and it was not the one most of the lights were on ... so when it happened , you could just smell burning electronics . An extreme case , but it happened , yep , in the good old USA . I got this device , and it worked ! At the time I was still having power problems , I could here the `` clicking '' of these units as they worked . ( they are , I think , electro-mechanical , as the electronically cut in taps of transforms for stepped voltage regulation ) . But they work . I moved to SC a few years ago , and still use these units . They click occasionally . But , I think , if the voltage is out of range of `` regulation '' of unit , the unit will disconnect power from your devices ... ..this is huge safety thing . I did one cheaper brand one , one stage , and it only lasted a couple of years . Recommended .	1
I use it inside a laptop bag that came with my carry-on suitcase to add more padding ... its great , looks good too . Had it for a year and looks new .	1
After using this CD/MP3 for over a week and reading some of the posts here regarding this player let me make some recommendations regarding using this playe , especially for people who are having problem with this player.SUMMARIES OF THIS PLAYER PROS 1 . Price it 's an incredible price for what you get 2 . Battery life - play at least 4-5 hours of MP3 with a pair Rechargeable Ni-MH batteries ( not supplied by Memorex ) 3 . Read ID3 Tags and supports sub-directories 4 . 45 second ESP shock protection 5 . Reads CDR and CDRW 6 . Acceptable sound quality 7 . Read MP3 files up to 192 kbp ( even though the manual says up to 128 kbp ) 8 . TRUE random file playCONS 1 . Awkard user interface 2 . Even more awkard manual ( I am ashamed of its English - Chinese is my first language too ! ) 3 . No backlight 4 . Resume does n't work if the player powered down 5 . Does not support 256 kbp filesMUST READ SECTION 1 . If you are having problem with frequent clicks , skipping in the middle of playing , or skipping with MINIMUM shaking - return the player - it 's defective . That 's what happened to my first player . I returned it and get the second one which is a REVISED edition ( if you flip the player over you will see a little sticker that says Suffix A which means it 's a revised edition ) . Skipping while shaking is all eliminated and clicks/skips while playing is greatly reduced ( though not 100 % gone ) 2 . Thoroughly test your MP3 files on your computer first to make sure they do n't contain pops and clicks . 3 . Make sure you DO NOT use DIRECT CD to burn your MP3 disc - this has been mentioned before many times 4 . EasyCD Creator is simply NOT a good program to use to burn MP3 because EasyCD only supports ISO-9660 Level 1 format which only supports 8 characters . Burn your disc with NERO 4.0 or NERO 5.0 which supports ISO-9660 LEVEL 2 . Basically ISO9660 level 2 format supports file name longer than 8 characters . With ISO-9660 Level 2 my MPD8505CP displays the first 12 characters of the file name w/o any file name artifact associated with ISO-9660 level 1 + Joliet . This is the solution to file name problems people are having . 5 . Currently I have not have experience with 700MB CDR or CDRW ; once I test that I will post my thoughts	1
I received my player yesterday . I burned a CDR 700 Mb last night and it played flawlessly today . Few skips , same ones I heard in my computer . The interface is not as complicated as my TV remote control is . Sound quality very good with 128 bitrate . AC adaptor , car kit and headphones included . You ca n't get a better deal	1
I brought my brother this camera for his job ; he is a fashion stylist and he fell in love with it , the first time he used it on set ! He said it was easy to use after just a couple of minutes with the instruction booklet he was taking pictures like a pro ; zooming in on the details of his clothes and of the celebs in them ! He loves the quality so much he no longer hires a photographer to be on set with him to grab the pictures for his portfolio that he does it himself and they look amazing ! The clarity and photo quality is top notch and he even changes the background on the images and makes some truly inventive things . He raved about the camera so much that I went out and brought myself one and you know what ? He was right ! This is the best camera I have ever used ! !	1
For the price , this camera gets the prize . The quality of the images that it can produce rival cameras costing twice as much . It has very little delay from when you press the trigger to when the image is imprinted . The camera is very durable and very easy to use . The software that is included is ver simple . In fact , I recently upgraded my camera , but I still use the HP software .	1
The PhotoSmart C315 was actually my third choice when I was looking into digital cameras . I 'd considered the Olympus , but ruled it out on features . I then settled on the Fuji , which was out of stock . Being in a hurry , I switched to this one and have been very happy with the choice.Being a Mac person , my choices were limited to begin with , but I made the right one here ... even if it was by default . Not only does this camera give crisp images , but it also mounts to my desktop as an external USB hard drive for click-and-drag simplicity.FYI- When not using the LCD monitor as a viewfinder , the batteries will last quite a bit longer . Also , the Super Fine mode cuts the number of pictures you can take in half with negligible quality difference between the Fine mode . Stay with Fine unless you 're just set on having fewer pictures.Overall , this camera gives high quality images and is easy to use .	1
I bought this camera 4-1-2001 and so far I am very pleased ! I love to take pictures with it and love the software included . There are all kinds of fun templates for creating a photo album and editing photos ... The HP315 came with everything I needed to get started ... I knew that digital cameras drain batteries horrifically ... The batteries that were included ran out within a few hours of playing with the camera using the LCD and downloading and what not , which seemed ridiculously fast to me ! ! ! ... I think I 'll buy another set of rechargeables ( NiMH ) so when I 'm using one set , I can charge the others . Otherwise , I could just charge the set I have now when I 'm asleep ... I do love this camera 's simplicity and quality , and I highly recommend it , especially for beginners & amp ; intermediates . I 've printed out some wonderful pictures of my kids and pets in fine mode on plain paper with great results ! This is a great camera ...	1
Man , for the price it is one decent piece of equipment for my modest needs of occasional tourist . It also got some tough treatment and withstood it heroically . It is sharp enough for me . If you need a binocular of the size for general field trip where kids and other people who do not care too much about gentle optics will use it , it is one you wish to buy . On other hand , if you know binoculars and expect top performance you need something more refined . For a general , not fancy , public it is awesome buy !	1
This are very well built and nice binoculars . We bought three pairs of them , one at a time . The first one was for my truck . I liked it so well , I bought a second one for our house , and when we bought a motorcoach a few years ago , we bought another set for it as well as you occasionally want to watch wildlife at close range , or figure out what the heck one of your neighbors at an RV park is doing at 4:00 in the morning ... : - ) . These are great binoculars and for the money , you cant beat them .	1
I am an amateur astronomer and this binoculars get the job done letting you make a non deep observation of the sky at night.It 's pretty easy to focus on this ones ( and easy to get them out of focus ) .They include the binoculars ( obviously ) with their protective caps , a not very soft cleaning cloth , a string for hang them and a bag for carrying.The only complain I have is that after a while they feel slightly heavy , but could be because I point them up to the sky in a tiring manner .	1
I bought these so I could watch the ice fishing on the lake behind my house . They work well , easy to adjust , and comfortable for my use . They do n't seem like they would be very rugged for hiking or that they are designed to take a lot of abuse . At this price point that can be expected . For my occasional use in the house they will be more then sufficient !	1
I originally bought a chaep binoculars at at neigbourhood store just for fun , after playing around with it and looking at neighbours and occasionally the night sky , i decided this might be an interesting hobby so decided to look around for a better model , came on amazon and read the reviews for the falcon 10x20 binoculars , and ordered it , boy was i pleasantly surprised , what a difference compared to the cheap one i had before , images are crisp and clear and the focus lever is very smooth and easy to operate , well worth the money . i now spend time looking at the night sky and this does a good job of viewing stars and stuff on a clear night .	1
The only gripe that I have with them is the lens cups just do n't fit . They sit on the lens , so when you lift the binoculars they just fall off . I had to line each cup with electrical tape to make them lush onto the lens . Hopefully that will work in the long-term . One function that I particularly liked is the ease of focusing . Rather than turning a wheel between the lenses , there is a triangular block . You simply move this slightly to bring the object into sharp focus . I like also that the lenses are wide and bright .	1
I have found no problems with these binoculars . Well worth the small amount of money spent . Images are clear , and focusing is very simple . Great buy for someone not wanting to spend a ton of $ .	1
It get 's the job done ! Ca n't be beat for the price ! Do n't forget that it 's pretty powerful at 10X magnification , work 's BEST with your elbows on a table to steady the image but , you can get a great glance for a few seconds free hand as well ! If you go any higher than 10X magnification ( on any binocs ) the image starts to shake and you 'll need a & # 34 ; TRIPOD & # 34 ; to steady the image .	1
Bushnell does it again . These binoculars are incredible , especially at this price . I 'll admit , I was n't expecting the greatest , but being an optimist , I assumed Amazon.com would n't sell me something for $ 25 that seemed of $ 25 or lower value.The binoculars are not only what they say they are , but also of sturdy construction and quality with a tilt focus instead of the cheaper knobs you sometimes see . ( This means you can change the focus without having to run your finger along a knob , shaking your view as it focuses . ) It comes with a strap and a bag , too.The lens caps are a little loose on the eye pieces , but that 's what the bag is for . Honestly , I intend to look through these more than I 'll need eye piece caps anyway . The ones on the lens side are tight , though.In the way of extra notes , these do fog up if you get really , really sweaty , ( was working out when these came in the mail ) but I should hope I do n't bird watching or star gazing , as these are ideal , especially with the 50mm lenses for extra light.Overall , I gave this unit 5 out of 5 because it far exceeds what you 'd get out of $ 25 anywhere else and is more than suited for the tasks I have purchased them for . Good job again , Amazon.com !	1
This router is the best way to share a DSL/Cable connection , hands down . All you need is a NIC in each PC you wish to share and enough patch cable to connect everything.Setup is basic enough and the included documentation is easy to follow and includes enough pictures to help even the non-technically oriented along . Configuring Windows is also easy and between the documentation and included software , most users will be up and running within half an hour.Once you are up and running , aisde from the obvious benefit of sharing the broadband connection , you also are functioning as a peer-to-peer network based on the speed of your network cards ( up to 100mbps ) , which will allow you to finally play Diablo 2 multiplayer or share large files without having to use zip disks . The device also functions as a firewall and with a little tinkering , you can ban certain sites from being visited.All in all , this is a must have purchase if you have more than one computer at home and a broadband connection .	1
I own six of these batteries , and they have all worked fine . I typically go on road trips with some mountain climbing , and I will shoot hundreds of images a day . Generally , I go through about two batteries a day , at this rate . I often camp , so am unable to get to a power source , then have to get a motel room sometimes every other day.Using my EH-21 , I can recharge as many as five batteries a night -- they usually take some 1.5 hours to fully recharge . It 's so convenient to have the recharge light so I know when the charge is completed.I hope to upgrade to a higher MP Coolpix , soon , and the added recharger that now comes along with the camera should make for faster recharging , then able to use two at a time.You do need to keep these babies warm during the night camping , and take them out of the camera while you 're not using them during cool or cold nights.I have to replace a exhausted battery quickly for my Coolpix 880 , since if I wait too long , I must reset the camera settings , including the time and date . My Coolpix 2000 does not have this problem.It 's good to have a few batteries since they take up little room in my camera pack , and beginners might be distressed to find with only one or two batteries , you can run out of juice after only a few hundred shots . I do use my LCD display heavily , and am often turning the camera on and off.Cheers for Nikon that they do not fail to support this product by changing to new types of batteries for their newer models . I plan to get either a 5400 or 8700 , later , since they use the same battery type.These EN-EL 1 batteries last much longer than a set of AA batteries . They have lasted me some hundreds of recharges so far , and I have not had to throw away any of my batteries , going back to 2001 .	1
I needed this lens and it has helped me get better pictures for my night shots . Much faster than my original zooms .	1
Canon L lenses are known for their great optics and priceyness . This fast tele is an excellent value . Some pictures I took at the Phoenix zoo with this lens are superb . Use your tripod and get tack-sharp images . The only thing that would improve this lens would be the addition of the image stabilizion feature found on a few Canon optics . Of course , the advantage of large aperature lenses is that you can set a fast shutter speed and still have enough light for a shot . This lens is surprisingly compact , ( as long focal length teles go ) . The autofocus is very fast and quiet . Comes with a hood , too .	1
Lo adquiri casi nuevo en Costa Rica , con parasol y bolsa por $ 400 , o sea una ganga . He tenido muchos lentes fijos y zoom de la l & iacute ; nea L todos buenos . Pero ninguno supera al 200 f/28 en resoluci & oacute ; n , detalle , color , etc . Este lente se ha convertido en mi favorito a pesar de que no posee estabilizador de imagen . No es apto para fotograf & iacute ; a nocturna pero de d & iacute ; a para fotograf & iacute ; a de personas y naturaleza es insuperable . Para aprovecharlo al 100 por ciento se requiere practicar el enfoque con objetivos peque & ntilde ; os como ojos de aves , flores peque & ntilde ; as , etc.Si lo consiguen usado o nuevo comprenlo y no se van a arrepentir , pero deben tener en cuenta que es fijo y uno debe acercarse o alejarse , o sea es bueno para ejercitarse , lo que es un plus . SUPER LENTE !	1
Interestingly , the price has crept up a bit on this lens in the last few months . It 's value must be becoming more apparent to more folks . Nice to have bought before it went up instead of vice versa.Nevertheless , this is the most reasonably priced of the Canon L Primes & is a perfect one to start out with , if you do n't own any yet . This lens is tack sharp , has very true , very vibrant color and high contrast . In all these areas , it is probably just shy of the 135mm , 85mm and 50mm lenses , but this is a discerning eye speaking , and these are subtle ( although modestly notable differences ) . The difference between this and an ordinary Canon lens will be much greater.As a side note - if you already own either or both the teleconverters ( 1.4x and 2x ) , they work very well with this lens . It maintains AF with both , due to it 's speed . And this is a small light lens , considering the focal length . With a 2x it becomes a 400mm f/5.6 , yet it is much lighter , narrower , and more portable than any comparable variation ( the 100-400mm L , or any of the 400mm L primes , of which there are two , plus a non-L DO prime that looks like an L , and might fool you ) . If you intend to shoot all the way out at 400mm mostly , this is probably the cheapest method , and the quality loss is less with the 2x on this lens than with many/most others.Whatever your choice , this is probably the most reasonable L value on the market and is a very smart buy if you wish to see what all the fuss is about.And Yes , the fuss is warranted . L 's are that good .	1
The only reason I have this lens is better picture quality than any zoom in this price range and more . Forget the entire Canon `` non L '' zooms . They produce muddy non vivid pictures . With the good lighting condition zooms are fine , but any $ 200 camera can make OK pictures in the good day.And there is something more to this L lens ; I mean better consistency of sharpness and skin colors . You know those nasty reddish skin colors . Not with this lens . Less work on Photoshop.Not as convenient as zoom ? OK . The next level is ... . white Canon EF 200mm f/2L IS USM.F/2 and IS ( Image Stabilization ) versus f/2.8 and no image stabilization.Sharpness level is the same . Any price difference ? You check yourself , you will be surpized.Addition . Hm , I did write this review just about 3 years ago . I do not have this lens anymore . I guess the only issue was front focusing with Canon EOS 20D ( and 5D as well ) . Later I had Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM , which I would recomend as a sharp lens . Colors on EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM are not that vivid though .	1
About me : I do photography as my only hobby and have decent skills . I use a Canon 6D full frame and often get pictures which are appreciated by many . Personally , i am very unforgiving on my pics , zoom everything to 100 % and like to count hairs in eyelashes . I do little bit of editing on each and every picture in Lightroom or Elements 11.I already have following lenses : Canon 17-40 F/4 L , Tamron SP 28-75 F/2.8 , Canon 50 1.4 , Canon 85 1.8 and Canon 70-300mm F/4-5.6 IS USM ( non L ) .I used and sold the following in the past : Canon 24-105 F/4 L , Canon 28mm 2.8 IS , 50mm 1.8 , 40mm 2.8 pancake.I use Canon EF 12 extension tube for occasional macro needs , have two 430 EX II flashes and Yougnuo 622C remote triggers.70 % of my photography is about people/portraits and most of it till date has been covered by Canon 50 1.4 and 85 1.8 ( and sometimes with Tamron 28-75 when outdoors ) .I was speculating buying this lens or Canon 70-200 2.8 IS II . Honestly , i ca n't buy 70-200 for the following reasons:1 ) Cost - Most important ... i do n't have $ 2500 in my pocket at the moment and ca n't buy at this price after seeing it for $ 2200 and waiting for better deal but price moved upwards.2 ) White color and size although i could have lived with weight if i had money and it were black.3 ) 1 stop slower aperture than 135mm L although it has 4 stop IS . At times , I can use a tripod or monopod with 135mm and negate its disadvantage of no IS . Personally , i prefer wide aperture over IS and often find ways of reducing shake by supporting my body weight and hands against some object/wall , pausing/stopping my breath for a few seconds , keeping elbows close to ribcage , etc.4 ) My main subject most of time is my 2.5 year old who is always in action and 2.8 is sometimes slow to freeze action in average lit home conditions.135mm is very specialized focal length and not very versatile . I will advise people with crop bodies to stay away until it is very careful decision.Even with a full frame , it was a tough decision for me since i use 85 1.8 and 50mm 1.8 a lot which covers me well and felt that 135 could be a overkill.I rented a Canon 70-200 F/4.0L IS just to try what people are raving about . No , that is not my cup of tea . I knew that F4 is slow but still tried because of amazing reviews . Honestly , i believe that lens is only for good light unless you like high ISO pictures , that 's not me . Even on 6D , i try to keep ISO within 2000 and mostly under 1600.I also tried 70-200 F/2.8 IS ii in lens rental shop with my Canon 6D , just took a couple of pics and was really impressed once i came home and downloaded the pics to my computer . It blew away the similar shots taken with 70-200 F/4 IS.I practiced to use 135mm length on my 70-300 , did n't like it , still pulled the trigger because of 100 bucks off deal on 135 L.It arrived today , now realized that 135mm focal length on a full frame is not bad when it is giving such a fantastic image quality . Its little long indoors and frequently i find myself pushing my back into walls to get some more space . Anyway , i bought it for outdoors and spacious interiors . My 50 and 85 still be my choice in small spaces.I took it in balcony along with 70-300 and shot pictures to compare . 135mm L clearly outperforms 70-300 at 135mm . Also , the cropped picture of 135L was almost as good as 70-300 at 300mm . These pics were shot handheld and remember the IS on 70-300.Although , 70-300 is a good lens in its price range . I will be selling it since it will no longer find a space in my bag when i go out and its of no use at home due to nice primes i have . If possible , i could have kept it to cover that focal range with IS.I am yet to try 135mm with my Kenko 1.4 DGX pro extender.I will be updating my review after a few months of use . Giving 5 stars the very first day since it made a place in my heart on first use . Amazon does n't allow 4.5 stars else could have rated it 4.5 to start with , even a 4 star can bring its rating down from perfect 5 ! I wish canon start upgrading longer prime lenses with IS instead of putting IS on 24 , 28mm and 35mm primes.My future lenses could be:1 ) 70-200 F/2.8 IS ii or 100-400L depending on my interests and finances in the future , neither of them will replace 135L or any of my primes.2 ) Might replace 85mm 1.8 with 85 1.2 , again time and finance will decide.3 ) Possibly replace 50mm 1.4 with 35mm 1.4 L at some point of time to configure my kit better although 50mm 1.4 is an amazing piece of glass.For people on budget , i highly recommend 85mm 1.8 on full frame and 50mm 1.4 on crop for portraits.Finally choosing between 135 L and 70-200 2.8 IS II : This is a tough choice if you have to buy one.Professionals should go for 70-200 for its versatility since they may not like to change lenses too much during an event and probably can justify spending so much.Amateurs : Go for 135mm prime if you wish to create magic/piece of art . Professional photography is mostly about taking pictures that is acceptable to client or exceed their expectations . Being an amateur is a bliss in photography , we can afford to shoot 'when ever we wish ' rather than 'when ever have to ' and it is easier for us to change lens. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Edit : 30-Oct-13I have used this lens for a almost 3 months and have taken more than 1000 pic with it so far . Here is my observation:1 ) I find 135mm very good for portraits where you have space for this focal length . As stated earlier , the disadvantage is lack of versatility . It it too narrow when situation demands something little wider and it is always short when situation demands something telephoto . That is where 70-200 F/2.8 IS excels , 135mm demands lens change frequently or you should have more than 1 camera body . If i have 2 full frame bodies , i can put 135mm permanently on 1 of them.2 ) Although it is F/2.0 , i use it mostly in daylight/dawn/dusk instead of low light situations . It is really that good wide open , i use it 90 % of time at F/2.3 ) Although , glass is simply flawless/perfect , still i feel that Canon should think of releasing Mark II , this lens could benefit from following : - Image Stabilization : This is a mixed bag , IS will make this lens better than everything else ever made but at the same time , lens will become considerably costlier and most people wo n't wish to put so much $ $ $ in fixed 135mm . Probably , 2 versions without IS and with IS like 70-200 lenses ? There could be buyers for both kinds.- I find that it hunts for focus just a little more than newer L lenses , so Canon has some scope for improvement here. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Edit : 16-April-2014 : This lens has become the benchmark for judging/evaluating other lenses . I used to love my 85mm F/1.8 USM before purchasing 135mm F/2 L but not anymore . Also , i have lost love for my 50mm F/1.4 , 135mm has changed the way i look at pictures , i look for perfection . It can shoot full wide open at F/2 , very sharp with no CA or color fringes . In contrast , my 85mm F/1.8 becomes sharp only at F/2.8 and still there is lot of CA and color fringes which i did n't notice earlier when i had nothing to compare against.So , count it as a 'con ' or disadvantage for 135mm F/2 L that it will kill your other lenses . My 85mm 1.8 is up for sale , i am retaining 50mm 1.4 just because it my widest prime and most importantly it is 1.4 which i will replace with 35mm 1.4 only when i have money.With the high standards set up by 135mm , i still like my Tamron 28-75 F/2.8 which i really recommend to everyone if you do n't have money for Canon 24-70 f/2.8 . If i need to live with only 2 lens , these will be Canon 135mm F/2 L and Tamron 28-75 F/2.8Recommendation : Do n't purchase it for crop body if you are not sure of the focal length , it might be too long for you . If possible , rent it for a weekend . Without IS , you will be able to use it handheld only in very good light since you will need to maintain a shutter speed of over 1/200 and at the same time , usable ISO capability of crop sensor is limited . I am writing this since i have seen a lot of people in forums asking it .	1
If you are not doing photojournalism where you would really need a telephoto zoom , and you want the most crisp , colorful and bright images possible , then this is the prime lens to get after the 50 mm if you want a little more distance.Great for portraits as you can really blurr the background and focus sharp on the subject . Also perfect for standing back and not being intrusive to your subjects , this stealth lens takes such amazingly breathtaking pictures . It does n't draw attention to you like the giant white lens tubes.You need to know where you are going and what kind of pictures you will be taking before putting this lens on your camera or else you will be swapping out prime lenses a lot . It has a somewhat narrow field , and it really is n't for long distances , but for any subjects from 10 to 100 feet it is great . The low-light capability is fabulous ! You will need to steady it on something when shooting as it does have some weight and swing to it .	1
At a recent NYE event , I shot a lot of photos in a concert setting without a flash and am very impressed with the sharpness & clarity of this lens performance . Its so fast and the colors are vibrant . I am not a seasoned pro but with the 20D and this lens , it makes me look pretty close . I did shoot in manual and once I got my aperture & shutter speed dialed in , it pumped out a lot of great pics.I have also shot some pics of waterfalls ( slowing down my shutter speed to get that soft flowing image ) and portraits of people and again , it oozed excellence . The 135mm focal range is not as convenient as a zoom , but the quality of this prime lens makes up for any incovenience .	1
This lens has been on my want list for a long time . I have the Canon 70-200 f/2.8 IS and it is great for versatility but it is not an easy lens to carry around all day due to the weight and the white color makes it stand out . The 70-200 produces good bokeh but the best is at 2.8 and 200mm and is n't always possible . I purchased the 135mm f/2 to save on weight , black coating and the bokeh at f/2 . This lens has not disappointed me and the image quality is superb . The auto focus is fast and accurate when mounted on my 5D Mark III . The isolation of the subject from the background produces fantastic results that make pictures stand out . For most of my photography needs this a good lens to compliment my 35mm f/1.4 . I can shoot most subjects and I know that both lenses will deliver great results . The weight savings of the primes compared to the 24-70 and 70-200 is huge and makes the day more enjoyable by not being burdened by the weight of equipment.This lens and focal length does take some getting used to and for some subjects is probably not the best choice . I have found that I do sometimes miss the versatility of the zoom when I am taking pictures of my son playing and he is constantly changing his distance from me and I ca n't always get the picture I want . If he is is playing and moving more parallel to me this is n't an issue but depending on your subject it is something to keep in mind . I would n't call this lens a replacement for the 70-200 but more of a compliment to it . I enjoy the results from both lenses and am satisfied with both . For me most of the time I will grab the 135mm just because I prefer the results that I get and it is much easier to take with me everywhere.Pros : - Ablility to shoot at f/2 and have sharp pictures without stopping down.- Much lighter lens than the 70-200 2.8- Awesome Bokeh that makes your subject stand out against every background.- Decent price for an L lens- Consistent results- Black coating does n't stand out- Great lens to use with the 35mm 1.4Cons : - Lack of versatility- IS would be a nice but it would take away from some of the other things I like about this lens ( weight and price ) .Conclusion : I would say that this lens is a specialty lens and may not be for everyone . The pictures that it takes are outstanding and very few lenses can come close in terms of price and quality . You do give up some versatility but this lens has delivered on all the aspects that are important to me and is my second most used lens behind my 35mm 1.4 . I would not hesitate to recommend this lens to anyone but I would suggest that you look at any of Canon 's excellent 70-200 lenses first if you do not have one .	1
Perfect as a portrait lens . coming from Nikon I thought the 85mm 1.2 would be my best grab , it sucked , get the 135mm f/2 . This lens rocks . The other reviewers have said it all . Excellent , excellent glass at a modest price .	1
I had read most of the reviews on this site and others . Ordered it and it is amazing , took pics of my wife and kids . Budget control ( wife ) was happy and OK with this purchase , that should tell you something . Best portrait lens period . Get it .	1
This will be a short review . All I 'll do is relate a little anecdote.After my first session using the 135mm f/2 , where I shot a young lady at a local park , a coworker came by while I was viewing the images on my computer , looked at the screen and said , `` oh , cool . Did you photoshop the background , or is that a printed backdrop ? '' When I told her it was just the trees and flowers behind the girl , she refused to believe me . `` It 's okay if you photoshopped it . Everyone does it . I think you did a great job . '' I just smiled.If you shoot portraits , buy this .	1
Luscious portrait lens . Perfect focal length for the full frame head shot . IS would sure be nice . You need to work the camera , watch your shutter speed , take your time , and click with abandon to get that perfect shot . This is not a toy lens .	1
Pros : * Very sharp* Auto-focus is smooth and responsive* F2 helps a lot with low-light ( but see cons ) * Not a white lens so you 're not as noticeableCons : * On a crop frame like my 450D , you 're effectively at about 218mm . Without any IS , it can be difficult to hold steady in low-light situations , even at F2.EDIT ( 2012-12-13 ) : Three and a half years later , and now on a 7D , this is still one of my favorite lenses .	1
I have taken only a few dozen shots with this lens ( on a 5d3 ) , but I can already tell pretty quickly , by looking at one of my photos , if it was taken with this lens or with my 70-200 F4L , mainly because of noticeably better contrast and color with the former ( the 70-200 F4 is no slouch either ) . I do n't have much to add to the top reviews , except that those , such as myself , who are not used to such a narrow depth of field , may be surprised by how hard it can be to get a usable picture at F2 , and not by any fault of the lens . If I focus on a person 's nose , the eyes will be out of focus . If I take a portrait of two or more people , I have to make sure that they line up perfectly , or only one of them ( at best ) will be in focus . Interestingly , this suggests that for candid shots of people the wide aperture , in spite of the great ability it confers to shoot in the dark , may be slightly overrated . I was considering eventually upgrading my 70-200 F4 to an F2.8 ; now I am thinking that perhaps the 70-300 F4-5.6 is a better choice for my style .	1
This is by far my favorite lens and money well spent . The auto-focus is lighting fast , sometimes I shocked how fast it locks on . The image quality and sharpness ca n't be found in any other lens . Out of the 8 L lens I own this lens is the best hands down . I use it on my Canon 6D which is nice balance for the camera . My only complaint is the lens hood , it 's ugly and you ca n't remove the lens cap due to the size of the hood .	1
Wonderful lens ! I 've recently purchased 135mm to use it with my 5D and it 's delivering nothing but brilliant photo quality ! I love to use it for portraits and some macro-like shots , a must have lens !	1
Short Answer : Click Buy . Now.Long Answer : This lens has been nothing short of perfect . I bought it used and it had been used for 6 years before I had it but yet I love it more than any other lens I 've ever used . If you follow rumors much you might be concerned by folks who think that perhaps there 's some chance that maybe Canon might possibly update it and maybe will add IS and maybe it will be a better lens and maybe it will come in the year 201X . Notice how many `` maybe '' 's and `` might '' s there were in that sentence . This is a great lens , period . If Canon releases a MkII version of this lens it will probably be over $ 2k and even if it 's better it will not take anything away from this being an amazing lens and phenomenal value . So why do I like it ? 1 . Bokeh - The lens , as you have likely read , has an amazing way of isolating your subject when shooting wide open . The best part about it is that your subject will still be sharp when shot wide open ( at f/2 ) . I find that the sweet spot for me is f/2.8 . Subject is super sharp and background is beautifully blurred ( you do n't even notice it except if it 's hopefully got some nice colors in it ) .2 . Sharpness - As measured above , this lens is amazingly sharp . I 've used it for landscape purposes , portraits , action shots of my dog . Really it can be used for anything ( except maybe group shots , you 'd probably have to go pretty far back to get them which is n't ideal ) 3 . Build Quality - It 's built well with a large focus ring for manual override after autofocusing does it stuff . Autofocus is nice and quick , which helps when taking photos of my dog ( might depend a bit on your camera body ) 4 . Colors and contrast are excellent straight out of the camera . I do very little post-processing . The hood works well but the lens also handles flare very well ( I rarely get any unless I 'm looking for it ) . No chromatic aberration or distortion that bothers me.Those are the three main things I love about this lens . It is great value and of course will hold its value well . Buy it now and do n't think about it any further.The only time I might hesitate to recommend this to someone is if you have an APS-C camera . It is quite long for that kind of camera since it would be 216mm equivalent . Without IS it means that you might have the jack up the ISO a bit when lighting conditions are n't ideal ( cloudy days , evening , low indoor light ) . If your camera body does n't handle high ISO so well that might be a drawback because you might find it difficult to get keepers.For those APS-C folks who might be on the fence about this I would say get the 85mm f1.8 or 100mm f2 lenses for around $ 350 . If you find that you 're shooting just fine with those and you would be ok with a little bit more reach then you will love this and should definitely get it.A lot of people compare this lens to the 70-200mm f/2.8 IS II . I do n't really understand the comparison too much considering that that lens is 2x the weight , greater than 2x the price and does not go to f/2 . If weight and cost are n't an issue then it is a very potent zoom but I think a great kit would have both of these lenses instead of either or . If you find that you really need the 200mm end you could also buy this 135L and the 200L ( f/2.8 ) for less than the price of the 70-200 . Not to detract from the amazingness that is the 70-200 but I think that they are different tools and you will love both of them .	1
An awesome lens , fantastic sharpness , light , and unobstrusive . Great for everything , dimly lit sports , portraits , macro ( with an extension tube ) . My favorite all time lens.I own Canon 's 200mm lens that costs 7 times as much as this , and I still like this lens better .	1
I believe this is one of the best lens for about $ 1000 . Forget about zoom lenses even if they are L. This lens is far better than 70-200L in my opinion . It is very sharp at f2 and even more sharp at f2.5 . With zoom lenses you have to set to f/5.6 for better result and f/8 to match this lens . It is very well built but not excessive heavy , come with hood and bag , but unfortunately , Canon have decided to remove the hard cases for all the L lenses.Combined with a Tamron 1.4X teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality on par with any zoom L lenses at 189mm focal length . Yes I know I lost the convenience of a 70-200 zoom lens . But I am really happy that I decide to change the plan of buying a 70-200IS to 135/2L+1.4X . This not only saves me the money but also let me to get better pictures , especially at wide open . Better portrait lenses , like 200/1.8 and 300/2.8 , would cost several thousands of dollars . Trust me , once you play with primes , you will not like zoom anymore.I am also using a 24-70L to shoot my small kid . After using this lens , I do n't like it anymore and thinking about change to primes someday , the only reason preventing me doing that is the 1.6X crop factor of digital camera . A 35mm/1.4L will become 56mm which is really not good.Order from Amazon with free shipping even though it says not in stock . They shipped mine in 2 days and this happened before even though item stated `` in stock soon '' .Pros : Very sharp at f2 and super sharp start from f2.5.Very fast lens with f/2Very good bokeh ( background blurring ) .Overall extremely good picture quality with good contrast/color.Smaller size , less weight and black color compare to those white 70-200s.It is a L lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring USM AF with FTM.Cons : No hard case.No inexpensive.Effective focal length is 216mm on 10D/20D/Rebel/300D which is a little difficult to use for portrait .	1
Best money ever spent on amazon , this lens is quick and incredible sharp . I use it on my 6D and it 's amazing ,	1
Edit 2-13-12Been using it for indoor and outdoor sports for several months , and I have to say it 's worked out great . I keep getting pictures at f2.0 that i could n't get with other lenses . my current list of activities that I 've used this for are basketball , football , volleyball , and competitive cheerleading . it was a lot of money , but when I see the blurry pictures that other parents get , I know it was worth it.I was a little skeptical of 100 % of reviewers giving this lens 5 stars , but I used it for the first time today , and I have to say I 'm amazed . The in-focus subject is clear and detailed and colors are vibrant , and the bokeh is fantastic . It blows my sigma 70-200mm f/2.8 away . And it 's better than my canon 28mm f/2.8 and my canon 50mm f/1.8 . I was concerned about needing 200mm zoom , but I 'm going to sell my sigma and just crop pictures with the 135mm f/2 . FWIW , my camera is a T1i .	1
Dont buy this lens and i will tell you why , It is fast in any context , anyway you look at it.It is sharp , any way you shoot with it.You will produce ridiculously magical images.Five stars simply are n't enough , I would give it six stars if I could.So do n't buy it . This lens will spoil you rotten , you will sell all your consumer zooms after you try it and you will never be satisfied with anything other than primes from that point on . That said you will have to spend even more money for more primes in the future.I know because it happend to me.True story .	1
Ah the Canon 17-35mm F/2.8L ... a diamond in the rough if I have ever seen one ! I stumbled across this at Keh 's website a few weeks ago ( 04/2012 ) , purchased it , and waited impatiently for it to arrive . Everything I had read and seen about and from this lens filled me with the belief that this was a good investment - I was not wrong . Allow me to go over some bullet points in the name of brevity - I will discuss several of them in detail after.- The price of this lens makes it the second cheapest used L lens on Amazon ( after theCanon 70-200mm f/4L ) - The optics are FANTASTIC.- Build quality is not as good as more recent L lenses- 17-35mm is an excellent focal range- Does n't focus as closely as theCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L , the successor to the 17-35mm- Some barrel distortion below 24mm ( expected ) - Color and contrast are L quality , really fabulous- Has the USM for quiet , quick and accurate focusing- No Image Stabilization ( IS ) , I do n't count this against the lens- Slightly smaller than the 16-35mm linked to above- Lens hood is getting hard to find- No weather-proofing as far as I knowBUILDThis lens is not as well built as modern L glass - back in the late 90's/early 00 's , many consumers complained to Canon asking for better-built lenses but this lens had already been out for some time when the change came . That said , it is not poorly built and is still infinitely better than regular EF/EF-S . It is slightly smaller and lighter than its successor , either good or bad depending on your needs and wishes.FOCUSAs mentioned above , this lens does have the Ultra-Sonic Motor for smooth and accurate focusing . I find it focuses VERY well , spot-on almost every time ! I will say that coming from renting the newer ultra-wide L lenses , the lack of very close-focusing takes a little getting used to and can sometimes limit your creativity on-the-fly , but people have managed for years to create incredible images with this lens , and I ca n't see why one could n't continue to do so . Not inconvenient enough to take off any stars ! COLOR/CONTRASTThis is a VERY sharp lens , with excellent color reproduction and contrast . It is infinitely better than any kit lens , and even today will outperform the wide primes from Canon 's EF line . It is n't as good as the newerCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8L , but definitely performs outstandingly . If you have n't , I would highly suggest jumping over to the Flickr group for this lens , the work there is exemplary.IMAGE STABILIZATIONNow , call me old-fashioned , but I think that IS on a ultra-wide lens is rather useless . If I need to shoot at anything under 1/17th of a second ( maximum recommended for hand-held ) I would use a tripod . Using a tripod trumps IS ANY day , and so I do n't count this as a mark against this lens . In fact , I count it as a plus seeing as it makes the lens a lot cheaper ! DISTORTIONObviously , under around 24mm there is barrel distortion , although this is to be expected from any super-wide lens and is not more prominent than any other I have used . There is some vignetting wide open , but stopping down or post-editing in photoshop fixes this quite nicely.OVERALLFor around six hundred bucks , you are getting a fantastic fast super-wide lens from Canon 's L series . The glass is excellent , and while it lacks a few of the more modern features , it is still a pro-grade autofocus lens , and comes with me on every wedding shoot so far ! If you have the cash , theCanon EF 16-35mm f/2.8Lis better , but I 'm not sure if it 's a thousand big ones better . Highly recommended - a cheap and effective way to get L glass ! !	1
This lens is one of the best I ever owned . I create master portraits with this . See the example I have uploaded . This lens is good for events as well . The wide angle enables you to do close courtiers shooting . The lens is slow focusing but not very erratic on the focus once it finds it it locks on like a bull dog . Unlike some of the sigmas that get confused between 2 af points and go back and forth . This may be one of my most favorite lenses of all times . Almost never leaves my camera except when I need distance . Like 200 to 400 and above for wild life .	1
This is my very first `` L '' ( for `` Luxury '' ) lens and I 'm just elated with my purchase . It 's below $ 1000 ( which most L lens inversely cost ) but the quality of the shots I 've taken looks so professional . Only drawback is its f/4 maximum aperture . But as long as I 'm taking pictures outdoors , the f/4 opening is just fine . I did try taking pictures with it indoors , I just have to push the setting to ISO1600 and sometimes pop up the flash and the pictures also turn out well . For an amateur like me , this lens is a very GOOD buy !	1
Update 2-Sep-13 : Put on CM 10.2.2 ( Android 4.2.2 ) last week . I 've got to say , it 's nice . Fonts are small , though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues ( google this ) . Netflix works , and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior , battery life is same as CM7 . In general I like it better than CM7 . My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes , no BT , no GPS . Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012 : I 've installed Cyanogen 7 , which works with button savior . I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card . Fonts are sometimes a bit big , as is line spacing , but in general , CM7 frees you of the B & N ; walled-ness , even as somewhat mitigated below . Netflix does n't work , and Google Chrome wo n't run on Android 2.3 . Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review , Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary , followed by the details if U are interested . I hope people will read reviews here , as , if you say much at all on B & N ; 's site , they do n't post your review and do n't allow you to modify it so that U can post it ! : A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to : - Read ebooks purchased from B & N ; - Browse the web on a tablet- Play a small selection of games , having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to : - Buy a full selection of games/apps- Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad , Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.- Play music where U can sort by artist , album , genre , etc.- Play mpeg videos- Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work , you can do all this by modifying the device . I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months , before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it . This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it 's essentially a normal 7 '' Android tablet now.The Details : ============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011 . She 'd been saving for an iPad ( ~ $ 500 ) but at the rate she was saving , we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read ( and so do us parents ) , she also wanted to use it as a music player , and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car , on a plane , etc , and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $ 150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time , and no micro SD slot . A deal-breaker . This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab , Nexus , etc . Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot , we went to a store to take a look . Sales guy was good , and the device hardware shows well . Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup , we found the first of our issues : Issue # 1 : Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage , you can only place your own items in 1GB . The rest is for B & N-purchased ; content . 1GB is not enough for a music collection , or any significant amount of video . A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking , having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up ( easy enough ) , annoyance # 2 showed itself : Issue # 2 : App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples : Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.- BN Market : $ 2.99 , $ 3.95.- Amazon 's Android Market : $ 0.99 ( ad-free ) , with free ad-supported versions available- Android Market , $ 0.99 for either , plus free , ad-supported versions available.- Apple App Store , $ 0.99 and $ 0.99 , plus free , ad-supported versions available.YouTube : free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of , not available on the Nook Tablet , not in the Nook store.I did n't buy either game , but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon 's Appstore without rooting the device , esp . if it 's running v1.4.0 of the software . I got that working and bought $ 0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds . While I was at it , I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them , and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I was n't home for Christmas , but I did have my work laptop which has music on it . I copied some over and began to use the music player ... .Issue # 3 : Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used . U can , generally , sort by artist , album , etc , and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white . The Nook built-in music player does n't allow sort . For this , I did n't want to buy a music player , so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb 's ( Android 3.0 's ) music player , which is free . Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market . The problem was n't quite solved , because changes to the SD card ( adding files ) were n't recognized . I tried Winamp , Songbird and Android 4.0 's music player when ICS came out . They had the same issue . TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time . I now run Cyanogen , whose music player ( modified stock android to add gesture support ) works just fine . They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B & N ; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version , plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like `` & lt ; '' , say , and it 'll go back a track . This would be great while driving . ( Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which , though I 'm not sure , would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to ) .Issue # 4 : Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I 'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials , saving them as mpg videos . These would n't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player , free version , which plays them fine . U can do this only if U 've installed Amazon 's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market . People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use . No need - just get another video player . MX Player Tip : brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen , volume on the right.Issue # 5 : UI Inflexibility==========================U ca n't add shortcuts to the desktop , and ca n't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either . For this , I installed App Manager ( tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb , so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market ) . This is a fantastic app and I do n't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also , there 's one physical button . Standard android buttons such as menu ( right-click ) and back are n't always around in the UI , and holding home does n't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android . They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device . Update after a month rooted : use Button Savior , which gives soft buttons with a flyout . Once in a while , you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen . Update post Cyanogen : CM7 can have soft buttons ( back , menu , home , etc ) displayed all the time , if desired , and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue # 6 : Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say . BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable . It charge very slowly , even if it does n't tell you it is , when connected to a PC because or other charger . With some irony , B & N ; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage . If they could charge with any micro-USB cable , they would n't have to . Update post-Cyanogen : With Cyanogen , it charges with any micro-USB cable , though slowly unless it 's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue # 7 : OTA update breaks all the niceness I 've achieved==========================================================An OTA update , v1.4.1 , will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging . I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work , but U ca n't disable OTA updates . U can if you root , though , so I did , then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually . It 'll never auto-update . Update post-Cyanogen : irrelevant now.Goodness # 1 : Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy , installs apps fine , opens them quickly , videos are fairly smooth , scrolling is pretty good ( but not as nice as Apple 's ) .Screen is great from angles , clear and bright.It 's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness # 2 : the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented , though I give Amazon 's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI . Doing so from the web is also very fast . A web order using a computer of a B & N ; sample appeared about an hour later , but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness # 3 : Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes , these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads . I know . I do like the talking kid 's books ( reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen , but without the ability to touch words and hear them ) , and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce . This is good for cooking ! U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness # 4 : Good if U Root it , for $ 250========================================When rooted , it 's a nice tablet + it has the B & N ; connection , and it cost $ 250 . It is n't an iPad ( no cameras or BT ) , and it 's half the price . Update Nov 2012 : There are now a multitude of 7 '' tablets ( ASUS , Samsung , Google ) which get my recommendation .	-1
The price of this tablet I do love.Thats about it.First of all the design of the the tablet feels very cheap.Almost the whole shell of the nook is plastic.Since also the home nook button neing plastic sometimes it gets stuck and makes it hard to push.The format of the homepage I do not like.If you want new wallpaper you have to download a picture file file onto your nook same with music and video.You do get the apps hulu netflix and pandora but thats very limited.Whats also very limited is the app store.What a joke.The apps are all very boring and overpriced.The book are usually never free.The only Up to this tablet it you can watch flash video which is basically the only upside to this piece of junk.Either save up your money for an ipad or or kindle fire.I will be returing my nook ! ! ! !	-1
Beware . I bought this used and the person or company I bought it from did n't have the common sense to de-register it from the previous owner . That should be done before you sell it . No excuse .	-1
in my honest opinion nook is unfinished product.none of my technical books in pdf format i was able to read due to pdf reader rendering formulas all over the screen with middle-size font.i am able to see formulas in small font but then the rest of text is unreadable.formula rendering in medium font is a mess however text is readable . i would have expected developer of the device spent more time on fine-tuning the text rendering on ebook reader .	-1
I got this for my wife as a Christmas present because we have a bunch of books in ePub format . I put them on a microSD card , went through the arduous setup procedure and now it will not open any of my books . I have , over 6 hours invested today trying to get support help . Phone goes to some third world place and I can not understand the people . Chat ( 4 times ) is better but they finally concluded it wad my credit cards fault ! ! Basically , useless support.Returning it tomorrow ...	-1
I think that all international customers should be forewarned that Barnes and Noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore , you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States . This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States ( even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B & N ; membership ) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble ( via phone ) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books , but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors , a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card ( all bought on Amazon ) , I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome , there should at least be some type of warning on their website . I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble , and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife . Shame on Barnes & Noble , that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale , my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product . Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books , they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned , they have lost this customer permanently.P.S . This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com , my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers . ( UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE ) In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100 % reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that 's based in the USA to see if B & N ; would be able to access the funds from that account , I 'm trying to find out whether it 's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just ca n't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B & N ; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B & N ; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card ( books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States ) .I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet , it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they can not access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it 's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account . I 'll post an update as to whether it worked or not . ( UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE ) I 'm sorry for taking so long but anyway , let us get on with it . As I said before , every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem , what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B & N ; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card ( books can only be sold to customers `` physically '' residing in the United States ) .Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card . I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card , so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location , or IP address . The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards , some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves , in cases like this I 've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal . I 've never had any issue when paying via PayPal , even when other forms of payment could not work.I hope that this helps a little .	-1
Received this as a gift last Christmas ( 11 months ago ) . Manual claims that at a typical rate of reading , one should be able to use it for a month on one charge . My battery already lasts only 2 - 2 1/2 hrs on one charge before the unit wo n't start due to a low battery level , requiring recharging . This is either a false claim on the part of B & N or else the batteries they use are of exceedingly poor quality . I 've used hundreds of rechargeable batteries of various brands and technologies over the years ; if this thing suffers from a battery problem , then the batteries in these devices are on par with the cheapest quality / lemon nicad rechargeables I use to encounter 25 years ago . Keep away .	-1
I had to put generic Android on it because Barnes and Noble had it so hamstrung . Should have gone with the new 7 & # 34 ; Nexus . No built in GPS turned out to be a major lack .	-1
I am already a kindle owner and I love my kindle . The kindle does have some limitations , most especially in the handling of pdfs . The kindle does not annotate and curate highlighted text of pdf 's you upload . This is where I found the Nook HD more useful , apart from the fact that it gives you full access to the Play Store . In handling big pdf 's , the Nook HD is slow and the highlighting of scanned pdf 's is not very smooth . I really tried to love the Nook but did not and so I did not use it beyond the first month . I will not recommend the Nook . If your goal is the android store , just get a nexus tablet and download B & N app . It is cheap and works much better than the Nook .	-1
Bought this to replace the broken micro usb cable on my old charger for my Nook Tablet . Wished I could just get the cable as the AC plug works fine . After 2 weeks the micro usb end of the cable broke again . This is the 3rd Barnes and Noble cable I have gone through and will not be purchasing another from them again . Any plain micro usb cable will charge the Nook Tablet , so save some money and get a cheaper unbranded cable instead .	-1
Drive simply will not mount . I imagine this must be fine for the person it works for but I 'm returning mine as non-functioning .	-1
After just two cycles of the batteries , they stopped working in my tactical flashlight . I measured the voltage and found them to be almost 4.2 volts fully charged ( when it is supposed to be 3.0 ! ! ! ) . I do n't know if this can damage a voltage regulated light , but I 'm not willing to take the chance ( they do n't work in two separate types of flashlights I have anyway because they immediately shut off when turned on with these batteries now ) . I 'm returning these and buying some surefire non-rechargeable batteries . What good is a tactical flashlight if at the exact moment you need it to work , the batteries fail ? And if you are n't using it for tactical purposes , then why get a light with CR123A batteries in the first place ? Even when this charger WAS working ( only on the first cycle ) , it got way too hot for comfort while charging and took way longer than it says . Also , the light turns halfway to green but stays halfway red , and does n't charge both batteries evenly .	-1
Would n't buy this again . I never really used the product because it didnt fit the phone that well with the phone case on .	-1
Well it seemed to be working fine for about six hours , then it began discharging my GPS completely . Had to charge it several hours in car to get it working again .	-1
THIS PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE AT J AND R. YOU ENTER YOUR INFORMATION AND THEN GET TO THE PLACE WHERE IT SAYS : `` PLACE YOUR ORDER '' AND THE CART GOES TO `` 0 '' . REAL DRAG . i CALLED JANDR TWICE ABOUT REMOVING THIS PAGE FROM AMAZON BUT THEY SAID IT TAKES TIME .	-1
I used this product on a Philips DVD Recorder . Horrible Mistake ! ! ! It must have screwed up the lens alignment because all discs that are now inserted into the drive come back with the message `` NO DISC '' and no playing or recording can be done . It ruined my machine !	-1
Trust me it does not work . I have tried it on all rooms , anddoes not transmit . Waste of money . If you want an item that does work I have found the SBC wireless to be the best and you can buy it at amazon or walmart .	-1
This product does not have caller ID and makes a hissing sound that is irritating . I bought it from BuyAccessories , who weregreat with customer service and refunded my purchase . I will buy from them again . It 's not their fault the product is mediocre .	-1
I thought I ordered both receiver and transmitter , had to re-order by phone . They told me they would send me a R.A. by email and I never got it now I 'm stuck with two orders .	-1
This device did not work for me . They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal . That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers . In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours , so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money . I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me . But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones , so far I have not had any interference . You have to try them and see what works for you .	-1
This extension requires one of the following Wireless Phone Jack Systems : RCA RC 926 , GE GE926 or D916 . ( per packaging ) . It does NOT work with the RCA RC 930 , which Amazon is bundling with it . Do n't buy it with the RC 930 !	-1
I used it once and my sister long distance could n't even tell . I have used Plantronics plastic tube-type microphones at work and the sound quality was better the sister said.It was weird to have a very lightweight headset on my head -- instead of a phone clenched between my head and shoulder . But ! I knew it was something I could learn to love quickly.The mike was not quite long enough however ... call me a big mouth ! It did n't reach around in front of my face . It was very much to the side . Just in the peripheral vision ... again something I was sure I could get accustomed to.But . The next time I plugged it in , if I touched the cord or the phone or moved there was massive crackling . I gave up after a few more tries . I should of sent it back ( Amazon is SUPER about replacing items ) but did n't really think about it until the warranty had expired.I am ready to try again . But this time will read all the reviews before purchasing .	-1
I 'm not brutal with equipment , but in a few short weeks , the flimsy plastic part that holds the ear pieces to the headset broke on one side . Within a month or two the other side went as well forcing me to use office paper clamps to hold the whole thing together.I use them in bed late at night when the household is asleep . A second convenient bedside charger would be nice . I tend to put them down on the bedside table before I doze off rather than get up and walk across the room hook it up for recharge . If you 're a late night TV watcher , you too might call this justifiable laziness . Too many times I put them on the next night and find the battery 's down.I honestly think that before I replace them with another wireless , I 'd find a way to sneak an extension wire across the room through attic or basement space and go with a standard wired headphone .	-1
I 'll never understand why re-useable cable ties are so expensive , or so unavailable . These Belkins are really for permanent stereo or computer installation . And even for that purpose , I do n't care for their design.If you are a musician looking to tie up microphone , speaker or instrument cables , these are not suitable .	-1
the whole tie Velcro to it self only at the end of it is there the opposite type of Velcro .	-1
Instead of the pictured Belkin cable , I got a flimsy generic cable . Total and complete rip off .	-1
I bought this bag for a 15.4 '' laptop mbp , an extra battery , a spare HD , and some papers . Not very much stuff . So I was extremely disappointed that a $ 90 leather bag that supposedly was of good quality had one of the straps completely rip off the body of the bag , where the strap was stitched in the side.This bag was used for 7 months before the strap ripped under normal , daily usage . There was nothing done to shorten the life of a bag such as this one .	-1
I was going to buy one of these cases for my new Palm Vx . It looked great and I figured if it was made by Palm that it would be a good buy to keep my new toy ... I mean tool ... safe . Fortunately , I saw one in a store before I ordered one . As some of the other reviews have said , it 's made out of cheap plastic with a thin sheet of metal on the front for decoration . The hingers are fragile and the spring-loading is weak . I do n't think it 's worth the cost and I 've seen them as low as $ 25.If you 're buying a hardcase , I 'm assuming you want some protection for your Palm . This wo n't give it to you . If you just want something that looks good to cover-up , there are lots of nice leather ones out there.As for me , I decided to spend the extra money on a Rhinoskin molded aluminum case . I 'll let you know how that goes . So far , so good ... check them out .	-1
I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years . I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home . Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit . Currently only ONE still works ! I have very infrequent power outages , perhaps three in the past four years . These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down . My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD . I ca n't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin , but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores . There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC 's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand . My experience over the past four years has been mixed . These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes . If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear . I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms . Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance . The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years . I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years ; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries . Prices vary from $ 15 to $ 50 depending on the vendor . Battery life depends on many factors so I do n't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable . I bought APC branded batteries and ca n't explain why the recurrent failures . I 'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model . Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS !	-1
Unlike many of the other Minidisc owners on here , I happen to like MP3 . The minidisks are great ... .but for something small and light to tuck in my pocket , nothing beats the Rio ! It 's at least half the size and a third the weight of my minidisk player . And yes , the size DOES make a difference to many people.I love getting free MP3 's off the web , and while I *could* put them on minidisks , I like being able to every day or so put a completely different assortment of songs on the Rio to listen to . It 's certainly not much harder than recording a disk and I 'm one of those people that can listen to favorite songs over and over so a little repetition does n't bother ME any.Unfortunately , the Rio is not without faults . In fact , I have a hard time recommending it . 32 meg is definitely NOT enough . I got a Flash card , and have started having varying problems , first with my memory being unusable , and then having small chunks become corrupted . Am now having problems with the player intermittently stopping on its own and freezing up so I have to remove the battery . Oh , should mention that the first Rio I got had a broken battery compartment and was returned . Am still waiting on my rebates . HATE not being able to use it on Windows NT , and not having USB . And the headsets that come with it are worthless for many people . Personally , I 'm not sure I even want to try the later Rio models , as I 've had so much trouble with this one in only a few months of owning it .	-1
. STOP ! ! ! . 1/ This camera is NOT 640x480 , is a fixed 320x240 . CCD is not even 1/3 megapixel , is 1/10 I think . Images are bad ( like enlarging a thumbnail ? ) Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they 'll be somehow fine , anything bigger is like old CGA ... awful . When you take shots they look very bad , whatever you do to edit ( software ) and fix them . I have another ( true ) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent , but these ... 2/ It does n't include an AC adapter , so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3/ Fine as a serial videoconference camera ( 30 fps ) , but watch for the batteries.4/ Take your first picture , and begin to wonder if it 's ok . The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother you when you find out you ca n't review your shots . Think about it : you wont review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very disappointed .	-1
I got this from a yard sale . The cords are unwieldy . The bass is too strong and is not adjustable . Stay away from systems that do not have adjustable subwoofers .	-1
I was very disappointed with this product.As one other reviewer said the stem is too short . So others can hardly hear me . Obviously , if they can hardly hear me then what good is the product ? For instance , ever try getting a flight itinerary straight when the other person can hardly hear you ? ( And I 'm short myself , so it 's definitely not a matter of my having oversized head/mouth dimensions . ) But , even when I took off the headset and held the mike right near my mouth and at other positions the sound was described as muffled and somewhat low , though without background noise.I also found the headset somewhat uncomfortable and difficult to put on at the moment . I do n't have a need to wear one all the time , but just for certain calls . I often found myself fumbling to get it on . I think I 'll try an over-the-head model next .	-1
I bought a new pair of Motorola Talkabout FV300 radios and it simply does not work with them . When I plug it in , turn it on and press the PTT button , the radio starts transmitting and does n't stop until I shut the radio off . I knew the VOX feature would n't work , but it was my understanding that it was supposed to still work with manual operation of the PTT button . It does not . However , it does work with my older Talkabout which is a T5000 , but not with VOX . I 'm giving it two stars because they should have been more clear as to which radios work and which do n't .	-1
JR Music and Amazon must be KIDDING to think that they do not need to have a policy to make it obvious that this is a USED product . To bury the fact that this item is `` reconditioned '' at the very BOTTOM of a multi-page description instead of in the TITLE or first line is deceitful ! They are selling used goods as new and treating the fact that this item is used as part of a disclaimer buried so far down that they know most people will not notice it .	-1
'Snagless ' ..I thought is was a flat wound cable or something , but it 's just a regular cable and overpriced at that .	-1
I ordered both the Belkin 25 ft CAT 5e and the Belkin 50 ft. CAT 5e cables since I was not sure if the 25 ft cable would be long enough -- - as it turned out the 25 ft cable was just what I needed so I did not use the 50 ft. cable . The 25 ft cable comes in Belkin packaging and markings but ( like other reviewers stated ) the 50 ft. cable comes in a plastic bag that says made in China and there is no indication that the cable is a Belkin.I gave this 2 stars because it does not appear to be a Belkin product -- - I would give the 25 ft. cable 5 stars .	-1
The only positive thing I can say about this tripod is that it is very light and very cheap . I tried to use it several times - does it 's job only if the camera is positioned right on top ( 90 degrees ) . If you move the camera and change the angle the top stand twists and fall back under the camera weight . I was using canon powershot S3 IS , which is really light . I ca n't imagine if you use it with a dslr camera . My final conclusion - It is good if you do n't need to change the vertical position of the camera .	-1
Does Not Work for 720k formatting . If you need to be able to format to 720k , this will not work . Otherwise it works fine , but I gave it 2 stars because I am unable to use it and I hope others can be saved the trouble .	-1
Well , I had read all the reviews of this model on Amazon and based my purchasing decision partly on this information . I expected picture quality from the 310 to be at least as good as my old PAL Sony 8mm . However , after 2 weeks of using the 310 we had to conclude that it simply provides inferior picture quality in most lighting situations . Inferior in both colour reproduction and in clarity , whatever the technical specs . say . For example , I have a coat with a maroon sleeve but this appeared bright red whatever exposure or program setting I used ; same with the shop model we checked with when returning the purchased unit to the store - it did n't appear to be just a snafu with the particular unit we had purchased . We also compared the 310 picture with the supposedly inferior Panasonic 910 and both colour and clarity were actually better on the latter . Why ? What is Sony playing at ? We were expecting twice the clarity ( & quot ; resolution & quot ; ) and 3 times the colour depth from this Digital 8 camera , as widely advertised . What are they talking about ? When it comes down to it , its about picture quality , no matter what bells and whistles the machine has.Boy , was I glad to get my money back !	-1
Bought this to use for labeling binders and to label how much money remains on gift cards.The ribbon that prints seems to have been sitting on the warehouse shelf for too long . It partially prints each letter/number like some of the ribbon has gotten old and wo n't stick to the label . I would not recommend this product .	-1
Used it for a couple of months and decided to switch to a VHF radio . Reach is minimal , even two cars driving next to each other does n't allow for good communication . Go for a talkabout if you look for something simple or a VHF if you want long distance good quality communication .	-1
As hanheld the range is very poor . Forget about using it inside a car , it will not pick anything , not even the weather channels . Running on batteries as a handheld picks up car engine noise from even 3 feet away . Paired with Midland 18-2442 Mobile CB Antenna for use in the car and while the range has greatly improved , there is a lot of noise , making it hard to understand any conversations . The antenna was tunned with a SWR meter to about 2:1 , which is great , but noise still present . NOAA channels were clear the first two days but now barely work . Also picks engine noise . Tried using chokes on DC powerline and also on RF but no luck , engine noise still present.I got this to use on my car as I spend quite sometime on the road but for now I 'm quite disappointed after a week of usage and tweaking . It should work right out of the box ! Going on a trip to Canada this week so I 'll be testing it further ( 1200mile trip ) then i 'll decide if to exchange it or just get a refund and look for some other solution.The idea is great . Love it.The implementation sucks . : (	-1
This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tie-up information of close-by autos ... .the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield ... .I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks ... .the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work ... it fell off and was lost after about 10 days ... .the second one I put on myself ... and followed the directions to an exact degree ... .including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes ... .cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc ... .using silicon to seal the unit further ... this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost ... .the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge , much to their credit ... .I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather ... I have my fingers crossed ... .would I buy this again ... .definitely not ... ..probably no through the glass units from anyone else either ... ... ... ... ...	-1

I did my homework , and though I knew this trackball was mechanical and rather an old model , I still thought that overall many people had been happy with it . I have used trackballs before to a limited extent , and my husband has the Kensington Optical Trackball with the cool red glow , but I wanted something that would better match my Mac . Well , forget about that . The Orbit got very difficult to manipulate very soon after use ... I had cleaned it several times in the first week , and I am a clean freak where the area around my Mac is concerned . I found that the tiny springs inside were very fragile and one was not really in the right place . After two weeks I sent this back to AMAZON . It is pretty , it SHOULD work better , but after thinking it over I ditched `` matching '' , went out to Staples and tried the Logitech Marble Mouse . It is a great fit for my hand , and now resides on my desk . The marble mouse is cheaper too , which is odd . If I had n't wanted a trackball right away I would have bought it at AMAZON . Your options are n't that great pricewise as far as trackballs go , which makes the Marble Mouse a really good deal , unless you are a power user of photo manipulation software or other specific apps which need many buttons programmed .	-1
Bleck , bleck , bleck ! Do n't let this trackball sour you from the concept . Trackballs themselves are MUCH better and MUCH easier on your hands , wrists , and arms then regular mice , but this one is a real stinker.First off , it 's FAR too heavy . The ball is mechanical , NOT optical , so it makes for slow , plodding , difficult motions . It 's a chore to push your cursor across the screen and it really causes a lot of fatigue in your hands and fingers.Secondly , it 's just not as comfortable as other , similar designed trackballs like the MUCH easier and OPTICAL Marble Mouse by Logitech . This one is just too wide in the base for me and the buttons were too far stretched apart . There was n't any natural & quot ; drapping & quot ; of the hand on this design.Thirdly , it 's WAY overpriced . For ten dollars less you can get an optical trackball which will give you a lot more percision with a lot less effort.For those who like this style , I highly recommend you opt for the Logitech Marble Mouse . At about $ 20 , it 's a much better value . I used one for about five years and noticed a GREAT reduction in wrist pain.For those wanting more options ( such as scroll wheels and such ) , I would suggest the very well designed Logitech Cordless Optical Trackman . It 's what I upgraded to after using the Marble Mouse for so many years . It does require a slight change in position of hand , but it stays away from those horridly uncomfortable thumb-wheel designs you see ; you still use your fingers to roll the main ball around.Do yourself a favor and get a trackball . Just make sure it 's an optical one instead of a mechanical one . You 'll really be thankful you did and you 'll notice improvement and relief from wrist/hand/arm pain .	-1
This was a good starter card for watching television through my computer . It worked well with Windows 98 , but if you were thinking of using it with any operating system released this century , you 'd find yourself out of luck . Initially , with 98 , I thought very highly of the TV Wonder . However , upon upgrading to Windows 2000 , I had to download extra drivers from ATI which ended up locking up the computer after watching TV for more than a few minutes . After that , I thought XP would handle it a little better . Unfortunately , it was worse . I could n't find any software support from ATI that would co-exist with Windows XP , and have yet to.In retrospect , I probably should have gone with the TV Wonder VE which is compatible with Windows XP after downloading an updated driver from ATI 's site .	-1
I have had this changer for approximately 5 weeks , past the Amazon 30 day return policy , unless stocking charges and shipping costs are paid by me . JVC will not exchange the unit but will repair it at their local authorized dealer.At first , there were seldom , random skips , garbles , and lyric repeats . These have become more frequent and annoying . Pristine discs made no difference and changing the optical cable did not help . My ten year old Yamaha changer , it has drawer problems , plays my discs flawlessly.So far , this is the only problem but a major one that is getting worse . Everything else is working and I do like the unit . The sound quality is superior to my old Yamaha and the remote is better.I do not know if this unit can be fixed or , like with cars , the repair people can not duplicate the problem.I am not going to put a lot of time , energy , or gas into getting this changer repaired beyond my first attempt . Maybe DVD changers are made better and I can use one as a CD player ? I am disappointed , to say the least , and from my experience , I know purchasing electronic components can be a gamble . I hope your purchase goes better.Update : 1/21/09I took the unit in for warranty repair . They replaced the laser and on the technician 's equipment , both analog and optical cable connections were tested , the unit played flawlessly . On my home system with a new optical cable , I again had the original problems . I gave the unit to a friend and it works perfectly on his sytem using the analog connection . It must be a hand shake issue with my equipment so I no longer believe it is the unit itself . I have read that some electronic equipment combinations do not always work well together . I conclude that was my situation .	-1
This product is made in China and runs for ten seconds one cycle at a time with automatic rewind and no sound or video accompanying . This product is not like the previous head cleaner which had four cycles of aproximately two minutes each with a sound and video format . I liked the original product much , much better - not happy . Try to find Maxell SKU : 290058 , UPC : 025215290053 , to see if it does the job .	-1
I put the tape in and it immediately turned off my vcr and ejected the tape . I tried again and the same thing happened . I tried it in another vcr and the same thing happened . Amazon gave me a full refund .	-1
Warranted for lifetime but 9 dollars return EACH ( even if shipped multiples ) for shipping plus whatever you pay to ship to them to repair facility . They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less ( no matter how many ) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here . Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good ( usually last me about 2 months ) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good . They fit well and stay in good too .	-1
I wanted to try these because I use my mp3 player in noisy environments , and they were supposed to be able to fit tightly into your ears and block the outside noise . Well , I never was able to use them and finaly gave up on themn . I tried many times to squeeze the foam and hoped that they would mold to the shape of my ears , but it was never satisfactory . I found them very uncomfortable .	-1
Good sound isolation , too much bass for realistic sound , might be ok if you only listen to disco ... very uncomfortable after about 30 minutes .	-1
I 've tried out a number of noise-cancelling and isolating headphones with an iPod . Here are my impressions : Shure E4c ( isolating ) : the most accurate and open I know of . With high-quality source electtronics and material , these ( or the E5c 's ) would be the pick of the lot . Unfortunately , they 're too revealing for listening to compressed source material through the mediocre electronics of an iPod and very quickly become very fatiguing in that context . Their other disadvantage is obvious : they 're quite expensive.Sennheiser PXC 300 ( noise-cancelling ) : these are my favorites . Very accurate without being too unforgiving for an iPod . Their disadvantages : comparatively bulky & wo n't play as loudly as any of the others mentioned here.Sennheiser CX300-B ( isolating ) : considerably more compact and somewhat less expensive than the PXC 300 , these are also quite good . Bass can be very tubby ( that might be improved by stiffer custom inserts , but that would more than double the price ) Koss `` The Plug '' ( isolating ) : laughably innacurate . Buy these only if you have tin ears and a habit of losing small things on airplanes . Otherwise do yourself a favor and invest a bit more in one of the alternatives .	-1
Does n't have much range . This definitely decreased the volume in my headphones . It works as a volume control but it should n't decrease the volume to do so .	-1
Seriously , are these airplane headphones ? That 's how poor I found the sound quality in these . I was shocked after seeing all the great reviews for these and then after finally checking them out for myself , wow , what a let down . They do look cool but even the $ 5 Skullcandy earbuds with poor sound quality sounds better than these . I can not believe this is Koss , I have owned numerous headphones by them but this is just sad .	-1
Based on all the reviews I thought this was going to be a nice set of cans . Unfortunately I 'm very disappointed . I 'm comparing them to the Sony MDR-V6 , which in my opinion rates against headphones in the $ 200+ price range.The PortaPro is not a bad headphone , but its not a good headphone either . The bass is present but muddy . Not clear or crisp at all . The mids have a decent amount of detail but the muddy bass bleeds the mids out quite a bit . And the treble ... . where is it ? I have n't heard a headphone with less treble . This lack of treble futher leads to the overall lack of detail and excitement found in other headphones . Are they worth the $ 25 that I paid ? Yes . But I would n't pay more than that for them . Save up and buy the ~ $ 67 Sony MDR-V6 , its several tiers above the PortaPro , not only in sound quality , but in noise isolation and build quality . If you can afford the Sennheiser HD598 , I also very very highly recommend them as well .	-1
My girlfriend only had these for like two weeks and they just fell apart on her all of a sudden .	-1
Total junk . Installer shut down , forcing a manual installation . Image is grainy , regardless of settings , colors are n't right . Horrible , avoid .	-1
I 'm wearing my headphones now listening to music on my laptop , which is good . The bad news is that my right earpiece is attached with shoe-goo because it broke and there was not enough surface area to just glue the stem piece . That is to say , the whole earpiece is glued solid to its bracket so it does n't move . The over-the-head thing is taped together with packaging tap because it , too , broke when I put the things on my rather large head . They sound fine and all , but I could make a more durable headphone set out of balsa wood . Do not consider these things portable unless your bodyguard is willing to carry them in a padded suitcase.Maybe I should just glue to the earpieces to my head .	-1
After owning these headphones for over 6 months I can tell you that they just do n't compare at all to the Sony MDR-V6 model . The overall sound quality is muddy , flat , and lifeless . The bass tone these cans produce is more of an upper mid-bass rather than a smooth , tight , and deep bass . The mid-range sounds are muddy and offer very little ambient presence to the sound . Highs are more harsh sounding rather than clean and precise . If you 're buying these mainly to listen to music I 'd suggest you look elsewhere as these sound pretty bad . I currently use the Sony V6s ( not the V600s ) for listening to music and some studio work and the difference between them is quite dramatic.The build quality and comfort of the Sony MDR-V600 is about all that is good about them . But , if you want something that sounds accurate for studio monitoring than get the classic Sony MDR-V6 model ( many studios and radio stations use the Sony MDR-V6 or the Sony MDR-7506 headphones for monitoring sound ) . They fold up just like the MDR-V600s and are just as comfortable.If sound quality is important to you then avoid the Sony MDR-V600 headphones like the plague . They 're horrible .	-1
My first pair lasted 16 years . Somewhere along the line , Sony decided to make the plastic film covering the ear pads thinner , that they would wear out after a year or so and need replacing . Most of their headphones are designed this way . After a few months , the ear pads come apart at the seams . Within a year , bits of black plastic will begin to tear off and stick to your face . Within two years , the ear pads will be completely shredded.These are low-quality , overpriced headphones . You will do better with other brands .	-1
I work from home and use my home phone at least 3 to 4 hours a day . I have Panasonic and have used Panasonic headsets previously . After I cycled through two of them , I decided to give this one a try . I just got it in the mail and it has 3.5 mm jack . My home phone takes 2.5mm jack . There is no information in the product description about the headset jack size so I relied on some of the reviews where people used it successfully for home phone . I also had someone comment that they also received a jack adapter 3.5 to 2.5 mm . I did not get that so this is useless for me.I will be contacting the vendor for a return . Disappointing !	-1
Awkward to use and the pieces were difficult to put together ( the padded ear cushion would NOT go on ... and no instructions were provided ) . Uncomfortable on my head and basically more trouble than it was worth . Will keep trying to find a good & # 34 ; plug-in & # 34 ; headset for my iPhone as an alternate to bluetooth . My biggest problem was that it was n't clear from the description that I HAD TO ALSO ORDER the 2.5 - 3.5 adapter in order for the plug to work with my iPhone 4 . Went all over trying to find such an item to no avail ( even Best Buy did n't carry anything ) . Trying to return it .	-1
Excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound . I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also , just FYI , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions . Not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .	-1
you sent me the wrong item . the item you sent me was suppose to go to MR. FELIZ BIRDI . WROONG ITEM/i really do n't know what your going to do .	-1
USB Cable was dead on arrival . Not cool considering I ran it through a wall.Today 's lesson : Test your cords before running them .	-1
I connect a USB item to these cables and , maybe , % 25 of the time it works . I have to fiddle with it to really get any connection . I have older , worn out cables that work better than these .	-1
This cable is advertised as having `` 480 Mbps transmission speed '' which is false . On the packaging it says only 12 Mbps , meaning this is NOT a USB 2.0 cable . Be careful ! I would have left one star but thankfully Amazon let me return the cable without any hassle .	-1
It was great out of the box . Within about 6 months the center plug somehow got bent inside so I ca n't plug anything into that one anymore . After 10 months the lock stopped working so when it 's extended I have to put something on the cord to keep it from reeling back in . I should also add at this point the cord may have been pulled out a couple dozen times at most.Update - I opened it up today to see if I could get the lock to work again . Turns out there are 2 plastic cogs that work together and one is mounted on a rivet . It had gotten a little bit bent so straightening it out seems to have fixed the problem . I also cranked the spring up another revolution so it retracts a little more forcefully and all the way to the end . Easy repair with a screwdriver and pair of pliers .	-1
I 've had a 909 for 10 years . It 's gotten several thousand hours of use , has fallen on the floor a few times , and is still going strong.It 's very true that this radio is hard of hearing using its whip antenna . It has inferior sensitivity . I just bought a $ 20 analog SW radio which is vastly more sensitive . You must add your own external antenna . The reel antenna will do nicely . After that , the 909 truly performs . It can hear everything then.The speaker is also poor . It has inferior sound . Again , the $ 20 analog I bought has vastly superior sound to the 909 . The sound on the 909 is disappointing . I only ever listen to it using headphones.The 909 has a tuning knob , which is much better than up/down buttons for tuning . You can tune in 1 KHz increments . That 's fine for SW.The narrow/wide filters are okay . Not great . Using the narrow filter and tuning away from an interfering station can help with the interference.The tuning for SSB is unacceptable . SSB should not sound like Donald Duck in a radio with this price . If you rip off the display glass , you can adjust the BFO screw and almost get SSB to zero-beat . I prefer the BFO knob on the YB 400PE to what the 909 has . Poor SSB performer.The sound mutes when you tune . That is bad . I ripped my radio apart and modded the radio so it would not mute.The radio frequently beeps when you press buttons . This is annoying . I ripped my radio apart and removed the beep speaker.The memory function is very nice . Nearly 30 pages of 9 memories each . Most of them are preprogrammed and out of date . You have to find a cheat online to bypass the memory lock so you can store your own countries and frequencies.Decent FM and MW reception . MW DXers will not be disappointed.No DRM . This is an old radio . If you want DRM , you need to do another mod , buy a mixer/filter chip , pipe the signal into your computer , and decode it with the appropriate software.No synchronous detection . At this price , the radio really should have had sync . It makes a huge difference in terms of listenability . Sync completely removes adjacent interference and fading distortion . If you listen to SW you want it . The 909 does n't have it.I like the 909 . But I must suggest you get the Sony ICF-SW7600GR instead . It is much cheaper . It has much better sensitivity . It has much better sound . It has synchronous detection . Or if your focus is SSB , get the Grundig Yacht Boy 400PE . It is cheaper , has better sound , and zero-beats SSB.Sorry 909-lovers , but your radio is greatly outclassed by the competition .	-1
I 'm revising my rating downward after failing to get my printer to operate consistently with this hub despite its bulky and heavy-duty power supply . When I switched to a lighter Asante 4-port hub , I no longer had any problems . Maybe the problem was in my USB cable , because the D-Link seems to be a solid , well-designed piece of equipment . The price is right , so you could do worse than give it a try for yourself.The D-Link hub initially worked fine with my iMac for lighter tasks . But as Harry Carey would say whenever a fly ball fell short of the bleachers , one more biscuit for breakfast might have insured a home run . Lately I 'm finding that heavy-duty print jobs involving photos are requiring me to unplug the printer from the hub and directly into the USB port of the computer . Occasionally , the unit causes everything to freeze when attached to its power supply , then resumes functionality when I unplug its electrical source ( the instructions claim the unit is 5 times more powerful when run by electricity ) . Fortunately , at these prices you can afford to just toss it and try something else .	-1
This antenna did not work at all . The only good thing I can say is that is was cheap enough that I did n't go to the bother of sending it back , just into the trash .	-1
Worst Drives Ever ! Had 3 fail already none due to excessive heat or impact . The WD drives I purchased at the same time are still going strong . Buy what you 'd like but I 'm sticking with WD .	-1
stay away look for updates in other reviews for failures.Pros : Works fine until it dies ! Cons : I have had 3 failures of this model disk in the last 45 days in 2 different systems . These were not gamer systems and are well cooled in large Antec boxes . Clearly Seagate has a problem and expect additional failures - next time I will put the service / shipping charges towards Western Digital units rather than replacing junk with junk.Cons : ... died without any warning after two months.The return policy is horrible - you are literally not allowed to use packing peanuts , bubble wrap , or newspaper to package a dead drive when you return it for warranty replacement . It has to be 2 inches of foam rubber in a corugated box or your warranty is void.Also , you are sent a REFURBISHED drive as a replacement.You are also required to pay for shipping the drive back , and can wait as long as 30 days from the day they receive it to get your new one.This last point is n't too bad in itself , but when mixed with everything else , it 's stupid.Oh , and the RMA form on the website was down for two or three days before I could actually get it sent in . Customer service could n't even fill out an RMA request for me - the entire system was down for `` maintenance '' .They also make sure to withhold the detail about packing until you already submitted the form ... and possibly gave them $ 20 to avoid waiting a month for your replacemeOther Thoughts : What happened , Seagate ? I have two more of the older 7200.10 drives in here and they 've run absolutely beautifully for the year I 've had them - as a matter of fact , they 're the only thing holding my degraded RAID5 up right now . I still have the old 160GB drive that came with my Dell five years back , and it still works like a charm . I order a couple 7200.11 drives , one arrives DOA and the other dies within two months without any warning.Cons : Had a SD15 failure . Drive was making a high-pitched noise just before it failed on machine reboot . Was able ( with effort ) to get SD1A flashed onto drive . But then drive became very noisy -- every few seconds , it would sound like the head was tracking accross the drive ( a 'farting ' noise , as some have said ) . Performance would also drop to near zero at these times.Got a warranty replacement from Seagate ( which cost me $ 20 ) -- another drive with SD15 ! Sure enough , one week after install this one just started to make the high-pitched noise , so I 'm typing this before I 'm computerless once again.Other Thoughts : I will never , EVER buy Seagate again . I will do everything I can to make sure no one I know buys their products , either . Shame , shame , shame on you , Seagate .	-1
I 'm disappointed to report that my unit blew out after a few days of modest use . It was plugged-into a standard 220-volt outlet in a UK hotel . But it overheated witin 15 minutes and had to be shut down frequently . Now I am using a Tacima step-down transformer . Look into the Proctor-SIlex model as well . This Recoton could n't handle the job , and I was using the 50-watt setting .	-1
It lasted only 2 months , that 's pretty bad for a Router/switch . See if i can get a refund for it . My D-link lasted 5 yrs .	-1
Junk , Only one ethernet port worked . Tech support sucked . Will stay away from net gear . Purchased a china model for 10.00 cheaper and it works great .	-1
Could n't find anyplace else on Amazon to review the Dymo Letra Tags . I am probably returning both models that I purchased . The more expensive model ( QX50 ) has a Qwerty keyboard , but prints horribly , if at all . On a single line of bold text , it printed just about nothing . It prints 2-lines of normal text , with contrast set at the highest level , very irregularly . You can see some letters but not others . This is supposed to be their newer model . The next level down ( a few bucks less ) looks more like a calculator in it 's design ; long and narrow ( N10926 ? ) . It prints really well ; very crisp letters even just at regular contrast . Unfortunately in 2-line mode it will not center the lines , has less symbols ( I need inch marks ) , and requires 6 batteries to the other model 's 5 . ( Perhaps the extra power makes it print better though ? ) I 'm pretty disappointed . The tapes are much more expensive than the old emobossed wheel gun models they make . LetraTag tapes provide only 13 feet of tape . I wanted to make labels for my garden stakes . I 'm going to take a look at the Brother and Casio lines of label makers and hope there 's something better .	-1
I 've used both Replay and their competitor Tivo , and I have to say I 'm much happier with Tivo . For one thing , Replay included Firewire ports on their original unit which they marketed as being available for adding external hard drives . After a year the software still does n't support them and they ca n't say when it will ! I 've also been bitten by quite a few software bugs and find their management mechanism for recorded programs to be byzantine and often surprising . I 've had the unit delete a program I was watching in order to record the latest episode when it had plenty of space and was supposed to keep several episodes of the program . Also , several times I 've gone to watch recorded programs and found that the unit had crashed.Also , if you change recording characteristics for a show ( number of episodes to store , quality , etc ) , Replay deletes your currently recorded episodes ! I 've also had Tivo crash , but only while I was actively using it . Tivo has never failed to record a program for me , and I 've found their interface for managing what to be intuitive and easy to use . Some of Tivo 's programming guides are poorly designed , though.The live pause feature of both Replay and Tivo is wonderful , and Tivo is limited to 30 minutes whereas Replay is limited by the amount of available space ( usually much more than 30 minutes ) .Also , be aware that the quoted times for both Replay and Tivo are for lowest quality recording . You 'll probably find that the lowest quality is TOO low and that you 'll want to use the next best quality , probably halving the available record time.In short , Replay should spending their energy on getting existing products to work reliably , and on supporting features they promised a year ago , rather than introducing new products .	-1
Within a month of purchase , 2 of the 5 channels on this switch were dead . This is unacceptable quality control on such a simple device .	-1
If you buy this product you better pray it works . I purchased this product and it did n't work , sent it back to Amazon to get replaced . Then it still did n't work.You might think that it was my setup but tech support has confirmed that it was n't , and that this is the 2nd 'faulty ' switch . However they have failed to send me an RMA number to send it back to them . I have called every day for the past 2 weeks to try and obtain this elusive 'RMA confirmation email'.As of right now their tech support/customer service 800 number is n't even working or is overloaded.If you buy this product , I hope it works for you . But if you think you might need some service from the company , you may want to think about going to a competitor ( are there any in this price range ? ) .	-1

I really liked this card until I bought a Netgear FS108 10/100 switch . No matter how I configured the LNE100TX card , it would only talk to the switch if I forced it to 10mbps mode . Forcing to 100Mbps would n't work , nor would autonegotiation.If I wanted a 10Mbps card , I would have gotten one . This is a poor performer .	-1
Skip this digital camera and go directly to the Coolpix 880 by Nikon ( also on Amazon ) . Why , you ask ? Well , this Coolpix is quite old ( in terms of digital ) and you 'll be throwing your good money after a badly outdated camera . Here are the details why : Megapixels . The Coolpix 800 takes 2.1 megapixel pictures , but the 880 take 3.1 megapixel . ( More pixels are preferred to less since this will affect your image quality . ANd believe me - you will SEE the difference ! ) Zoom . The 800 has a 2x optical , plus 2.5 digital zoom lens ; however , the 880 has a 2.5x optical and the digital zoom . You always want as high an optical zoom because using pure digital zoom will make your pictures look fuzzy ! Memory . Both the 800 and 880 come with 8 MB of CompactFlash , but most people would agree that this is n't enough . Purchase an additional CompactFLash card for 32 MB or more and you 'll be happy you did.Downloading . The 800 only connects via serial port , but the 880 connects via serial OR USB . THe USB connection is MUCH MUCH faster for downloading pics to yoru computer , but the serial ( 800 's only method ) is horrendously slow.Batteries . THe 800 uses 4 AA batteries , but the 880 uses far superior and much longer-lasting 2CR5 lithium batteries . The 880 's batteries also weigh less.Price . This is the ONLY reason you shoudl consider the 800 ( $ 499 ) over the 880 ( $ 699 ) . But let 's face it , if you have $ 499 for the 800 , you should fork over the extra $ 200 and get the 880 so you can have a digital camera that will last you more than a year . The 800 is being phased out by Nikon . RUN to the 880 today ! : )	-1
Failed after two months of use while only having a 42 inch tv plugged into it . Inferior monster product . I would n't buy again . It seemed a good price for the item but not worth the headache .	-1
Looks and feels nice , but broke after two weeks . I used it for rather high power appliances ( 3kW total ) though .	-1
I 've used Monster surge protectors in the past and had no reason to complain but when put to the test , this one totally failed me . This is your basic surge protector strip , with right angle plug and color-coded plugs for various audio-visual components . But does it give them sufficient protection ? Unfortunately it did not for me . I was using it for my Tivo-TV combination and a bad storm one day fried the hard drive in my Tivo . So dock a few stars for it failing to properly protect my device . So now I get to experience this Monster warranty process . Suffice to say , you will be lucky if you get anything out of them , or can fulfill the requirements and 3 pages of information they want you to send them . In my case , I have a Tivo DVD that no one within several hundred miles of me is `` authorized '' to repair as they require , and they require an inspection of the damaged equipment by such a technician prior to filing a claim . I have to order a replacement part on the internet , which they do n't accept and they wo n't reimburse after the fact . You also have to pay to send the surge protector back to them for inspection as well , so basically you have to spend a significant amount of money to file a claim and may get absolutely nothing out of it . So basically , the warranty in a lot of cases is of little use and not worth the trouble they put you through versus just paying for repairs yourself . So you can dock another star or two for that . So while I like the design of this surge protector , I probably will go looking for another one that will properly protect my equipment at least .	-1
I do n't know how Monster charges these prices with a straight face . My cable guy said `` we do n't use these '' -- `` not recommended '' -- `` does not improve reception '' . My cable company uses standard , red-labeled , lower cost , 5-1000mhz splitters . They work just fine !	-1
In my first review a failed to mention what systems and software I was running . I believe this may be the cause of many people 's woes ... I run these cards on 3 very different systems : 1 ) AMD athlon 1ghz biostar mb 2 ) Intel p90 `` Micron '' who knows what kind of mb 3 ) Intel p133 `` Gateway '' ditto on the mbBut , for all three , I am running windows 98se ( second edition ) .I believe the determining factor in getting your PC 's to talk to each other using this device and provided drivers is having the same operating system on each platform.As I recall , during software installation for the Netgear cards , I was required to `` insert the windows installation CD '' for the complete software installation . As the Netgear software relies on windows networking software this is key to getting these things working . There are a lot of differences between windows95 , windows98 , and windowsME , especially in the area of networking.Netgear 's installation should overcome these differences , or at least document the problems . For this I am downgrading my rating to only 2 stars ...	-1
They do n't last half as long for me as they are advertised which is all i can say . I have used them in digital cameras and dslr camera equipment .	-1
I highly recommend NOT getting this unit . The Garmin unit does n't work well enough to do anything with . I 'm up high on a mountain with great sky coverage , lots of satellite lock in , awful inaccuracy . Waste of money .	-1
This is a bad CompactFlash Card . Compare with Viking ( I bought two from an internet store because it should be the best one ) , SimpleTech , Microtech , 128MB Compact Flash Card . SanDisk CompactFlash Card read and write speeds are so bad . I use CANON PRO70 and CANON D60 camera , which have RAW format . SanDisk CompactFlash take twice time to read and write data . Even the newest SanDisk Ultra CompactFlash does n't work faster than others . However , its price is so high.You could get full test review on-line.If you use basic digital camera with below 2.0 megapixels resolution and save with JPG format , it is ok for you with 128MB . Otherwise , please do n't buy this one . Choosing other company 's CompactFlash is better for you .	-1
I used this 128MB Sandisk CF card with my Nikon 885 digital camera on a recent trip to Vietnam . While it does store plenty of high quality images , the issue I have with this card is the read/write rate . As the card fills up with pictures it becomes slow to store the picture you just took . I estimate that this took up to 15 seconds , an eternity while waiting to take another picture . Even more painful is reviewing and deleting pictures . Going through thumbnails of about 100 pictures took 5-10 minutes as the camera struggled to read from the memory card . I also took along a Lexar 16MB 8X card that displayed my pictures almost instantaneously . This is a lower capacity card but it gave me a comparison . Sandisk does n't do a very good job of stating its read/write speeds . These speeds ( along with # of MBs ) is what distinguishes mainstream from professional quality cards . Professional photographers do n't have time to wait to take another picture or review their older pictures . I am buying a large capacity Lexar 12X card to be my primary high storage card and the Sandisk card will be my backup for overflow situations .	-1
! ! ! ! BUY A MAXTOR AT YOUR OWN PERIL ! ! ! I have a Dell 1Gig , 512 machine , with the Maxtor 40G hard-drive as part of the initial build . Less than two weeks after my machine came off Warranty , the drive failed , completely and utterly.In breaking down my box , I found that the warranty was marked on the outside of the HD as `` aug 03 '' ( it 's presently jul 03 ) . So I called Maxtor . They claimed the HD warranty ended in May 03 . The rep asked me to `` send proof '' , which after some further discussion was a fax sent to Maxtor ( which I had to send 3 times ) . After getting Maxtor support to help for about 15 minutes , they suddenly said , `` this drive was OEM 'd by Dell and as such you have to deal with them . '' When I pointed out that the warranty was still good according to the HD , I was handed around and eventually told , `` tough luck '' .I 'm going to try my luck with Western Digital .	-1
I own two such drives . Both failed in less then two years , one completely , the second one still works if mounted & quot ; upside down & quot ; ( otherwise the motor can not start ) . I think there are some motor reliability problem with this particular drive and it is more common that one can assume from the posts or WEB research . May be similar to IBM 's problems , but I may just have a bad luck . I also own 4 I Western Digital drives with 8MB cache and they all are still alive . Again this might be a coincidence , but please be careful before buying this drive , especially as a replacement .	-1
This thing is a dinosaur at this point . Are they even selling it ? I would n't waste my money on it .	-1
I do n't understand how these get more than one star.They are poorly constructed and I could n't get them to focus.Believe me , I 'm not a binocular snob , these are crap . The knob sticks , they feel cheap and the image is poor.They should be putting these in cereal boxes . Seriously , they are not worth the effort of ordering and carrying around your neck.I sent them back .	-1
Within days of receiving this product , the rubber around the eye piece fell off . Not a big deal , but annoying nonetheless . The quality of the optics of the binoculars leaves much to be desired , but of course , that is a function of the price . In humid and wet conditions the binoculars just did not hold up . The lenses were always fogged and then a permanent cloud settled in the lenses , making them almost useless . I just left them somewhere when I was traveling . On the plus side , they are small , light and convenient to carry around . Would not buy again , even though they are inexpensive , it just is n't worth the $ 20-30 that I spent on it . If casual birding in your backyard is all you will be doing with these , this is the product for you . Otherwise , do n't bother .	-1
I ordered two of these to keep in the car . One of them had to be returned as it was out of alignment and resulted in vertical double vision . Not very good quality control . The one that worked was fine but I gave them two stars to call attention to the bad one and warn customers to check them carefully on arrival .	-1
Not having done my homework , and knowing nothing about binoculars , I mistakenly expected a higher magnification to be better - not ! Using these 16 x 32 binoculars is like viewing through lenses held by someone with Parkinson 's Disease - very shaky ! I kept checking my hands - which did n't feel shaky at all - to make sure they were n't actually shaking , and they were n't . Later I read that binoculars with higher magnification produce very shaky images unless the binoculars are held still as with a tripod.Worse , you have to constantly adjust these if you try to view to the left , right , towards you , or farther away . In short , a pain in the butt . I get eye strain and headaches after just a minute or 2 of using these . A waste of money . No , I wo n't buy a tripod ; I bought these because they were cheap and because I did n't want to spend much money for the limited viewing I 'd be ( hopefully ) doing . I ordered a pair of 10 x 50 , and will see how they work out ... .	-1
Very convenient to use , nice focusing , rubber eye cups , but you get what you pay for . Binocular users do n't usually realize what they 're missing until they check out Nikon or Minolta binocs . The images focus into crystal clarity but the price is close to a hundred or more bucks . But it 's like a digital camera . It does n't matter what the features are if the images are crappy.The lenses in these binocs have rings around the inner perimeter that are always out of focus . The center image is pretty good until you compare it with better binoculars , then there are more colors , a brighter image and , of course , consequently , greater viewing pleasure.Also , like most lens caps on binoculars , the lens caps on these should be discarded with the plastic wrap and box . They fall off with gravity and you 'll soon lose them anyway.This one 's a good model for kids . For yourself , use your tax cut and buy a more expensive model . If you 're going to walk 12 miles into the woods , you deserve to have primo optics .	-1
Received these today . Made sure the interpupillary distance and the diopter were set correctly and the binoculars still produced a double image . The factory seals on the package indicate these were not previously returned or tampered with . They either slipped past quality control , or were somehow knocked out of alignment during shipping.Binoculars that ca n't handle a 2 day trip in shipping are n't durable enough for field use , and if they left the factory like that , QC needs to be more vigilant . In any case they are unusable in this condition.It 's a shame because they otherwise appear to be good build quality . The fit and finish was nice . But I need to look through them , not just look at them .	-1
I have owned this unit for six months . Everything was fine until I built a new PC and attempted to set the PPPoE for the new PC . After accessing the Setup Menu and making the necessary changes , everytime I hit `` Save '' I would get the logon/password window , and could n't get past it.Multiple calls to Linksys Tech Support were routed to India , where I was repeatedly instucted to uselessly reset the modem . Finally , they told me to RMA the unit . I was not happy when I discovered I was required to pay for the return shipping of the suspect unit , even though my unit was still under warranty.The replacement unit arrived and I wired it up : SAME PROBLEM . Infuriated , I called again . The guy who answered listened to my description of the problem said `` I know how to fix that '' , and had me make one change in Windows : VOILA , it worked.Now I had to return the unnecessary replacement router , again , on my nickel . When I expressed my frustration with all the previous CS reps who did n't know the solution , here 's the really funny part : He asked me `` Were you talking to India ? '' Yes , I said , and he replied , `` The Indians are all idiots . We 're in the Philippines . Next time you have a problem , make sure you 're talking to the Philippines . `` Well , there you have it : The Third World at war with itself for America 's hearts and minds . Linksys corporate should be proud . SHEEEEESH !	-1
This router seems to have problems creating connections . As long as a computer stays up and connected , everything seems ok . However , upon computer reboot it may take several tries to obtain a connection from this router . Tried updating the firmware since the firmware was out-of-date but because of bad documentation and a clunky update method the router was temporarily & # 34 ; bricked & # 34 ; . Thank gawd others with the same router posted remedies online ( see ? The process & # 34 ; bit & # 34 ; other folks too ) and after a very painful half-day of work the router was back . Original problem was not fixed , however .	-1
Bought this to replace a D-Link router that is getting flaky and spent an entire frustrating afternoon with it . IP obtained , no network capability . Updated the firmware even , no help . The website offered advice on resolving that in no way matched any software either available on the website , or the software that came with the product . Finally I plugged back in my D-Link and am temporarily back in business - will look elsewhere for a solution . At least the D-link came with understandable software and a website that is comprehensible .	-1
I read reviews ( but not on usenet ) about how great this router was - but when I started using it with my linux and windows 98SE boxes attached to an @ home cable modem , I noticed that EVERY ftp download and every other image had checksum errors . Very odd - in my 20 years of BBS/Cerfnet/Internet experience , I had NEVER seen CRC corruption issues.The user experience was that ftp was COMPLETELY broken , and that every fifth image on a webpage would look like noise.Linksys has a firmware upgrade - and even after applying the thing , I still have connection refused issues and corrupt downloads that mysteriously go away when I take the router out of the picture . Terrible.I returned mine and got a NetGear router . Make sure you do some usenet research - or be prepared to take it back - this seems to be a common problem with this router - it even refers to the corruption problems in the & quot ; Frequently Asked Questions & quot ; that came with the thing . It tells you to use a different ftp client - hah ! - as if that would fix their hardware issue ! Oh well . Viva la competition .	-1
Yes , this router is easy to use , setup and does exactly what you would expect . However , it 's disposable . Expect to buy another one within a 2-3 years . After just over 2 years , mine died ( it only came with a 1 year warrenty ) . While it still works , I have to reset it by unplugging it and then plugging it back in several times a day ( like 10-20 ) . Then you have to wait about a minute for all the computers to deal with the reset . This sort of disposable lifespan seems pretty par for the course for Linksys consumer products.I was gullible enough to replace my first with a second ( like I said they are cheap and cheap ) . The second has lasted longer but every time the house power goes out I have to reset the router using Linksys ' Netset utility which means physically connecting a computer directly to the router - which is a pain for me since I keep it in a closet next to my patch panel . Netset works fine except it is Windows only . So , Linksys are not Mac friendly ( though Macs will work with their products ) .So this is my last Linksys product . I replace my Linksys wireless AP with an Apple Airport Extreme - much more stable.So in short , with Linksys - you get what you pay for - they are cheap and cheap .	-1
Two reasons I bought this : 1 . To move all my computers behind a router so I would n't have to leave one on all the time ; and 2. to be able to handle inbound FTP connections to my FTP server . The router functioned acceptably for basic functions ( easy to configure , etc . ) , but inbound FTP connections would consistently fail after transfering a few thousand bytes . Each failure would require that the router be reset.This item is probably OK for most people , but it could n't handle the one primary thing that I needed , hence the low rating . It 's now running as a replacement for my old hub ( also a LinkSys ) which has an overheating problem . You 'd think I 'd learn ...	-1
I returned this item because I could not get it to work with my computer . However to be a refurbished item , it looked practically new . No problem returning it .	-1
What they do n't tell you is that the item works with very limited OS systems and there has n't been a firmware update forever to accommodate newer OS . Sent this back right away .	-1
I had a poor experience with Sennheiser as a company . I received a pair of HD 265 's . These are not inexpensive headphones and wanted closed not open headphones . I unpacked the product and put them to my ears and they broke in half . I had a piece of headphone in each hand . I called the seller and they said send them bak to the manufacturer . Nothing like like making the customer responsible for a problem . I sent them back to Sennheiser and asked if I could upgrade to a better headphone such as the 600 's and that I would be happy to pay . I have to give Sennheiser credit . They did call and offer to uprgrade for $ 250 plus the HD 265 . I explained that I could get a pair of 600 's on Amazon for less than that and keep the 265 's . That did not seem to matter to them . I guess they could not follow the logic of pay more and get less.My suggestion is to stay away from Sennheiser alltogether and take a look at Ultrasone , GRADO , or Pioneer.Unlike the Ultrasone 's these headphones the 600 's have an in your head sound as opposed to the much more natural sounding and accurate Ultrasone 's . These headphones are also very tight and uncomfortable and connot be worn for long.Although I own a pair of Sennheiser noise cancelling headphones which I like , I prefer to give business to a company with more character . I also think there are headphones with a much superior build quality and superior sound such as the Ultrasone and GRADO headphones . When it comes to reviews most people purchase headphones and do not compare and write a review about the only headpohone they have really listened to . The initial impression of most quality headphones is mindblowing . That was my initial mistake . Now I have experiences GRADO 's Ultrasone 's and STAX 's . Save your money and do n't buy a name , buy a headphone .	-1
I bought this cause I needed something fast and did n't want to spend a lot of money . The unit ok ok . It eats batteries fast and picture quality is mediocre at best . I should have ponied up the cash for a better camera .	-1
Bought two of these cameras to take photos for insurance purposes . There was no flash when I took the photos , so when I called the company they confirmed that was correct . When I took another shot , there was a flash . Needless to say , nothing came out . Can anyone recommend a digital ?	-1
I have had this unit ( DI-701 ) for a year or so and recently found a problem in addition to the security hole thats posted here.I upgraded to the newest firmware 4.10 because I needed the IPSec protocol that the 4.06 didnt have and it seems to work fine until I tried to access Netflix.com . The unit totally halts . All lights stay on and the unit can not be found through its configurator . I have to recycle the power to the unit to get it back up and running again.I called tech support and they told me to call Netflix and ask them what ports they are using to send back http requests . I told him that Netflix didnt have a tech support since they do not provide hardware . And it should n't be the case since I was able to access Netflix with the 4.06 firmware . Who knows what other site it can not access . So to the recycling bin it goes !	-1
my onboard LAN went out on a gigabyte motherbaord . darn right ? the way the connectors go , the metal outside would have to be inside let alone go through my motherboard before it would connect . I of course sat there trying to figure it out , and realized it would n't work so I gave my UPS uncle the package with a return label and sent it back . I would not recommend this unless your motherboard is upside down , where the smaller part of the pci port is closer to the outside of the shell	-1
D-Link makes low-end NIC 's . My problem with them is why they 're made so awfully . Quality is so inconsistent . Their help desk is indifferent to the card 's many installation problems . D-Link 's diagnostics work only in DOS ( ? ) .Skip this one ...	-1
A thousand versions of MP3 and Ipod type players . Numerous small radios that you must listen thru earpieces and not thru speakers . Why is it that not a single manufacturer can build a small pocket radio that has a digital tuner and direct tuning push button presets as in your automobile . Radio Shack built a couple of version some 5 to 10 years ago and they were excellent . I have had 3 or 4 of them but all have now broken and RS no longer offers ( they do offer a rather miserable version that has presets but you must scan thru all presets to get to the station you wish ) . Could you imagine doing that on your television set with some 2 hundred channels ? This seems such an obvious product instead of the 1001st version of another MP3 player . There are those who carry a radio in their pockets when walking ( think postmen ) , going to the beach , working , hiking , camping etc . This is a natural and yet no one builds such a unit that I can find . Again Radio Shack had such a unit some years ago ( a couple of models -- I would suggest a couple of ergonomic improvements but on the whole they were excellent and some bean counter at RS decided to no longer offer them ) . Sony has such a unit , but you can only listen via an earphone ( not thru a speaker ) . Someone once told me that the key to business success was always to know what the chikens are eating .	-1
The sound is just fair - Cheap Sony headphones sound much better . And despite purchasing these through Amazon Prime , the seller was going to let me return them after I paid shipping and reshelfing fees , which together added up to more than the headphones . I had purchased two sets and this return applied to only the unopened set . Now I have two worthless headphones .	-1
I dont do well with headphones they irritate my ears . I itch when I use them so , if you dont have that problem then order these . For the price your cant go wrong . For the kiddies they are a bit too cheap and wont hold up under the hard useage .	-1
I bought my first set of these in June , 2010 for $ 4.27 . Great price for the sound quality . Ten months later , for no discernible reason , the left earpiece went out.OK , I figured , they were only $ 4.27 - besides , perhaps I did something to cause it ( unlikely , because I 'm gentle with my electronics ) .So , I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $ 4.80 ( tax this time , doncha know ) . This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you do n't mind replacing these every 6-10 months ( that 's my experience , anyway ) , these are a great budget pair of headphones : they sound good , and are comfortable . I 'd prefer to pay double , or even triple , the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way ? ! It 's bad for the environment , and it 's inconvenient for me .	-1
I returned this because the headphone jack did n't connect well with my samsung smart phone . I use the phone with several other sets of headphones and do n't have this problem with any of them . If I compare the plug with the other headphones that work I ca n't see a difference so I 'm assuming that it 's minor but enough to cause a problem .	-1
I bought these headphones for use with my iPod . While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage , I do n't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily . I figured five bucks , good reviews , worth a shot.These headphones sound bad . I do know these are quite cheap , but I 've still heard better even for this price . The problem is the sound is plain tinny . Even with some equalization in the mix , I could n't get `` good bass '' or a full sound out of these . Also the midranges , specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced . Another issue is the volume . I have to crank up about 70 % of my recievers volume for moderate volume , and the iPod is even worse . Yes , they are cheap and comfy , but they sound as good as they cost . I 've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones ( MDRA110 ) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better .	-1
I bought two sets about six months ago because they were cheap . While the sound is good , the fit is terrible . Both failed within four months -- likely due to stress on the cords . They also do n't have a volume control and they are not good for television watching , if that 's what you had in mind . I believe they are under warranty , but at this price , it 's not worth the postage to send them to Sony .	-1
When I first received these glasses , I was happy ... lite and perfect ... but , they never aligned properly ... I had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other ... I have to give full credit to Amazon ... they immediately gave me a credit and I purchased the Barska Gladiators which I love ... and they showed up the next day ! ! ! ! !	-1
I really wanted to like this Jornada . But when I got it it just did n't feel right in my hand . The cover - which apparently others like - I hated it . The requirement to store the stylus in the cover is okay , but when you do n't use the cover and put it in a pack or case there is no where to store the stylus - that can be a problem.The screen is not as bright as I had hoped . I am new to Windows based handhelds , but in PocketPC OS it is EXTREMELY difficult to shut down an application , and when you get 10 or so different things running it gets SLOOOOOOOW.HP usually turns out intuitively designed products , but the wheel for scrolling is useless due to its placement . The aforementioned placement of the stylus holder was an issue , and then comes my biggest complaint : the CF slot cover . This little flimsy piece of plastic which is designed to cover the empty ( or full ) CF slot , but it is very cheaply made and poorly attached - I gave it about a week before it would have broken off ; and its placement was such that I hit it all the time.The multimedia was fair , mp3 files sounded good with or without the headphones , but the player ... [ is poor ] and I never could get any sort of avi or mpeg video files to play as indicated . Even with USB connection , it took forever to download mp3s to the 548.COST - VERY EXPENSIVE ! For that price it should be manufactured with better materials.There are virtuosly no accessories for it . An external keyboard is nonexistant . There are two companies with ads in the Accessory guide who show external keyboards , but upon further checking - neither makes one for the 540 series of Jornadas.If you want to really be efficient , I would reccomend the HP Jornada 690 it has the same memory with better battery life , an internal modem , a built in keyboard and more.It works as promised , but is n't as exciting or valuable as it claims . In time , I am sure there will be better accessories and programs , but for now - I 'll keep my paper organizer and pen , its faster , cheaper , and unlimited storage ! Palm organizers are simpler and , in most circumstances , better ; unless you NEED color and multimedia .	-1
I do n't believe that these batteries are fresh . They seem to arrive already weak from age drain or some other issue . For the price they are not even as good as the readily-avilable AA 's .	-1
This is more a review of the seller than of the product . I ordered from Best Deal Supply and the battery was not only different from what was pictured ( it was a different Energizer CRV3 ) it was loose in a paper bag so I had no way to check the expiration on the battery . When I put it in the camera it seemed like it barely had enough juice to turn the camera on . This continues to be a problem , so I am guessing they sent a very expired battery . I have used the Emergizer Lithium Photo ( silver and blue one ) before , from other sellers , and they worked great , but the one 's being sold by Best Deal Supply are not a best deal , so just be careful which company is filling your order and you will probably be fine .	-1
I added these batteries to an order of a few other things , and did n't realize that they were going to ship this separately from Circuit city . Make sure if you pick this , that you are getting something else from CC , or else you will end up like me . With a huge box ( you could fit 4 Tom Clancey novels in the box ) shipped to you with a pack of batteries and end up paying more for shipping then you spend on the batteries !	-1
At first I bought this item it worked okay and was better then having to plug my camera in all the time , but after starting to conflict with other software it would lose contact with my computer after a couple uses . I would have to re-boot to re-establish contact . I ended up tossing this product . I recommend a Kodak reader for your Kodak cameras .	-1
Have used the Fine Pix for 8-months now.My PERSONAL experience with it : Pluses : Reliable , easy to operate , nice combination of features , small and handy ( but see below ) , battery life : ok for about 25-35 pictures.Minuses : Have to work hard to get sharp pictures - usually I do not succeed ; not really a 'pocket ' camera ; red-eye reduction never worked with my kids.Overall : If you can get it for $ 300 it is a good deal , current price of $ 500+ seems too expansive for what you get .	-1
I bought this lens on a killer clearance deal after missing an opportunity for some nice shots of a coyote . I just wanted a simple lens for an occasional wildlife snapshot . The image quality was so bad , I took it right back to the store . It is unlikely my expectations were too high , as I love my Rebel XTi ( 400D ) kit lens , which is considered one of Canon 's worst . I picked up a Tamron lens of similar focal length and have been reasonably happy with it . I 'd steer clear of this one unless you just want an SLR to look cool .	-1
This lens is cheap , and for a reason . It wo n't focus sharply when the aperture is wide open , so it 's hard to get shots with a narrow depth of field but sharp focus on the subject . Its high f-number means you pretty much need sunlight or a tripod to avoid camera shake , and forget about action shots unless it 's full sunlight . It also has very bad chromatic aberration ; this may be corrected by a UV filter , but I have n't tried it . It shows purple halos around dark objects when they 're set against a bright background.The lens does have very nice autofocus , though . It 's very fast , especially after it 's found the general distance of your subject and it just has to make minor corrections for different shots.Overall , this is a good lens for learning to frame shots and use a zoom lens , but its quality is low and it 's not good for much more than learning .	-1
I admittedly bought this in a bit of a hurry , as it was for a nearly-late birthday gift for my son , who had just moved into a new apartment and wanted a router for his new cable service . The reviews for this model sounded good - and I have another model from Linksys that works fine - so I took the bait . Bad decision ! If I 'd read the review dates more carefully , I 'd have noticed that most of them were many years old , going back to 2001 or earlier ! This I failed to do , however ( my bad , I know ) .I knew something was out of whack when I opened the sealed package , and discovered a layer of dust coating the top of the router . The included ethernet cable refused to plug into the back of the router - a bad cable end - so I replaced it with a cable of my own . Entering setup , I found a primitive UI and limited set of choices ; there was enough there , though to set it up for what he wanted . But it was all looking older and older . . . ! Unfortunately , the router would n't work right away , and after getting information from the cable company to no avail , we called Linksys support to get configuration help with our `` brand new '' router . We were told that it was out of warranty ! No , I said , it 's brand new ! Checking the model and serial numbers , the tech assured us that it was indeed well out of warranty and offered to provide support for a charge of $ 29.95We turned down that generous offer and figured the configuration out for ourselves . Properly configured , it has worked fine for the last week . But I call it unethical to fail to mention in the product description that the new product you are purchasing is NOT COVERED by the expected manufacturer 's warranty . Knowing that would have altered my buying decision.Prospective buyers , be aware that you will not be able to get support for this router without paying a fee - this thing has NO WARRANTY COVERAGE from the time you open the box . It may be new to you , but not to Linksys .	-1
I do not know why this thing got all those great ratings ; unfortunately I bought this on the strength of those reviews . It seems great when you set it up , but you will find it has the most annoying habit of losing the connection VERY frequently . If you have an always on broadband connection , do n't get this unless you just miss the old days of dialup and waiting to reconnect every time you want to get onto the Internet . It 's certainly the cheapest thing out there ; spend more and get something else ! Furthermore , Linksys tech support is non-existent ; they do not respond . I had decided to return this , only to find that my wife had just thrown away the box the day before and now I am stuck with it . I will wind up paying twice to replace this peice of trash . By the way , the next model up ( BEFSR14-4port ) has the same problem ( from what I have read of other reviews ) . If you still want to take a chance , just save the box and the receipt !	-1
I bought this 6 years ago but should have returned it immediately . Although I live in a large city the FM reception is practically non-existant . The antenna has to be set just right to pick up the strongest station in town , but even that dissolves in interference when a person or pet walks across the room or a car goes down the street . I 've tried the antenna at different lengths and attached wires and foil to it to no avail . The AM reception is no prize either ; the box has to be re-oriented just right every time you change the station.Now the CD player is dying . At first cleaning the lens helped a little but not anymore . Either the disc wo n't play at all or only plays the first few tracks , then spins out of control making a chattering noise . This is after very light CD use over the years . When it works it only plays factory CDs ; it does n't take CD-RW or mp3 , and is very touchy about CD-Rs.That leaves the dual cassette players ... .they make a lot of mechanical noise when playing , and dubbing from deck to deck yields poor quality copies . Of course the cassette decks are purely mechanical , meaning they ca n't be remote controlled.This box convinced me Sony 's days as a quality brand are over and is only cruising on its past reputation . The products lately are in the same class as Emerson & other cheapie store brands - preferring visual flash to catch kids ' eyes while disguising junk inside .	-1
this head set works like it says it does , but it is cheply made and no good for motorcycle use .	-1
Plantronics T20 : 90 % PERFECT , 10 % DEADLYThis would be the perfect headset phone if not for a few deadly missteps that led me to return it.Perfect : -- Quality build ( solid ) , the right size , the right features ( buttons for mute , hold , redial , conference , and flash , plus volume and tone controls ) . And the mute has a red indicator so you do n't forget ( although I 'd prefer an indicator that flashed like on the Polycom conference phones ) . -- Also , high quality sound in the headset - I could hear the other party perfectly , with only a faint background hiss.Deadly , starting with the most serious : -- The people I talked with said that I sounded distant . It appears that the microphone does n't come forward far enough to pick up my voice well. -- The headset cord is not shielded and picks up noise from the computer . In particular , I had to be careful to route the cord so that it avoided the keyboard or it picked up a loud tone both parties heard. -- The headset cord is very thin and I worried that a minor mistake ( such as catching it in a closing a desk drawer ) would seriously damage it. -- There is no headset for the T20 that covers both ears ( binaural ) . I called to verify this . Although the headset jack in the base is physically compatible with the binaural headset from my M12 , the headset from the M12 does not work with the T20.It seems like they could make this the perfect phone just by making a few straightforward engineering changes . But until then ... PS - There was always a low hiss in the headset . In looking into noise-canceling technology , I learned that these systems typically introduce a hiss of their own . In a noisy environment , you do n't notice the hiss because the noise the circuitry takes out is much greater than the hiss it adds . But in a quiet environment like mine , there is no benefit to the noise-canceling feature and you hear the hiss . I ca n't guarantee that this was the source of the hiss I heard , but it seems likely . ( There is no way to disable the noise-canceling circuitry . ) I do n't think the Amazon listing mentions the noise-canceling feature of this phone , but it 's on the box .	-1
Bought it . Returned it.Pros : -It reads mp3's-It comes with a reciept.Cons : -Overpriced-Other models have way more options at almost 1/2 the price-skips-doesnt read folders names or songs-bugs galore , turn off it doesnt return to the same song , its sometimes skips 3-4 songs ahead.-sound is poor , and very low . I plugged it into my stereo , had to turn my stereo up full volume just to hear it..and it STILL was low ! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! Buy the Memorex mp3 player , its everything this should of been , but is n't .	-1
This product does not work with Mac OS 1.4.7 and above , though there is no indication of this in the literature . Logitec tells me that it is discontinuing the item , and will not update the software . BE AWARE OF THIS ! ! !	-1
My old review is below and I still think the ergonomics are great with this tracball . HOWEVER in the last 6 months I have gone through 2 controllers . I have 2 wireless tracballs and 2 broken controllers . I am sorry but there is no excuse for electronics without moving parts to be so fragile . Until logitech builds durability into the controllers , STAY CLEAR OF THESE UNITS and get a corded one.Real shame , these are very wrist friendly designs but 2 breaking without any damage is wrong . Fool me once shame on you , twice is on me.Some have complained that the control part of the wireless mouse that plugs into the USB is too big . I velcroed it to the lid of my laptop and also can stick the wireless trackball unit itself to the velcro on the lid also . That taken care of , this is one excellent ergonomic trackball . Having it now wireless is only that much better.Best trackball/mouse for ergonomics but so far not as durable as it should be.I will try a second one and report back on that one as well	-1
Unfortunately , it does not fit OS sized road handlebars ( 31.8 mm bars ) . Basically , its a worthless lump of plastic to me .	-1
For Cx owners , if a different cover were supplied , it would be a good product . The Cx models are designed to hold the microSD card under the cover . The replacement back supplied with this product does not fit the unit . Garmin could have easily molded a back for this mount that would accomodate BOTH the newer and older versions of the Etrex line with a rubber gasket seal . When you purchase a Cx series GPS , there is a supplied add-on mounting clip for the cover that protrudes and catches items when carrying the GPS off the mount .	-1
The case has a plastic window over the GPS display . Unfortunately , it makes the GPS harder to read , especially if the light is not ideal . Also , the window is a little too small , and tends to cover the top of the screen . Since two of the main menus are at the top of the screen , this is a problem . Although I would like the protection provided by the case , I find I ca n't use it .	-1
There 's nothing wrong with this product , it works as advertised , I just do n't like it . The reason why I do n't like it is because it 's not that convenient to access the garmin . I have to either take it out of the protective skin , or pull out the carrying case altogether . Again , this is totally my fault that I do n't like it , there was no false advertising at all , but if I had a chance to purchase it all over again , I would n't .	-1
After reading rave reviews about the capacity , I was confident the bag would accommodate my Rebel xsi body , one short lens and multiple other accessories.Big disappointment.The bag held only the camera body and lens -- just barely . This rendered the bag entirely useless.The bag is very attractive . I can not attest to its ruggedness or reliability , as other reviewers have done.If you have a Rebel xsi , choose the bag made for that camera . It is n't as attractive , but it is a much better choice for that camera and lots of gear .	-1
The bag looks great , and was well made what I did not like is it was just too small for me . If you just have a point and shoot camera this is all you would need but anything else , and it will not be enough space .	-1
When I bought this item I was sure that I had finally solved my quandary of wanting a fully functional PDA combined in one unit with a versatile and easy to read Ebook . Unfortunately the Ebookman misses the mark.The unit fits in the hand very nicely and its rubberized grips make it a joy to handle . The unit is also very light which is usually the bane of electronic Ebook readers such as the Rocket Ebook or Gemstar devices . These are the pluses.The negatives soon became apparent . The downloadable OS is a nice idea but does n't work consistently . The unit is prone to freezing and crashing making it necessary to reload the OS and setting the unit back up . You do n't have to re-enter all your data but you do have to set it up for name and other specifics . Quite a pain . Another issue I have is the battery life . I realize that standard alkaline batteries are cheaper for the manufacturer but if you use this item as both a PDA and regular Ebook device you will need to replace both batteries several times a week . This is a little expensive and inconvenient in my book so I would have liked to see a rechargeable battery with the cradle being the charger.There were several other problems I had with the unit . I thought the device was very slow . I would press for actions and it would delay a half a second . This delay made games useless and data entry annoying . The display is larger than a palm but still is not quite as nice as the larger Hiebook device or Rocket ebook . The display is very difficult to read without the backlight , which exasperates its power issues.The unit does sync well with Outlook and hopefully the future versions of the OS will only improve the unit but for now I returned my unit . I also find it a bit unethical to make MS Reader one of the big selling points on the box and then only in small print read that they have n't figured out how to make it work yet.Overall a device that shows promise but does n't deliver yet .	-1
After owning the EBM 911 for two years , reading several books on it , and really wanting to like it , I finally gave up in total frustration and threw it in the trash . The main problem is the operating system ... which must be downloaded anytime the batteries run low . What you learn very quickly is that the unit drains the batteries even when it is turned off . So when the batteries die , you lose everything that you 've had on the unit : addresses , books , notes , even the operating system . On a dialup connection , it takes 30 minutes or so to get the OS online and then resynchronize everything so that you get your files back and get the darn thing running again . If you were in the middle of reading a book when it went down , it 's very time consuming to find your place again . While it comes with a CD with the OS , if you have gotten a book from a vendor different from Franklin 's distributors , you sometimes run into little problems of compatibility that have to be corrected . I began to add up all the time I 'd spent messing around with this thing and finally decided that it was a massive waste of time and an aggravation nobody needs in their lives . I was surprised to discover that two other friends had given up on this product long before I did . I wonder how many eBookmans have found their final resting place in landfills . Franklin owes consumers an apology for this ill-conceived piece of junk .	-1
I may have read the specs incorrectly , but these are not the more robust zip ties I was hoping to buy . That said , they came on time and were packaged decently . I do wish that there was a strength/pressure rating to help make purchases easier .	-1
I was looking for a bag that would be big enough to carry my Nikon D300 , 18-200 , 70-300 , 28-70 and 17-35 lenses . Not to mention assorted filters , batteries , flash cards , etc . I thought , after doing quite a bit of research , that this bag would suffice . And I suppose it might , if you carefully tucked everything away in the bag and never actually tried to get at anything . Sure , the bag will hold a bunch of 'skinny ' lenses ( problems stuffing in my 17-35 ) , but those lenses are buried under layers of padding velcroed in such a way that makes all but the exposed camera and attached lens readily accessible . For example , the camera and attached lens has to sit on the 'second tier ' of padding in order to use the 'lens gate ' . Under the body , totally hidden , might be another lens . Another problem with the body and lens sitting high up , is that the bag 's center of gravity is higher up and more prone to dump out your gear . And speaking of velcro , trying to rearrange the pads is sort of like herding cats . Another problem are the storage spaces- there simply are n't enough zippered compartments to hold loose items . The front compartment is less of a pouch and more of a sleeve . The side pockets only velcro shut , good luck if it rains . And inside the top lid ? Great for storing pieces of paper , that 's about it . The bag comes down to personal preference . I misfired by choosing this one .	-1
I have tried two of these cards from Amazon , and neither has worked with my Dell 8100 running Windows 2000 . Eventually , not having endless time to resolve the problems , and getting sluggish and frankly useless tech-support from DLink via their website , I gave up and am getting a refund.Do n't waste your time on this worthless piece of junk .	-1
I 've done everything I can think of short of paying the long distance charge to call tech support to get this card to work . I 've decided to sell the card to a friend and get another one that will work with WinMe .	-1
I am using this for an outdoor speaker setup including 4 sets of speakers on 3 separate outputs . The unit is a nice size and seems to be good build quality . The connectors are solid and I had no issues . My only complaint is that when I only have my zone 2 speakers selected there is still some output to the zone 3 speakers . Its very low volume but noticable.Since this is an outdoor setup its not a big deal for me but keep this in mind depending on your application.Update : After a year or so the unit now seems to play full sound over all three speaker pairs . I have to lower my rating for this .	-1
This is a word of advice to any would-be buyers of the jamcam 3.0 : & quot ; Do n't ! & quot ; . The product is a toy at best . But the real problem ( yes , there is one worse ) is the business practices of this company . Non-existent customer support ( emails bounce ) , invalid toll-free numbers , and unclaimable rebate offers . There is defintiely something fishy going on . I would go as far as to say beware of KBgear in general . I learned at a price . I rate this product a one-star only b/c a zero rating is not possible .	-1
I bought these bacause of the good reviews ; I was amazed upon getting an iPod that the 'phones included with it have so little volume and so little bass . ( I am especially annoyed with that , the whole 'no bass ' thing ; I love rock and roll and I love it loud and punchy as I ride that mountain bike ) . Anyways , I got these and found that they fit well in my ear , looked forward to comparing with the other phones I purchased at the same time , to test them out against the inexpensive Philips phones , the best I 'd found thus far.A horrific comparison . These phones are trash . No volume to speak of . Junky midrange , junky treble , muddy , soft bass , no bass , really ; it 's like listening to music under water , maybe if you have a radio on when you take a bath and then dunk your head under the water - that 's how these headphones sound.I 'm sending them back for refund but even if they did n't refund the dough I 'd not keep them , I 'd gladly cut them up with a smile on my lips , a song in my heart.Buy the Philips HS500 Behind-the-Head Headphones instead . They absolutely rock , great throughout the entire range , loud as can be ( though I 'd have them louder if I could - LOUD is best on that mountain bike ) , clear , thumping bass , great highs , great midrange , all clear . And nine bucks , to boot . I have tried at least twenty pair of phones , the Philips HS500 stand alone , the best .	-1
Not sure if it is genuine or not , but this cable does not work properly . The sound cuts out of the left channel and you have to wiggle the cable to make it work . This is not a good product .	-1
I use this for my iPod in my car . After 4 months of near daily use , it is cutting out the right channel very consistently ; I have to jiggle it to get it working correctly . Total pain when you 're driving . Although , it started cutting out about two months ago , I 've just been putting up with it since then . I will be ordering a more expensive one ( $ 8Mediabridge - 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable - ( 4 Feet ) [ New design accomodates iphone , itouch , smartphone and mp3 cases ] ) in hopes it will last longer .	-1
1 . I have a iPhone3Gs with a case , the cable wo n't get on without removing the case ! 2 . I did manage to use the product for about 10 days ( hence the extra star ) , as I was compelled to do so . I was on a 4000 mile road trip . Shielding is not that good , but good for the price I guess . But somehow the sound quality deteriorated after around 8 days of use . When I moved the cable a little bit , it would go back to normal.I later returned the product as I had already bought a aux cable from radioshack , which I have to say , works flawlessly , I do n't even need to remove the case . Its not too over priced , I think I bought it for $ 7 . I definitely would recommend this over the Belkin . That said , I am a big fan of Belkin products , if it were not for the first issue I would have definitely reordered a replacement !	-1
On my first use , the connector from the wire to the wrist band broke . Its not worth the cost or shiping . I have not been a fan of belkin , and i will never buy another product of theirs again , period . Over priced equiptment with horid quality .	-1
I got the product and tried to hook it up to my pc case to ground my self as i was reaching over the clip broke from the yellow strap . I guess you get what you paid for , good thing is its cheap bad thing is what a waste of money .	-1
Thought it was to remove scratches and stuff but so much for that Ideal . . maybe for tiny scratches It may work !	-1
I purchased this product since it was a `` recommendation '' , along with a case , when I purchased my Fujitsu scanner . This cable does n't even fit the scanner ! I 'm sure it 's a good cable and should be rated higher than 1 star - so take that into consideration . Do Not buy this product as part of a `` bundle '' from Amazon because it 's totally useless and is n't needed for the Fujitsu scanner . I expect better - and normally receive better - from Amazon .	-1
I got this cable because it was a bit more appropriately priced and because of expected Belkin quality . I fail to understand why these cables are so expensive in US ... it just does'nt make sense ! ! I have been buying network/ethernet cables all my life at one-tenth the cost in other countries and hardly ever had issues with them . There is hardly any difference in quality of these products to make them worth anything beyond US $ 5 for a 15ft cable . Anyways seeing the somewhat better price on this product and perfect ratings I ordered this from Amazon . The cable arrived promptly a few days ago and I only got to test the cable out yesterday . To my disappointment the cable did n't work . I am also doubtful if it is a genuine Belkin product because of the cheap feel of the package it came in . Anyways I never expected this even of a fake knock-off product since its very easy to test these cables before packaging or sending them out . Have requested a refund and will probably not order these cables from Amazon again .	-1
I remembered after getting this cable , why I returned 2 years ago . I update my cables every few years , once I switched to this my network basically came to a halt	-1
This set was barely enough to remove the back of my MacBook laptop . I could not replace the battery and had to order another set to get the needed screwdrivers .	-1
Makes typing awkward and the cover looks weird on the keyboard . I guess if I were in an environment rife with nasty stuff potentially spilling on my keyboard , I 'd like this better , since it would probably protect . I was just looking for something to cover the keys and protect the cheapo letter replacement stickers from wearing off again ... this is n't right for that use .	-1
Instructions for installing this card were a nightmare to follow . I bought this card to help my mom out and even I could not understand the instructions which were poorly translated from Chinese . The proper driver was not included on the disk and it was extremely difficult to find a Windows 7 driver . Netgear does not seem to fully support this hardware with windows drivers . I would have sent it back , but the price was so cheap , it just was not worth the hassle . I did learn to never buy a cheap NIC card like this in the future .	-1
Buying this hub could be the worst thing you ever do to your computer . I run Windows XP , and it warned me that this hub is not Windows XP certified . Fine by me , since most hardware is n't , but works just fine.Everything was going fine until I tried plugging in USB peripherals . None of them worked , including my Logitech Quickcam , Epson C80 printer , and Handspring Visor cradle.Later that night , it was driver conflict hell . Before long , I lost my entire Windows XP install due to repeated appearances of the Blue Screen of Death ( yep , it does exist in Windows XP after all ) .Needless to say , I will never buy another Belkin product again , if I can help it .	-1
I 've had this hub for a while and it worked fine ( even though the AC adapter was a little bit clunky ) . But recently I tried attaching an 802.11b receiver via the USB and the thing would n't work after 3 days of use - Windows reported it being an Unknown Device . Plugging into the back of my computer would still report the same problem - I figured the wireless adapter was faulty . But then ... The other day I plugged a trusty Sidewinder into the hub to play some old games . Tonight the same thing happened - Windows now refuses to recognize the gamepad I 've used faithfully for years now . I am convinced this hub is the culprit . Spend a little more money to buy a hub whose quality you can really depend on ! Perhaps this was purely my own experience with a faulty hub , but I 'd strongly recommend you consider another product - you may be putting your expensive electronics at unnecessary risk .	-1
Let 's face it , these are n't high quality automotive parts , there not meant for stress . After a few years of sparingly using this toolkit . The driver magnet fell out , so bits do n't stay in place . The bits are damaged and chipped.There are better sets out there , the wirestripper is a JOKE . Your better off buying a good quality brand name set , snapon , craftsmen , even duralast .	-1
I 'd recommend selecting a different security cable product , especially if you have a PowerBook or MacBook . This one is poorly made , even more poorly documented , and may have permanently damaged my PowerBook G4 . ( Yes , the product web site claims this model is compatible with the PB G4 . ) It 's unclear from the cryptic instruction diagram on the back of the packaging which direction is locked and which is unlocked . ( Hey , would it be so bad to actually use *words* to explain things ? Even in 4 or 5 languages if you like . The diagrams make no sense . ) In the process of trying to get this to work , it appears that the locking teeth chewed up the security slot of my PowerBook . It may have permanently damaged the slot . Needless to say , I will attempt to return the product for a refund.There are plenty of similar products on the market , including others avaiable through Amazon . I 'd suggest trying one of those .	-1
I 'm not exactly sure how the manufacture expects you to use this product on an airplane , as the stabilizing bar behind your head prevents you from leaning back into your seat.I bought this and the Aiwa noise cancelling headphones at the same time . The Koss headphones are going up on eBay .	-1
Amazon is always greatHowever ; these are cheap plastic tools made in china . Something you would purchase from Harbor Freight . Amazon 's return policy is always outstanding . Sorry Belkin	-1
On my third battery in 4 years . Not sure if the UPS is no good or the batteries are . According to the mfg these should last 3-5 years ... no where even close . The battery is a good fit and does work just not for long . Am shopping for another brand of UPS .	-1
We ordered 2 of these APC batteries . We received 1 APC , and another one from a company called `` ABC '' that looks like a cheap knock-off.I could n't believe Amazon was shipping a knockoff after we purchased the original . So I requested a replacement . They apologized and sent one out.We received it , and guess what , it 's another ABC battery ! I complained again , and this time the guy admits if he orders another replacement , it 'll probably happen again , so he 's just going to give us a refund ! WTF , why does n't someone at Amazon ask themselves why they are shipping knock-off products as real products ? If I was APC , I would be pissed .	-1
I can not believe how stiff these keys are . I thought that this was not going to be a big deal , but it was a deal-killer for me . On the plus side , it is angled nicely with a comfortable hand pad . Unfortunately , the hand pad takes up a lot of real estate and can not be removed .	-1
This might perhaps be a good product , but it will only work with a headset that has a quick-release plug . I have not found such a headset -- even the headset I have from Plantronics has the normal 2.5mm plug ( and that one is loud enough so that it does n't need any amplification ) . I 've tried adding on an adapter , but adding extra adapters and connectors can ruin the sound quality or make sound output too weak for anyone to hear.This amplifier plugs into the phone 's handset jack instead of into a 2.5mm/3.5mm headset jack -- this means you have to pick up the receiver and set it down somewhere whenever you want to make or answer a call , instead of just pressing a button to use the phone 's headset feature .	-1
1 year and 7 months after installing these batteries , my APC Smart-UPS 1000 UPS is telling me to replace the batteries . Ridiculous !	-1
I 've owned MANY lens filters throughout decades of shooting.This filter causes Odd Muddy-Mutated Tones..Very weird looking.You Get what you pay for . I recommend , do n't waste your money .	-1
The Panasonic Lumix FZ35 has a really nice Leica super-zoom lens that opens to very wide angle - great feature , very useful . When this filter is mounted on the lens ( it screws onto the end ) the four corners of the frame show the edges of the filter . All four corners are black . Once you zoom in a bit this goes away , but it 's annoying . I do n't know if this is a problem with the filter or the lens but I 'm disappointed .	-1
I needed a CP in a hurry and was on a tight budget for some photography I was going to do out in the desert . Although it DOES have a high degree of polarization , when you are doing landscapes with large areas of sky there is VERY pronounced color banding . Depending on how you have it set , it is very easy to end up with a dark stripe right in the middle of the sky with lighter bands on both sides . I 've not seen this issue with the more expensive CPs .	-1
This is the first Tiffen filter I have purchased in decades and it is a huge disappointment . I remember the older ones having more threads on each side . This filter ( 58MM Circular Polarizer ) is so minimalist it barely has enough threads to fasten to my camera . Trying to rotate the filter is a trick . There is nothing to hold onto and if I am not careful the polarizer can come off the camera .	-1
Honestly , it does not do anything . Literally , nothing at all . Aside from lower picture quality . It is very cheap , so really cant be upset . If you want a Circular polarizer , get something nicer .	-1
I seated this on my Nikon 70-200 2.8 VRII lens , The thread depth is very narrow and difficult to seat on the lens . Unfortunately I have discovered that putting it on the lens was the least of my isues . Getting it off is a whole new challenge in its own right . Might as well order the filter removal tool when you buy this filter . I will say functionally it did a nice job on my photos , but getting this filter off my lens has jaded me on this product .	-1
I 'm confused by these reviews . Amazon , what 's going on ? Am I wrong or does Amazon have to pay more attention to these reviews ? I googled `` close-up attachments '' and went into amazon . No , I did not want a warming filter , polarizer and UV wrapped into a 3 filter package deal . I wanted information on the close-up attachments that usually come numbered 1 , 2 and 3 , indicating each filters relative close-up focusing capabilities.These reviews are a mixture of the above.Pay attention Amazon . And stop profiling my interests and saturating me with offers on items that you are certain I will like ... ..all the while trying to make the automation look personal . Do you people really believe that we consumers are that stupid ? If all that selling is what pays for amazon ... ... ... .you can have it folks .	-1
The most important part of a camera is the lens . And in the lens is glass , and the optics of that glass will in many way set the price and the quality of the lens . That is why proline models , like the Canon L series costs more than the standard models and if you compare them you will see a difference . One thing to keep in mind , is that if you damage the image coming in to the lens , the lens and camera ca n't repair it . The quality of the filter you put in front of your lens will affect the quality of the image you get . Most filters , even some of the top Hoya are just plain window glass , granted some are coated but the optics of the glass are still low quality ! This will affect your image . If you are using a simple basic lens like a Sigma or Tokina then a lower optics quality filter like this wont make much of a difference . However , if you are using a higher grade lens , you need a higher grade filter . The only 2 ground glass filters that I have found are the B+W and Heliopan . They are more expensive , but well worth it ! You get what you pay for ! A UV filter serves a 2 fold purpose.1st it helps to protect your lens and keep it from getting scratches or damaged ! I have seen a camera dropped and the uv filter shattered but the lens was still working and so was the camera . What would have happened w/o the filter , I dont know , but I would guess it would not have turned out so good . I am often out in the outdoors , and the UV filters I use , B+W mostly , have protected my lenses from several scraps and scratches that could have cost thousands to repair or replace ! 2nd the UV filter does filter out some UV light , and thus you will see less haze in some of your shots . Not a Good Circ . Polarizer can also help in this matter as well ! Note if you have a very wide angle lens , like a 10-18MM you should get a slim model UV filter or else you can see black corners in your picts when you are at max wide angle.Hope this helps .	-1
I got this Tiffen filter to protect my new Panasonic FZ28 's lens , and it has just proven that it cost $ 10.81 more than it is worth . I was testing the camera outside during the evening and , as I focused on the city lights , I suddenly noticed that the lights were bouncing off the filter and reflecting into the camera . I took a couple of test shots with the filter , removed it and took another couple of test shots . When I downloaded the images into my computer , there they were : horrible `` ghost '' lights scattered in the dark sky over the real city lights , and only in the photos taken with the filter in place . I know there is a technical term for them -- glare or flare or something else ? -- and I also know that they should n't be there . This obviously means that the Tiffen 46mm Haze-1 is worthless . I want something that will protect my lens but that wo n't spoil my photos.My FZ18 ( which is my mom 's now ) has a Quantaray multi-coated UV filter that never interfered in my photos in any way . I looked for that filter on the web but unfortunately could n't find it . By the reviews here I thought I 'd be okay with the Tiffen . I was wrong , and must now look for a new filter .	-1
It 's not the most clear glass , but it works . However , I bought it for the protection on my Canon 17-40mm lens . It always sounded a little loose and moved easily ... then finally it CRACKED . I 'm lucky it did n't scratch my new lens . I 'm going for the B & W filters from now on . So much for savings , now I 'm paying more than I would have if I just did it right the first time !	-1
This is cheap gear . The only things I can say it does as expected are 1 ) it fits , and 2 ) it will protect your lens 's front element ... mostly.The glass fits the ring poorly and shifts , letting dust get to your lens , thus requiring you to clean your lens 's front element , which presents the opportunity to damage it that you were trying to avoid by installing this `` protective '' filter.The optics are questionable , as other point out.If you 're broke , and just want to keep fingers off your lens , sure . Otherwise , get anything better , like a Hoya , or splurge and get a B+W .	-1
The 58mm UV filter would not fit any of three 58mm Canon lenses in my bag . The threads are just poorly cut . In the mailbox for return already .	-1
Product review : You get what you pay for.Customer Support : Very unprofessional.If you go directly to their website , you will find out the true colors of their employees.I do n't know why there are still lazy employees exist on this world !	-1
glass lense filter rattles in the housing ? ? ? ? I am filling in with this comment to fulfill the word requirement ! dumb requirement .	-1
This filter flares excessively and is unworthy of any optical system . All inventory should be recycled immediately . Once again you do n't get what you do n't pay for . The clear Nikon filter that I replaced this with functions very well .	-1
I got this filter before I understood the difference between cheap filters and ones that actually work well . I was getting such great results with my new 50mm f/1.8 lens during the day , but at night i was getting a lot of ghosting and flaring in my pictures . It took me a while to realize it was because of the filter . After doing some online research , I decided to remove the filter , and my pictures were all suddenly better with that lens . The glass was affecting my picture quality ! The glass used is cheap , and not very good quality , so it can actually degrade your pictures . It works well to protect the glass on the lens from scratches or dust , but it 's a much better idea to pay $ 20 more and get a good filter that will actually help you get better pictures . If you do n't want to pay the extra for a decent filter , you might be better off just leaving the filter off . I reccomend Hoya Pro1 and B & W ; filters ; and in the 52mm size , the price is very reasonable . Once you start buying nicer lenses that require 77mm filters , that 's where the good filters really start adding up . But again , you are n't going to want to put a cheap filter on a $ 1000 lens.I know this review might sound negative , but if it helps someone capture a memory better because they decided to get a little nicer filter , it will be worth it .	-1
ok it could happen i got the one bad filter on the rack , but unlikely . my gear lens wise was given to me by my sister really sweet stuff awesome quality , either she unloaded tons of cash on the lenses or the quality has dropped like crazy over the years.this really just a sup par product , it gets stuck on the lens hard to get off , then the build quality is just terrible.the glass seems pretty cheap , but im probably gon na have to keep it cuz it 'll probably cost more than 5 bucks to ship it back , we 'll see what they say at the post office .	-1
I 've read a ton on filters for protection of my lenses ... Do n't buy Tiffen , do n't even buy Hoya ... spend the money on B+W clear protector filters . They really do n't mess up your images . The Tiffen filters pickup everything and add nasty ghosting to your images .	-1
I bought this Tiffen 77mm UV Filter for my Canon 100-400mm IS lens . Since I got the lens I have not been getting the quality of shots I expected . Long story short , the problem was this filter . I took it off and instantly had the lens of my dreams . If you care about image quality you may want to reconsider .	-1
Again , the headline says it all . I bought this for my VIXIA HF S200 . Does not fit . Kinda bummed , ya know ?	-1
barely works as a lens protector . Do n't waste your moneyThese are NOT multi coated , I doubt they 're even single coated . I see they 're no longer advertised as multi-coated . They were when I bought them . These are plain glass , they reflect every thing a sheet of glass will.Why someone is trying to sell a warming filter in this day and age should indicate that these are old technology , aimed at film cameras . Digital cameras can correct for light sources , so this filter is for the bin . The polarizer does polarize ... ... . a bit . but not much . It does n't handle reflections well at all . The `` UV '' is plain glass - it really is a joke.The pouch is a ridiculous idea . who can keep filters clean in a pouch ? Mine were clearly used also . with scratches in the threads indicating they 'd be installed several times before . the glass was also very dirty , and was clearly handled by several people . I 'm not taking stars off for the seller incompetence , but the condition I received these in was unacceptable.A poor product , clearly returned by several others . look else where .	-1
I had a home network with my dial up internet access and when I switched to Comcast @ Home was told to go out and buy a router with a firewall . I bought the D-Link 704 in large part because I was under the impression that it integrated seamlessly with my cable service . Setting up the port and attaching it to the PCs was a snap as was getting the network to work . In about 30 minutes , I was up and running . However , the firewall built into the hardware required constant tweaking to get things like mIRC and other software programs that my son uses to work . The package comes with a quick start guide and manual but they were virtually indecipherable to me , an admitted non-techie . After a few days of trying to tweak the firewall , getting a completely unhelpful response from the tech department of D-Link and emailing with some other users who had the same problems ( based on usenet posts ) , I gave up and put everything back in the box . I ended up buying a simple port and using Live Alarm Pro as my firewall . Works like a charm . I will be selling my D-Link 704 on Amazon in a few moments if anyone wants a used one that is virtually brand new !	-1
Amazon incorrectly states the following in its writeup under features : Compatible with Canon EOS 10D , D60 , D30 , Pro90 IS , G1 , G2 , G3 and G5 modelsThis does NOT work with the G3 model . The battery has a groove at the bottom which makes it impossible to fit in the G3 battery compartment . So , if you need a lithium battery for your G3 , look elsewhere on Amazon . I noticed in the writeup from the manufacturer , below the Amazon description , it does NOT list the G3 as being compatible . I wish I had heeded that instead of Amazon 's description , which is usually very accurate.BTW I love the Canon G3 and Amazon too .	-1
i do n't know what to say about this item . when i place my order i was expecting something that work but when i got it , sorry to say this but the item is dead ... . ( no work )	-1
It only works in low light because the suns ' rays interfere with the infra-red sensor . You have to be in front of the camera and at close range.I bought this wireless-remote control and it is SOOOO much better for wildlife , micro , sunsets and fireworks or anything you want to shoot , but ca n't be touching the camera : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KDXQLA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1	-1
I do not recommend this product . The flap does not stay down as good as Memorex brand . I would rather spend more money on the better sleeves .	-1
The connector does not fit my Printer . The pin numbers are correct but physical size is larger than my connection .	-1
Wrapping on handle peeled off after short time of use . Not sure if manufacturing defect or if item was used or damaged .	-1
Used as a replacement ( ca n't find the original ) . Much longer than the standard plugs . Works.UPDATE : This cord fried the motherboard on the PC . Had to have it rebuilt . The power supply was actually melted !	-1
I have bought Cables to Go cables for years - excellent quality at an excellent price . I purchased three cables ( supposedly Cables to Go ) from Marginmart fullfilled by Amazon ; a 2m white USB A-B , a 3m white USB A-B , and a USB mini cable.The 2m cable is great , no complaints ( it might even be the real thing ) . I knew I had a problem as soon as I opened the 3m cable - not white , but grey . The two cables were supposedly identical , except for the length , but they look totally different , even different connectors on the ends . The wire on the 3m cable is about 1/2 the thickness of the 2m cable ( same product , longer cable = smaller cable ? I do n't think so ) . I tried hooking it up to my printer and immediately started getting printer errors.I then tried the USB mini which I bought for a backup HD . As soon as I plugged it in the HD started making beeping noises I have never heard before , then refused to mount . Hmmm ... Based on past experience with Cables to Go , the junk I received is NOT their product , but a super cheap knock-off . Beware this vendor - this is not legitimate stuff .	-1
Maybe it would work better with a different writer . Audio had a buzzing and the voices are in a 'fog ' . Maybe it will work with some other gadget . At least I did n't spend a ton .	-1
I just bought a Spanish Program to enhance my Spanish skills , so I needed a microphone to help me out with the program.Microphone is light , weak and does n't do too much for me . I would prefer a more heavy duty mic for anything.Secondly , it does n't work at all . I understand it is typically used for online chat and what have you but my comp does n't even recognize it or hear anything when I speak to it.Obviously I 'm not too upset because I paid a measily [ ... ] bucks for it , but stay away from this mic anyway . It 's not woth the [ ... ] bucks.Overall quality is very poor as well .	-1
Would not fit , it was the right card but the space between the pin connector and the mount was too large . I was afraid it would break something if I forced it in .	-1
This device did n't work at all . Also the driver disc does n't identify which drivers are for which devices . ( IE : The phrase ST100S is not mentioned on any drivers , and there are a lot ) .Went to their website and downloaded the drivers . The folder for XP was empty . ( Even though XP is supposed to auto install this , nothing I tried worked ) . Refund was instant and I did n't have to return defective product !	-1
Most slot fans are n't `` worth a bucket of warm pi** '' This one is . I ungraded my video card to a GeForce GTX470 . That sucker puts out some serious heat and my HP Pavillion case had no room for another case fan . Enter the Antec slot fan . Its quiet ( quiet enough ) and does cool down my system.11/2011 Update : Downgraded by review . Fan grew increasingly noisy and died recently . Had to yank it out and put in a new one , same brand . Guess what ? Started making noise after two weeks . Returned it and wo n't try another .	-1
I bought this product in December 2007 and it was working great , I used it for my video card , but after six months of use , it started to make a big noise due to dust accumulation , and the rpms reduced notably . It stopped working after seven months of use . I have a vantec PCI fan in other PC , and have been working for over two years and no problems.Tried to clean this fan , but it come in a sealed case , so it is not possible . Really did not like this product . Really short lifetime .	-1
The cable did not work with my legacy HP LaserJet 6L in a Windows 7 new installation . Had to return it .	-1
Unit died . Receptacles for appliance plugs are all dead . Light shows line OK , fault protection light is not on , on-off switch is lit.Ca n't even use as an extender because plugs are all dead.Protected against surge but then was worthless .	-1
These headphones are AWFUL . Yes , the construction is excellent and they are quite comfortable considering they 're girth , but the bass is NON-EXISTENT . I tried them out right out of the box with my iPod , first with some Public Enemy and then some Guns n ' Roses . They failed both tests epically . I did n't even bother to run them through some classical or jazz , since , even at high volume ( both on the headphones themselves and my iPod/laptop ) there was an abysmal response . Do n't waste your time . I 'm returning them right after submitting this review .	-1
Excellent noise reduction.tight fit , get loose with time ( or on a book overnight ) less than mediocre sound quality . no lows at all , lacks volume .	-1
I got this watch for Christmas and so wanted to like it . Ultimately I returned it because of the following issues:1 . Watch is a lot bulkier than it looks from the photos . This is a big bulky watch.2 . Dark background and contrasting numbers is far from & # 34 ; easy to read & # 34 ; as stated in the description . Almost impossible to read in dimly lit environments . No way to increase the contrast . This was my biggest issue.3 . Backlight is very dim . You can not even tell it is working except in pitch black environments . Even then you have to squint to read the dial.4 . Many complicated button functions . Be prepared to spend a whole day with the manual ( which does not come with the watch ) to figure out the multiple combinations that you will never remember . It might have helped to label the buttons . As is , the labels are invisible as they are molded into the plastic and so small you need a magnifying glass and good light to even read them . A contrasting color might have helped .	-1
I bought this router about a year ago . It looks nice and sets up easily and would be a strong recommend -- if it would continue working properly.After only a few months , I started noticing the occasional internet access outage . Never even really thought about it . Then it grew progressively worse , up to 15 or 20 times a day . Not being a network guru , it 's taken quite a bit of time and effort to trace the problem back to the router . Linksys tech support did n't even answer my emails ( and phone support is now a 900 number ) .Do n't buy this product unless you hate yourself and enjoy having your internet access fail whenever you seem to need it most .	-1
I have one of these which worked very well for six months . At that point however , it failed . Be aware that if this happens to you , you will be at the mercy of Linksys 's antiquated RMA process . After spending 1/2 an hour on the phone , doing several hard resets , the very nice woman informed me that my modem had & quot ; gone bad & quot ; and that the process of getting an RMA number sent to me via email would take 2-3 days . She then informed me that I should fill out the emailed RMA form and return it with the defective device . She said I should expect to receive a new device 7-10 business days later.I cringe at telling my spouse and kids that cable modem access will be out for the remainder of the month.All told , they appear to have a well designed product that was fairly easy to get running . But I find their response to a clear product failure six month 's after purchase to be woefully inadequate . My recommendation would be to find another product .	-1
I got this router two years ago and used it to share my DSL connection among my computers . Setting it up was very easy . I did get disconnected once or twice a week , but I never investigated if it was the router or my DSL provider who dropped the connection . Now it 's been two years and the dreaded Diag light went solid red the other day . I contacted Linksys tech support through on-line chat from their web site and got a quick response . Unfortunatly they told me the router is broken and there is nothing they can do . Easy installation , low price , good tech support , but possibly dropped connections and limited lifespan -- that comes out at two stars in my book .	-1
I bought mine at a local Micro Center . I wish I 'd looked here first . The Linksys was easy to set up and would probably work fine for 99 percent of people . I also like the fact that this is not an 802.11b base station . I prefer to have the security option of unplugging the wireless base station and therefore it needs to be a separate physical box.What about those 1 percent of users who wo n't like this product ? If you like to keep TCP connections open for a long time , e.g. , if you 're a developer using ssh or telnet , this Linksys is problematic . My old SMC router , after upgrading the firmware , was rock solid and I could keep an Emacs up and running on a remote server for days or weeks . With the Linksys connections will mysteriously die . I have n't changed my cable modem or my cable service .	-1
Do NOT buy this router . It continually looses it 's connection to the internet . If you take the time to peruse the chat rooms at Linksys you will find that this is a know issue with this unit and there is no solution .	-1
I installed two of these cards on my Mom and Dad 's laptops . One , a Compaq Presario running Windows ME , became completely hosed after the install software destroyed the registry . I 'm going to have to reinstall the whole machine.The other , a Dell Latitude running Windows 2000 Pro , goes into an endless reboot loop if the card is plugged in . Both the HW and SW are junk in my opinion .	-1
Do not buy this camera ! The batteries die in less that one set of 36 pictures . The quality is poor even on the highest setting . Do n't compare megapixels , there is a difference in image quality between cameras of the same resolution . The flash takes almost a minute to charge sometimes . And it shuts off after taking a picture . mine is a combination of defects and poor design . It 's going back . I made the mistake of thinking I could get a digital camera for $ 200 . You have to spend $ 500 to get a decent one which is just too much for the mass market right now .	-1
Buying these are like buying a cheap bike . They 'll probably stay in your drawer and quash any interest you have in either viewing celestial or terrestrial ( or in some cases , telestial ) objects . In short , these binocs will probably last at least a lifetime because they 're so poor in rendering a respectable image . Seriously , buy a NIKON . You wo n't regret it . Also , if the people who gave these binocs a good review knew what they were buying , they would n't be buying entry level Bushnell binocs.There are so many things going on when binoculars are focusing an image , things like chromatic aberration . Colors focus at slightly different points and a good lens has to bring them all together into one crisp image . The best way to see what I 'm talking about is by picking up a pair of these binocs and then comparing them directly with a decent pair . Now please realize , even NIKON is n't considered GREAT , just decent . To get GREAT optics , plan on spending six or seven hundred clams , and more than a grand for super-photo quality optics . But , as with bicycles and everything else , there is usually a point of diminishing marginal return somewhere along the way . The basic rule of thumb is to NOT TO BUY CHEAP . If your binocs have Busruby-coated lenses , run , do n't walk away from them ! ( These Bushnells are n't that bad , but your eyes deserve crisp , contrasty images , and with these binocs , you 'll find yourself first focusing and then refocusing , vainly trying to find that sweet spot of clarity that never comes . ) So what are you doing still reading this ? Point your mouse to a NIKON or try to find a pair of these used . You should be able to find them cheap .	-1
These binoculars are n't the quality that Bushnell claims.I ca n't get them to focus clearly.Not very happy with this purchase	-1
One reason to buy circumnaural ( around the ear ) headphones is to reduce environmental sound.These headphones block nothing at all ... .nothing . I can hear the environment just as easily as if they were not on.Otherwise , adequate for the price ... nothing special .	-1
I have had lots of problems with this card , and I have still not gotten it to work . I have an IBM Thinkpad , a Sony Vaio , and a Powerbook G4 . This card doesnt work in *any* of them . I have followed the instructions very carefully.An important note here : The Windows 95 instructions are downright *wrong* and make no allowances for differences in system configuration ( for example insisting that the CD-ROM be D : , as opposed to E : ) . There is _no_ installer on the CD , and Windows was n't able to find any drivers on the disk.Linux is another story . The card does not seem to power up correctly , so the Linux kernel module cant seem to talk to it . This is probably due to the poor fit of the card in all three of my laptops . I 'll get into that in a moment.In MacOS , the card powered up ( the Powerbook has a very slick PCMCIA dock , so that doesnt surprise me at all ) . However , there are a ) no drivers and b ) it doesnt even attempt to identify itself as 99 % of the other PCMCIA cards out there do.In general , this card has been bad news , and I 'm not sure what to make of it , other than chalking it up to $ 100 down the drain.A further issue , which really prevents me from ever wanting to buy Linksys hardware in the future , is that the card just doesnt & quot ; fit & quot ; right into the VAIO or the Thinkpad ( both very mainstream , expensive laptops ) . It is necessary to push the card in so hard it feels like the antenna may break off . This is a horrible way to manufacture a product.Lastly , and mostly least , is the fact that the card comes with no case whatsoever . Because it has this huge antenna sticking out the side , it could be easily broken by leaving it in the laptop when moving the laptop around ( which you do with every other card , right ? ) . Your only choice is to continue to use the static baggie that comes with it or improvise something.Overall , the implementation and conception of this product is poor at best , and I will never buy another Linksys product again . Its a miss in three different operating systems on three different laptops .	-1
A new version of the card is on the shelves now ( version 2.5 ) that has more problems than any previous version I have played with . I am a network engineer and I have had previous experience with 802.11b gear in the past.The documentation that comes with this card is incomplete . I can not get the device to send data to either of my BEFW11S4 routers , although it shows that the link is valid . No setting change would make this better.Forget about linux support for the v2.5 card . I ca n't get windows to work with the card , and linux seems to have a problem with the CIS . Maybe it will change sometime , but what I get from the linux wireless development groups is that no plans are in place to make this card work . The previous versions do work.I have had this card for over a month , and have yet to get a live body on the phone , or a response from linksys via email , regardless of the number of requests I have made for simple answers to questions such as : & quot ; What configuration must my LINKSYS befw11s4 and WPC11 card have for the two to communicate ? & quot ; amoungst others.My suggestion : Do n't buy anything linksys . If you do , pray that it works as intended , and out of the box . It does n't matter if you do it for a living , or if you have experience with the type of gear you are buying . Go with another vendor .	-1
I like my Linksys equipment . But in my cinder block Hawaiian house , the wireless hub is on one end , and not more than 40 feet away , I ca n't reach the dining room table or the kitchen , where I prefer to watch movies stored on my Linux machine.I even got past the problems with the XP install and it works like a charm sitting right by the hub.This card needs some more boost ... ..	-1
I bought this card together with a LinkSys wireless access point to replace an older D-Link combination . Tried to install it on my laptop under Windows XP . The bottom line ? After 16 hours of trying , multiple visits to the LinkSys website , multiple converasations with their tech support , installing new drivers , installing new firmware , attempting to reinstall it more than 10 times , I gave up . Reinstalled my old stuff and sent this thing back . The most aggravating part was tech support . All I got was & quot ; you need new drivers & quot ; even though the stuff was BRAND NEW . The install procedure in the manual is wrong ( according to tech support ) . How can they sell stuff like this ?	-1
These were the headphones I longed for for more than 10 years . I felt connected to Koss so I was `` electro '' estatic when it arrived . But this soon turned into agony when I found out the front part of the amp had scratches all over on the front face and two careless razor nicks where the amp had cut outs for switches etc . ( Note I ordered these phones direct from the factory after what I suspect were used ones I had been receiving elsewhere despite being advertised as `` new '' ) . These were brand new and the leather bag had a pleasant leather smell that permeated for days in my room and the black box it came in was not creased all over like others I had received . The previous ESP ( s ) were not like this.Calling Koss was a great shock . The customer service lady kept referring to the scratches sarcastically as smudges and basically refuted what I was saying , even though I had the evidence right in my hand ! I could not wipe it off with anything , including with mild solution . I thought being their most expensive audiophile product I would get better service from Koss , but no , you are treated like you are trying to rip them off ! The scratches could easily be seen when light was angled on it . I decided to return it to their famous lifetime warranty service and hoped they would just give me another brand new one . In fact , I offered them to just send me a faceplate and I would replace it myself , as the ESP seemed to be brand new I did n't want to let go of it based on my previous experiences , but they said no . I began to have a bad feeling about this and reluctantly packed it up and sent it back.I sent the entire unit back per their instructions and received an amp that had no scratches on it back but minus the factory plastic protective bag and the manual that was sent with it ! ! ! The worst part was the right earpad ( I can not tell if it was the original or not ) began to make a static sound ! I decided at paying so much for the ESP that this should not happen and the cost of returning and sending them back was getting too prohibitive . It cost me a total of $ 80 bucks , and to take another chance at their `` crack '' lifetime warranty repair staff was something I was not going to do twice . Maybe this time they will make it perfect and the left earpad will start making a static sound to match the right and there goes another $ 40 plus a another lifetime warranty repair fee added ! Well they say the 3rd time is the charm . Probably the Koss repair department has that engraved on their front wall.To my surprise I received my refund minus the free shipping cost they offered ! I complained to Koss to refund my entire cost as the ESP was defective on their part and their famed lifetime warranty service made it worse , from defective to unusable . They refunded my total cost only after I threatened them to take it up the `` chain '' .Quality control or reliability is another issue as I found out some supposedly new ESP phones sound different from each other ( especially in the bass area ) or have cosmetic flaws , gold rusting on the logos or the earpads are mismatched in the cushioning areas . The inside of the amp seemed ill connected to the circuit board with connectors and the small bulb light not really lining up correctly , but it still was somewhat solid . Surprisingly the volume/balance knob worked fine and seemed accurate and firm . I am only complaining because at this price could n't they take the time to make sure at least it looked correct ? Conclusion : after thinking about this for awhile I decided these headphones may be too fragile and not worth my cost to own again and may weigh heavily against a future decision . I might have changed my mind had they just replaced it with new one pulled from the rack or maybe if the lifetime warranty service had done a careful `` audiophile '' job on it . ( I am particular at this price range ) . It 's also apparent to me that maybe their famed lifetime warranty service is not all `` cracked up '' to what it should be and I hate to think if I ever owned one and it needed repair that it is being repaired by people who do n't care for their product or have been working there too long ( maybe a lifetime ) and have only daily contempt for it.Currently looking for a new audiophile headphone to replace these . Though I doubt I can find an electrostatic one in this price range . It was an excellent value . Too bad ! I have not commented on the sound since it is an already `` proven '' electrostatic . But if it is something that is not reliable and the service behind it is the same , this puts it in a `` useless '' category that is not even worth commenting about its purpose.PROS : Excellent Value ( when it works ) Includes everything to play or connect with.It 's portable.Comes with a quality real leather carry-all bag.Lifetime Warranty Service ( in name only ) Longtime manufacturing record of ESP with no changes to model.It is comparable or better to the Stax headphones.CONS : Lifetime Warranty Service ( You 'll go broke using this unreliable service . See below ) .Shipping cost plus Koss repair fee can be prohibitive and a deal breaker if not fixed correctly the first time.Poor 2nd tier customer care ( less ) service both via their no response e-mail service and phone.Manual is just a single semi-gloss fold out paper ( no color ) , no wonder they trashed it ! Comes unsealed in an ill-fitting box.Some quality control issues.COMMON PROBLEMS : Rust on the Gold Logos.Headband can be hard to attach to earphones.CONCLUSION : Buy these headphones only from the factory . You pay a lot more but it will be guaranteed brand new . I would recommend these headphones only to those that just want extreme low distortion and a very flat response up and down the bandwidth and understand how this applies to the music you will listen to and do n't mind an unreliable repair department for a lifetime .	-1
bought this one for $ 15 . After 10 minutes of use , the smoothness of the trackball was gone ; made it useless . Threw away in trash next day . Do n't buy it .	-1
Microsoft should really take a lesson from Logitech here . I tried the Trackball Explorer as a replacement for my WELL worn Logitech Marble-Man FX ( discontinued - though I 'll never understand why . ) My hands are M/L - totally typical.After 1 hour of use , my thumb was killing me . You see , you must reach BACK to far to hit the thumb button . If you compare it to logitech , you 'll see that they have the buttons in-line with the ball or just under where your thumb falls naturally , meaning you can click on them without bending your thumb at all.The mouse is accurate , and the ball feels nice , but you have to use those buttons ... and they are awful . If they 'd move them forward about 1 '' this would work as well as the Logitech MarbleMan FX does.It 's no wonder those things are going for $ 150 USED on Ebay ... Logitech had it right and nobody has yet repeated it .	-1
The WDT11 will work if you buy the WPC11 version 1 . The problem is , no one sells the WPC11 version 1 . The current version of WPC11 is version 3 , and Linksys customer service told me that version 3 does n't work with the WDT11 ( it works fine in a laptop ) . Linksys customer service recommended the newer WMP11 card which is made for desktops . This WDT11 is an adapter to get the laptop peripheral WPC11 to work in a desktop .	-1
I agree this is a solid cookware . But it is so hot on the handles everytime I try to remove it from the stove . I believe they can do something about the design of the handles . BTW , my hands are not so sensitive to heat normally . But this is super hot beyond my tolerance .	-1
I bought the eTrex Legend three years ago to replace an older model that I passed on to my son . The price was right and it came with Garmen 's software , a car lighter power cable and a protective case . A big improvement was the ability to run the unit off of the car 's DC power while driving toward the final location and then run off of battery while on foot . However , I did notice that it seemed to be less capable of getting a good signal and would frequently bounce all over the place in the woods . Now it has a propensity to lock up after a few minutes of usage . I 've read from earlier postings that this has something to do with outdated WAAS protocols . Clearly if this is not something that Garmen has fixed in the firmware , the product will be useless . I found that the only way to unlock the unit was to remove the battery cover and pull out a battery and replace it . Sometimes the `` reboot '' and reacquire process takes a longer period of time than the unit will function before locking up again . I am now looking for another replacement , hopefully one that will make it easier to go paperless .	-1
It 's very simple , everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this SD Card , 4 USB sticks , 1 Hard DRive , and 1 CF card . Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache .	-1

I work in the computer section of a mid-sized printing company , and I also do a lot of web work on the side , so I see a lot of different , and at some points odd ) ways to store media.I bought my external 250 drive a few months ago , along with 9 disks to go with it ... all of which ( drive and disks ) are sitting on a shelf collecting dust.This drive does not work well personally , or professionally , whether you want to reuse it a million times , or store important back-ups . The disks are not dependable enough to rely upon to keep long term back-ups , constant use corrupts the disks , and forget about sending them through the mail ! No matter how careful you are in packaging them , chances are you 'll get a few back with messages saying & quot ; I ca n't open most of the files , they 've gone bad & quot ; .Buy a CD writer , test your CDs before you give them to someone else , and you wo n't have any problems , mail them ... step on them ... pour some soda on them ... as long as you do n't play hockey with them , or melt them , you 'll be OK .	-1
OK , what do you do when you need a PDA and you do n't have a lot of cash ? You buy this completely forgettable Palm device , use it as a stop-gap measure until you can afford a decent Pocket PC or Linux based PDA . Palm has pefected the calendar and address book features of their handhelds ( they thought them up and have the most practice after all ) , but the lack of versatility and connectivity with other windows programs makes this Palm a sorry purchase .	-1
This item was such a HUGE disappointment . Initially , it worked well . BUT the more it was used ( we are only talking 50 rolls or so ) the more it started to deteriorate . First came the noises . Then the grinding . Then the failures to load film . Forget trying to load the rolls of 40 pictures , it would bring this thing to a grinding halt in many cases . This thing was only built to scan maybe 25-50 rolls tops . Read the reviews on other websites . Others have had the same thing happen . Inevitable failure . AND this is my SECOND one , both with the same result . For Nikon to release such a poorly constructed product is surprising . Especially since the scanner ( I have the Coolscan V ) it goes in is actually a well built and excellent product.Bottom line ... WAY too much money for a hunk of plastic with such poor construction . It will do the job if it is a small one ( 25-to 50 rolls , keep the number of rolls of 40 pictures to a minimum ! ) . Be prepared to use that warranty and send it back to Nikon at least once or twice . And wear a headset , becuase that grinding squeaking noise as it rolls your film out is unbearable !	-1
After a lot of research I bought this unit rather than others from well known electronics brands , with a lot of trust and excitement . Mi RioVolt worked fine for a short while then started showing problems reading burnt CDs it used to play fine . I upgraded the Firmware to latest verion 2.10 and the probles worsened . After many hours of testing all conceivable settings and brand media wasted , ( both CD-R and CD-RW ) I contacted Tech support to get an answer that my unit was fine ( how can they tell ? ) and the problem was with the burner . Many hours and tests with burners later , my Rio does not work at all and am waiting for a reply from Rio .	-1
If you really need an *MP3* boombox , this seems to be the best of the bunch : it plays MP3s well . The sound quality , though , is very poor compared to comparably-priced boomboxes ( with regular CDs ) : annoyingly bright , hard , and distorted highs that make it unpleasant to listen to for long . The AM and FM reception is poor . There 's no tone controls , no anti-skip protection , no way to power it in a car , and no audio out or headphone jacks for other speakers or dubbing.In short , you 're trading off features and sound quality for MP3 playback . Without MP3 playback , this is a very attractive ... boombox.I bought this to provide background music for my massage therapy practice . On synthesized music without vocals , the sound is tolerable , and the ability to put 10 hours of music is very nice indeed . But I regret buying it .	-1
Would be nice if it worked . Tried everything my Pentax K-x manual indicated that I should do and still no action . Not impressed . Perhaps a two pound mason 's hammer would do the trick .	-1
This card worked fine for a while , a couple of months , in my Minolta Dimage 7 . Then , for no apparent reason , it would hold only a few more images than a SanDisk 64 MB card I have .	-1
I thought a media card like this would be foolproof . No ! I was on a hiking trip and took many pictures . All of a sudden , my camera could not function properly . After `` thinking '' for a long time , the camera showed `` CF Read Error '' .I went home and plugged the card into the CF Card Reader . The light on the Card Reader was always on and Windows could not read it.I reached the conclusion that it must have died ! It lost all my images ! I have owned 3 other cards with smaller capacity of course . None of them gives me any problem ! I will never go for this brand again .	-1
I bought this card to go with my Nikon 4300 . It worked fine for about 6 months . Now , although I can continue to take photos , I ca n't get them off the card my any means . PC ca n't read or even format the card.Do n't waste your money here ! As an update , I went to the Viking website and noted that they have a 5 year warranty . It was very easy to return , and Viking sent me a new one within a few weeks . So far , so good ...	-1
Well I too am a victim of the H03 ( or H02 , I 'm not sure I understand what the codes are ) . Well the good news , is I came to amazon.com to print my invoice and check the warranty on this POS . When I started reading the ratings , I decided to take the cover off . Procedure : Took off the cover and gently spun the mechanism . Plugged in ; NOTHING . Spun the mechanism while plugged in ; NOTHING . Then I just gently tapped on the `` white circle '' about three times and BOOM its all working again.I had to go to 2 stars though because I have gotten about 5k hours out of this player . With four kids , who refuse to turn the thing off when they leave 5 minutes into the movie , it has done some serious work for my family . But this is still unacceptable ... especially when you consider I have a $ ... .APEX that has about 20k hours on it and has not bobbled.Good luck , Dr . Kevlar	-1
For some reason , I ca n't get more than ten feet away without the unit without getting a warning that my network connection 's been lost . I 've tried updating the firmware , power-cycling , etc . Nothing works . Maybe this is an exception rather than the rule , but their customer service [ is bad ] too . I tried everything they suggested , and nothing worked . I wanted an exchange , but I still have the old unit .	-1
I bought two of these routers brand new , and a family member bought one as well . ALL 3 of them are defective . If a computer on the network reboots , the routers compeltely shut down . Also many services , like email , would not work through the router . It makes little sense . But these routers are junk , they simply wo n't work , and I reccomend everyone AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS . You might as well go buy a brick , it will work just as well on your network . ( NOT AT ALL ! )	-1
I work as a computer tech , have always had good experience with Linksys products , bought this item without doing any research . Soon after hooking it up I started experiencing the frequent disconnects others have been complaining about . Please note that this only seems to be the case with the current ( Sept. 2003 ) model , listed as ... wireless b , v4 . The item pictured on Amazon is the older , working model . The one you will get is a slimmer , smaller , non-working version 4 . I started searching the web for answers and found out that everyone with this version is having problems . Please avoid this product until Linksys gets this right . Apparently they tried to cut costs on this model and made a major revision of the hardware , well it DOES N'T work ! I finally bought an older version on ebay and it worked right out of the box and it is still working , not one disconnect ! The version 4 I bought from Amazon is going back to Linksys , hopefully I will get a fixed , working one in return . This is a non-workingh product , I know what I 'm doing and I could n't keep it connected for more than an hour or two , do not buy this product unless you need the extra aggrevation in your life ! UPATE : October , 2004 - It seems Linksys has fixed the problems with this router , the replacement router I received from Linksys was the same model , but it seems to work fine . We have also recommended this model to people at work for use at home with their broadband connections , no one seems to be having problems now . My faith in Linksys is restored ! I ca n't change the star rating , but I would give it 4 stars now if I could .	-1
I have been using the Linksys BEFSR41 DSL/cable router for 8 months and loved it . I purchased the BEFW11S4 to roam around the house using my Dell laptop . I also looked at the WAP11 . The price of the BEFW11S4 ( after $ 30 rebate ) and the WAP11 was the same price on Amazon , so I decided to purchase the all-in-one BEFW11S4.I should have paid closer attention to the negative reviews . This unit has caused me grief ever since I received it . The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the latest version . Configuration was easy . It did not take long to get connected to the Internet through the RJ-45 ports , but it was horrible ever since I got it connected.I successfully connected three computers ( two desktops and one laptop ) using the 4-port router . I tried to connect wirelessly . After a lot of troubleshooting , I finally did a soft reset ( hit the button on back of unit for 1 second ) . The wireless worked . I used the wireless in various parts of my house and was disappointed in the range . It only worked up to 40 feet away . The connection speed was good at 40ft.I then tried to connect to the Internet using one of my other PCs connected through the hub ( non-wireless ) . It would not work . Again , I figured out the only way to get the PC to connect to the Internet was to do another soft reset of the Linksys . My PC got connected , but the wireless would not work . I tried many different scenarios , but the wireless would not work at the same time as my desktop PC . I wasted a lot of time.I called Linksys tech support and after I explained to him my experiences , he asked me to do a couple things . The changes I made were all unsuccessful . He told me that I can ship the unit to Linksys and they will ship me a new one . He explained the return process to me : I will receive an email within 3 business days to describe how I can return the unit , I have to ship it back to Linksys ( I am responsible for the shipping costs ) , and they will send me a new unit . The entire process will take 15 business days . I was SHOCKED ! I had the unit for one day and I have to be without one for three weeks . On top of it , I have to pay for the shipping.I never did get an email from Linksys and it has been 6 business days . I am sending it back to Amazon ... and will buy another brand . A friend really likes his D-Link router/wireless unit . He also has much greater range.My advice is to pay close attention to the reviews . I wish I would have . I could have saved myself many hours of frustation ...	-1
This item was a big headache . I had big hopes for this Linksys item , but it let me down big time . It frequently terminated the internet connection . It seemd to be periodically automatically releasing and renewing the IP settings . Could n't stay connected to AOL thru TCP/IP for more than a few minutes at a time without getting booted off . At least three times a day , the internet connection would be completely dead , and the router and cable modem would have to be powered down and powered back up to re-establish the internet connection . After reading many message boards , and seeing lots of people had the same problem with Linksys routers ( not just this model ) , I sent this back.I got a Belkin F5D6231-4 wireless router as a replacement for about 90 bucks . It 's been working great with none of the problems I experienced with the Linksys router.My advice is to go with the Belkin router , or try one of the Netgear models .	-1
I am a cable modem user in a four bedroom house.The wired/wireless functions have been working fine except for the following items : Client/server multiplayer gaming does not function . Games life Half-life , Counterstrike , etc that use UDP packets will freeze the device requiring a poweroff or reset . I 'm sure a patch will come out eventually but this is a showstopper for me . I can work around it by using the Linksys just as a hub and putting another router in front , but I wanted to get rid of the other devices.Range was a little disappointing . Long file transfers from the living room are iffy . Makes playing MPEG4 files onto the digital TV problematic.I have since gotten rid of the Linksys and bought a SMC 7004AWBR . The gaming works and I get slightly better range.Have not tried the VPN passthrough options for either device.Final recommendation . If you are set on a Linksys , wait until they patch it completely . If you ca n't wait , get an SMC . ( note : there is an older SMC model . The newer one has the ports on the back and looks more stylish ( rounded ) , but the lights are less useful/harder to see ) . If you could use the convenience of a print server , get the SMC . If you have an external modem , you can plug that into the SMC for your connectivity . And the SMC is usually cheaper .	-1
Case Logic cases used to have 3-ring binders . When you wanted to remove a page of discs , you just popped it open and put it into another binder wherever you wanted . Now , with their ridiculous quick-lock system ( or whatever the name is that some bozo in marketing made up ) , if you want to move a page , you have to remove ALL THE PAGES THAT COME BEFORE IT ! And these are n't holes in the pages , these are SLITS ! It 's made organizing my collection a miserable activity.And why did they make this change ? Because it 's undoubtedly cheaper to make a binding system out of plastic than it is out of metal . And by boasting about the new system , they further insult our intelligence by pretending that it 's more desirable and functional than their previous system . It 's not . It 's better than a case in which you ca n't remove the pages at all , but that 's about it . Case Logic cases are otherwise well made , but this one flaw/change , especially after they 'd gotten us used to the three-ring binders , is infuriating .	-1
I would have to agree with some of the other reviews . I have some older Caselogic CD/DVD cases that are far better quality than this one . It is just so cheaply made . It seems to be just thin plastic . I doubt this case will hold up very long . At $ 30 it is grossly overpriced . $ 10 would have been about right.Caselogic is apparently in financial trouble . When companies start changing to cheap materials and workmanship , it can only mean one thing . They are in bad shape , financially , and are trying to cut corners while still charging the same prices . In the end , the customers suffer and the company inevitably goes out of business anyway.One lesson that other companies can learn from Caselogic 's mistake is that if you manufacture high-quality products and charge a fair price , even if that price might seem a little on the high side , customers will still buy the products and the company will continue to thrive . There is no point in trying to save a few pennies here and there , because it will cost you mega-bucks in the end.In the end , I guess I will keep the case , since it is too much trouble to return it . This will be the last Caselogic item I will ever buy . I am no longer a customer of theirs , I am a victim !	-1
This unit comes in two detachable halves : the front half which contains the player , controls , and internal memory , and the back which contains the combined external memory and battery . The front is a beautiful work of art , the back piece is a TOTAL DISASTER : The back is a permanent ( they say ) NiMH battery and 128mb memory fused together at a [ high ] price ( to buy spares ) . These external tunes will cost you ... per hour to store -- I can buy 128mb Smartmedia ... so what gives ? The battery and charging system have some major issues which I got past because I 'm mechanically inclined . I think most of those units being returned do not have defective batteries -- the battery is either not seated correctly , or the charging routine misread the charge state and needed to be rerun , or people unplugged them from the initial charge too early . They should have just provided a loose NiMH battery and left the battery choice up to the owner . This is a public relations nightmare . The battery *does* come out even though they tell you not to remove it . They are the same as what works in my digital camera.I predict these backs will be redesigned . Or perhaps a third party could do it better and cheaper.Save for the above problems , this is a very nice player in form and function . The sound is great and the player controls are almost perfect . A minor problem is they need a better way to rearrange the play order of the tunes in-player . The included headphones look like they were designed for a the head of a space alien ( the ear-pieces are pointing in a funny direction ) . Expect to replace them.The PC software : I do n't want mp3 software that is chock full of obtrusive ads and nag screens ( like real junkbox ) , I just want a simple window container that I can drag and drop tunes to AND from . Why cant this software extract from the player as well as write to it ? My main requirement was solid-state memory . I was mislead by many of the tech sites that listed the Rio as being able to accommodate Compactflash external memory so I dont know if I will keep this one . If they had a back that took Compactflash or Smartmedia and a generic AA slot , it would be the perfect player .	-1
I just had a bad experience with a brand new Rio 800 , went back to the store in 24 hours . ( ... ) It seems there is a reason Rio is trying to move them . Their tech support lines seem to be jammed too . Seems they have been knowingly shipping units with bad chargers that may permanently damage the unit , and even my 'new ' charger doesnt work.Here 's my disgruntled letter to Rio support : -- -I am returning my Rio 800 player I bought yesterday for many reasons.When I took it out of the case and read the charging directions , there was a slip of paper saying that if the charger did n't look like the charger in the picture , not to use the device until Rio ships a new one.First , if there is someone taking the time to put the slip of paper in the case , that person should instead be checking the power supplies and exchanging them in the box before shipping the product . If the new power supplies are not ready , then you should n't be shipping units for Christmas that can not work without them until they are . I would have been infuriated if I had given this as a Christmas gift and the recipient had to wait a week for a charger to play with it . Why not just ship stockings with coal ? Quality-control is a job your employees do at packing time , not your customers.Luckily I *had* a charger that looked like one in the picture , as best as I could figure . You do n't specifically mention on the sheet what to look for to tell if you have a new charger , and you do n't provide a picture of the old charger for comparison . I assumed that since the small nub jutting out beside the jack was unique , that that was what I was looking for , so I went ahead and conditioned the unit , per instructions , because I had such a charger.Well , within 30 minutes the charge light went out and the condition screen went off . You mention in the instructions to make sure the charge light stays on , but provide no instructions on what to do if it goes off . Since I could not get back into the menu , I unplugged and re-plugged in the charger , and went back into the conditioning menu and continued charging . In the morning the light was off , and the unit had only 3 % charge.So I called the technical support number on the package , and this is where I ceased to become a Rio customer . I had to navigate a long and borish IVR system , riddled with tales of online customer support ( I think I have 3 completely different email addresses for your support , including riohome.com , diamondmm.com , and sonicblue.com ) , other products , and even specific mentions of solutions for problems and products I did not have . When I finally got to the end , I was told not only were the customer support reps busy , but I would not even be put on hold . No queue times , no hold music , no nothing - just 'go away'.Companies have an obligation to customers to have a concise IVR system , appropriately staffed lines , and to allow a caller to remain on hold and be kept advised automatically of their place in queue and expected hold times . These IVR features have been around for a while . You sell a hardware product - if you arent going to help me fix a problem quickly over the phone , back to the store it goes . I am not going to sit around and wait for email support.Anyways , back to the store , one more lost Christmas sale .	-1
This is the 4th Rio product in my household . I bought a Rio500 , my wife has a Rio500 and now I have the Rio800 . We also very briefly had a RioVolt 90 CD player . The quality on all 4 products has been abysmal . The Rio800 has rechargable batteries which they claim have 11 hours of use between charges . 5 hours is more like it for the first 6 months , now it 's about 4 hours ( a little over a year old ) . There is no option for replacing the battery . I 've also noticed after a year of use ( now out of warranty ) , I get these bizzare screeching or warbling noises in the middle of playing music or audio books . Now the thing stopped working all together . The features of this product were right on target , but Rio really has a lot to learn about quality .	-1
... After some research I determined that instead of pulling wires through the walls and playing around with things like that I was going to go the easy way . I found out about wireless networking . I looked into it and discovered that Linksys had the fastest wireless capabilities.Though it was nothing special it could go up to 11 MB/s if the computers were within 100 feet of each other . Further away and the service dramatically declined . But it was easy , just install the software , hook up the components and I was ready . Or so I thought . This begins that drama play titled `` Norwaynick vs. the wireless network. '' ... I was very eager to get it home and set it up . I sat down in front of the computer and opened the packages.Inside I found instructions and the products . First I read the instructions to set up the access point . The access point was what was supposed to send out the signals to the little stations which would be at every computer . From the beginning my experience was poor . The instructions were very difficult to follow despite the fact I know quite a bit about computers.When I did get the access point installed and hooked up I went on to the little `` stations '' or wireless USB network adapters . I had to install all of these , which were also difficult to follow and then plug them in.Finally , a few hours later everything was done , or so I thought . I went to try it out on the computer that powered the access point first . Success ! It worked and the speed was just as usual , although here the access point and station were just a foot apart but it made me very hopeful.On to the next station . I went to my next computer . No signal . The signal was not being received and when it was it was only 10 % . It needed atleast 80 % to work properly . The same thing followed on all the rest . I was so unhappy . All of the computers were easily within 100 feet of the access point and according to the box the signal could stretch to 1500 feet . So what was the problem.I went back to the one that did work and after a little inspection I uncovered an very disappointing fact . The wireless was not working there . Instead the cable wire was going from the cable modem , into the access point and then to the computer , by the USB wire that was supposed to configure the access point to that computer . If I unplugged the USB network adapter ( or the little station ) everything still worked fine because I was sending it to the computer via wire . ... Moral of the story . Do n't go wireless with networking yet . Everything else might be wireless but this just is n't dependable . I would never recommend using this to anyone so save yourself the hours and money and either put in the ethernet wires or hire someone to do it.PS : Now I have the house wired with ethernet cables .	-1
I bought this USB adapter to connect a second Tivo to my home network . Tivo is VERY fussy and requires the 2.6 version of the WUSB11 . The Amazon.com picture appears to be the ver 2.6 adapter , but the adapter I received has different markings . My old WUSB11 has the version on the outside of the box , but this one did not . I called Linksys , and they could n't determine the version number . They guessed it was 2.6 . So , I disconnected my old WUSB11 from my networked Tivo and connected the new adapter . It was not recognized . I rebooted , no better . I reconnected the old WUSB11 , the one from the box marked ver 2.6 , and it worked immediately . I suspect that Amazon now has a different version ( 2.8 ? ) , and it Tivo does not like it . If you are buying a WUSB11 adapter for your Tivo make sure it is ver 2.6 , or it probably wo n't work .	-1
I bought this to replace my Palm TX , which will not work on Windows 8.1 . I can not synchronize that Palm with my desktop using Windows 8.1 . I do not seem to be able to use the PalmOne m500 by itself or synchronize it with my computer , so it is gathering dust in a drawer .	-1
I owned a terrific Palm V which I dropped and destroyed by accident . Then I bought an m500 . What a mistake . It has been nothing but problems.I had the same problems as everybody else with the USB cradle not Hotsynching . I tried resetting the handheld several times and eventually it came back on . But what a royal pain . Also , the battery has been a problem too . For two weeks I could n't get a charge to hold . Again , hard resetting it over an over helped.This device cost far too much to behave this way . Tech support was limited and not helpful . I wo n't buy another Palm device .	-1
Purchased from Amazon 2001 in Florida . My Palm m505 arrived shortly after I ordered it , however there was no stylus as advertised and the software was pirated from the original on a used CD in a dirty case - did you think I would n't notice the `` M505 driver '' handwritten across the CD in magic marker ? Also this Palm arrived dead as a doornail and had to be recharged . So nice of you to send the cradle you promised . Now I 'm off to buy a stylus and a manual , since the software contains nothing in the way of startup and care instructions for this thing .	-1
This product has excellent features but my unit will not finalize most discs after recording . Most of the popular blank audio CDR discs such as Maxell , Memorex , Fuji , Verbatim , etc . are not compatable with this machine . However , it will usually function with TDK discs.I contacted Phillips about repairs ( unit is still under warrenty ) . ... If you buy this machine , be VERY careful to QUICKLY and thoughly test its operation using several varieties of blank audio CDRs . ...	-1
We got a CEIVA for our kid 's grandmother , concept was great but the unit died two times and it takes weeks to get it repaired . Due to her age , she was not tech savvy so had to have someone else come over to work on it , pack and ship , reinstall , etc . Disappointing but was the only long distance photo option I could find - will be looking for a more reliable option.HH	-1
Great idea ! ! Lousy execution ! ! Bought the unit , tried to register , could n't because of duplicate serial number . Waited until Monday ( no weekend tech support ) Called , waited 40 minutes , they send another . Does n't work , have to wait until Monday ... again.When the get the bugs worked out it will be a great idea ! !	-1
I bought this for my family in Puerto Rico . When they came to the mainland for a visit , we set it up in the guest room for them . It certainly impressed them , as it seemed to be user-friendly and just kept flashing pictures of those grandkids . From the transmitter end ( i.e . the sending PC ) , I found it a little cumbersome ( and slow ) to upload 10 pictures , even on a fast ISDN connection . Looking at the Ceiva screen myself , I would say it looks like a small , early laptop-grade image , and suffers badly at even 30 degree angles . It also washes out in any bright room light or indirect sunlight . All of that notwithstanding , it still seemed like a pretty good means of getting pictures of the grandkids to my in-laws without their having to do any downloading via the Internet . Then the bad news : when they got it home to Puerto Rico , it would n't work . Ceiva customer service informed me that even if we did n't mind it making a daily long distance call , the box was not set up to dial long distance ( I see where a Canadian customer has had the same experience ) . So there it sits , in Puerto Rico , USA , displaying the original 10 photos from 4 months ago , while my monthly subscription to the Ceiva service ticks away .	-1
It 's a great concept , if customer support was responsive.As of the last two weeks of December , 2001 , it is not.Unable to get through voice-call customer support.The web site is slow and loops me around endlesslywhen I attempt to purchase a subscription . Too bad .	-1
I bought mine exactly 1 year ago , and I have the same DNS complaints as everyone else . And it seemed to have cropped up after upgrading FIRMware to 1.5 from 1.2 or 1.3 half a year ago . If I am downloading or sharing something large at my max ADSL downspeed/upload , 96/640kbps , DNS failures are very common . And I frequently download from newsgroups , so this is a real issue . I imagine users realtime videa and audio will have the same problem.It is easy to setup and use , and seems to work fine as a LAN router and print server , though I have n't used it much as one . It works fine if I am not maxing my net connection.From the other reports of terrible customer service , I advise anyone to avoid this company if you have a similiarly priced alternative.It is still much than using PPPoeT dialer software that the telco gives you to access DSL without a ADSL router .	-1
I was very disappointed in the case . It is small and the pockets are too small . Business cards fit in the clear pocket but try and get them out ! Not very functional . The palm fits in akwardly and syncking it in in the case ( it is too hard to take it out ) is tough .	-1
What 's up with this ? This is the WRONG cord for the C330 - I returned it and got a refund , Amazon 's service is great as usual . So come on , fix this .	-1
I purchased this CD player to go with my JVC stereo receiver and cassette tape player . It worked for perhaps a week , and then one day out of the blue it began to skip while playing CD 's . I thought it might be the CD , being scratched or dirty , but it would skip on brand new CD 's too . The skipping , actually playing just bits of tracks before moving on to another track , continued all day long . No matter what I did , the problem continued . The next day , the unit worked fine again , at least for awhile , and then it started skipping again intermittently . It got so unreliable that I finally sent it back , under warranty , to JVC . They supposedly `` fixed it '' and sent it back to me , with no description of what was done . I used the player several times before the skipping problem began again . I sent the unit back to the factory , and they sent it back to me telling me that it was no longer under warranty ! I tried calling JVC headquaters and left messages for them to call , but never got a call back . I finally gave up on all JVC products . Therefore , I can not recommend this product to anyone . It is just too unreliable and the customer service is terrible . I would not even give this CD player one star , but that is the least amount of rating I can give it .	-1
Just like all the other reviews , it started skipping like crazy after 1 week . Sometimes it would work fine , and then it would go crazy and start skipping like it was in fast forward mode or something . It even skipped on brand new CD 's ! I am in the process of returning this junk to Amazon . I think I 'll get a Pioneer CD changer instead , they are supposed to be the best . Do yourself a favor and do n't buy this piece of junk . I 'm VERY dissapointed in JVC .	-1
It ruined 4 of my CDs ! It has this white circle thing on the CD that will not come off ! I went to my local music store , and they said the Skipdoctor took plastic off of the CD itself . Though , I bought it at Best Buy , which of course they basically do n't return anything . Bad ! Just go to your dollar store a few blocks down and get bathroom disinfecting wipes . They will give more satisfaction than this CD ruiner will !	-1
I gave these to my sister in-law because she needed speakers . I was not happy with the sound quality , and $ 20 Logitechs sound better and take less space	-1
these ca n't hold much sound . Though the bass speaker is cool and on-light is cool , they just do n't come through with the sound I was hopping for . I bought another pair of speakers which i recommended above to buy instead which are $ 1 more , but are what I use as my stereo speakers now ! I 'd leave these alone - they 're too delicate and though they look cool , the do n't sound cool .	-1
I bought the MDR-NC5 headphones for a trip from SF to Chicago , and they were sorely disappointing ... . I thought that I would get noise reduction and better sound quality . This is not the case.Sound : - With noise-cancelling off , the headphones sound terribly weak and thin . They sound no better than my $ 15 Sony in-ear headphones . There is no bass response on these headphones.- With noise-cancelling on , the headphones managed to block out about 50 % of the airplane noise . However , there was still a significant amount of rumble noise . Sound quality was still thin , but prevailed over the cabin noise due to the noise cancellation feature . The headphones have an on-ear design , so it lets in a lot more noise than models that cover and surround your ears completely.Comfort : - These headphones press directly on ear . The earpads are padded , but the headband is not padded . After an hour , I started to feel a bit of soreness on my ears because they pressed a little too hard on them.The few positives : - Compact . They fold up ( which is why the headband is n't padded ) , and they fit easily into your carry-on luggage.- Price . They are somewhat cheap for noise-cancelling headphones . But as my review implies , you get what you pay for.- Circuitry : All the electronics ( including the on/off switch are located on the headphones , and not on a box between the headphones and the plug.I might have been more satisfied with these headphones , except that I shared my connecting flight with my brother who has the Bose QuietComfort headphones ... . I tried those headphones out , and they are absolutely amazing . They fully cover your ears , have a padded headband , sound much better , and block out substantially more noise than the Sony MDR-NC5 . The trade-offs are that they have the intermediate box that houses the batteries and the noise-cancellation switch and that they are not very compact . Having tried the Bose model , I realize the full potential of noise-cancelling headphones and the cost associated with them . You definitely get what you pay for in these situations.I discourage anyone from buying these headphones . Please spend more money for better models ... . I am going to try out the Sony MDR-NC20 headphones which have an over-the-ear design , so they *should* provide better blocking of external noise .	-1
This VCR is absolutely terrible . I can hardly distinguish between shows recorded in the SP mode from the EP mode . They just look bad . Another annoying thing is with pre-recorded tapes . The auto tracking does not pick up the hi-fi track . I always have to adjust the VCR manually to get the hi-fi Stereo track . This is very annoying . Who cares that it rewinds pretty fast ? The picture stinks and I always have to get up and adjust the tracking . What is going on with SONY ? They used to make some of the best VCRs . I 'm sorry but this VCR is junk	-1
I 've had mine for about 4 months and now the picture jumps as it seems the tape is dragging . I took out a tape and looked at it and it 's been creased on the bottom . Not very good quality and it 's ruined a few of my tapes . I say stay away	-1
I tried to install one of these for a friend with a Technics Receiver , and the thing just did not work . Customer support claimed that I needed an optical cable , and that actually did worst . I am not sure if the unit was bad or if there is a compatibility issue , but what I do know is that THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON ON THE REMOTE . We could not understand that , how inconvenient . I am sure you would be better served buying a DVD/CD changer for a similar price . Atleast that was the advice I gave my friend.UPDATE : The problem was the receiver , so the cd player may actually be OK . I am still quite disappointed with the remote . From looking at the other reviews , I would still pass it by , and I am still leaving it at 1 star due to the remote .	-1
I got this the other day from Amazon , it was one of their re boxed units for $ 39.99 . Luckily I did n't pay more for this . I trust Sony so hopefully it will last for awhile . The description said minor damage to packing box ... this unit is warped/bowed on the top . I am using this in a garage so I will just keep it as there are no more $ 39.99 ones left . Sure wish Amazon would have been truthful with their description . I did try playing one CD and it worked fine . Hopefully it will last for awhile .	-1
These batteries are the sole reason I will never buy another Canon camera . I love my camera , but these batteries are over-priced and have a short lifespan . I 've been through four of these in the last couple of years , and part of the reason why is because they 're Lithium Ion . For the longest life , Lithium Ion batteries need to be topped off as often as possible , and should never be allowed to discharge completely ( every deep discharge cycle lowers the life of the battery considerably , and after 100 cycles , the average Li-Ion is at 75-85 % of original capacity ) . So , generally speaking , Lithium Ion is a lousy choice for a camera . Who takes ten shots and then tops off the battery ? NiCad is a FAR better choice for a camera , since NiCads SHOULD be completely discharged on a regular basis . I spent a few hundred dollars on the camera , and I 'm well on my way to spending an equivalent amount on batteries . That 's absurd . I bought another brand of camera recently that uses standard AA batteries , and I 'm much happier with it . I use NiCads instead of the Li-Ions it came with , and they 're working great . Proprietary batteries s*ck .	-1
I bought this product about a year ago because of its router and bridge function , and presumably Linksys reputation . I wanted to network my two kids ' computers at the other end of the house through the phoneline . I have the Netgear PA-301 card ( a great product ) in their computers . Installation of the HPRO200 was easy , but performance poor . My connection speed ( both ethernet and phoneline ) dropped sharply and became slightly better than my old 56k . Linksys tech support which was very marginal , ( took several phone calls and a run around between markedly different 2 cents opinions ) , finally after reaching someone who knew , advised me to upgrade the firmware . That part actually was easy and improved the speed some , but still slow . Linksys finally admitted this was a known issue with this product and were `` working '' on newer upgrades `` at some point in the near future '' . Fortunately , I was still within my 30 days , and returned it for a refund . Instead I got a separate router ( D-link DI704 ) & phoneline bridge ( Netgear PE102 ) , both of which work great . Maybe you will have better luck than me , but I can not recommend this Linksys product .	-1
Despite 10 hours of work , I was unable to get this unit to work.I followed all of the advice that other reviewers posted - upgraded the driver/firmware , rebooted the router/system , etc . Nothing . I have a laptop that connects to a wireless network at my office and its WAN monitor utility showed an erratic signal strength coming from the DI-713P . I was never able to get the D-link DWA-500 card to receive anything at all , even when I moved the host computer right next to the router . Eventually , the unit started failing when it attempted to get a DHCP address from the cable company . Rebooting and other voodoo practices had no effect - I was now totally off the network ! I think I 'm going to bite the bullet and start routing wires in my wall so I can get a reliable connection to my machine upstairs.I do n't think this router is ready for prime time .	-1
I was going to replace my reliable old Linksys non-wireless router with this D-Link one . I chose it partly because of the integrated print server.In general it worked fine for most applications . However , I also use it to access my company 's network from home using VPN . This did not work well . I tried both wired and wireless modes for this with no improvement . I was n't able to download anything other than small files and it had trouble getting updates from the corporate email server.I tried working with customer support but they were n't able to help.I switched to the new Microsoft wireless router and it works fine and is much easier to setup .	-1
This radio receives AM , FM and all seven weather alert VHF channels . Notably it does have an alert mode where audio is muted until the homeland security folks or NWS sends an alert tone that will activate the radio 's alarm.It may be powered by 4 AA batteries or by a supplied wall power supply ( UL listed ) . It has a about a 20 inch telescoping antenna . It is available from a number of sources in the $ 18 to $ 25 range.Overall audio quality is sufficient and clear for this small radio.AM reception is poor : poor sensitivity and selectivity . Yet it will receive the major AM stations so long as they are moderate in strength or better . Forget weaker stations.FM is better with more reasonable sensitivity and selectivity . I was able to receive and separate a dozen or more FM stations in my above average FM rf strength area.My local NWS channel ( 4 ) was received adequately Sensitivity is probably average at best . So it will likely not receive the weaker NWS signals . I 've not yet observed the alert function sound off . ( Which is my main reason for acquiring this radio . ) Quality of construction appears to about what you would expect for the price ( cheap ! ) . I paid about $ 18 plus shipping . The performance is about what I expected .	-1
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Bottom-line -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Nikon should either retire this lens or drastically reduce its price. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Performance at each stop -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- * f/2This lens is unusable at f/2 . Very low resolution and poor contrast all over . Chromatic aberrations ( CA ) are pervasive from the center to the edges . It will ruin any picture . * f/2.8The center performance improves drastically . Contrast goes up noticeably and CA goes down to very low levels ( still there ) . The mid-frame is still fuzzy and CA is observable . Towards the edges the fuzziness and CA is still unacceptable for a prime lens . * f/4Now center performance is impeccable . Excellent contrast and no hint of CA . The mid-frame is still somewhat fuzzy but the relative clarity and contrast is improved over f/2.8 . Unfortunately the edges still disappoint : still poor contrast and CA ( better than f/2.8 though ) . * f/5.6The center is flawless . Excellent contrast , no CA , high resolution . The edges improve dramatically : very good contrast and very little CA . The fuzziness is still there for the mid-frame ( pretty much at the same level reached at f/4 ) . * f/8Ok , now we 're talking . Excellent performance all over. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -My opinion -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -The performance of this lens is very poor below f/4 -particularly so considering it 's a prime lens . At f/2 is a mess , and at f/2.8 it 's only good in the center -quite useless for low light photography ( again , considering it 's a prime lens ) .Stopped down to f/8 this lens is very good for landscape photography -also it 's a very small and light , adding very little weight to your bag.In short : you are paying for a max aperture of f/2 when the lens is only good at f/5.6 ( maybe a third of a stop less ) and over . At the current MSRP this lens is completely overpriced . The Nikon 35 f/1.8G is far better for much less money ( yes , I know that it 's a DX lens ) . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Alternative 1 : Samyang -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Many times better than the 35 f/2d is the Samyang 35 f/1.4 ( which also goes by the name of Rockinon and Bower but it 's the exact same lens ) .The Samyang is an optical marvel which can put the equivalent Zeiss to shame . Leaving the fact that it 's manual focus ( same as Zeiss and older Nikon 35mms ) , the Samyang is the absolut bang for the buck . Nothing comes close to it . Considering it 's manual focus changes the equation a little bit and levels the playfield with the other 35 primes.If you have no problems with manual focus , if you can live with it , then the Samyang is `` the '' bargain of 35mm prime lenses and an absolute winner irrespective of the price. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Alternative 2 : Sigma -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - ( Note : I sold my Samyang to buy the new Sigma 35mm f/1.4 ) The difference between the Sigma and the Nikon is abysmal . Gigantic . Staggering.The improvement over the 35 f/2d is far beyond what you can expect from the price difference.The Sigma is sharp and contrasty @ f/1.4 . It also has less distorion , less vigneting , better contrast , and significantly less optical aberrations than the nikon 35 f/2Against the Samyang is neck to neck . Below f/2 - f/2.8 the Sigma is better . f/4 goes for the Samyang . f/5.6 and above is a tie.The big bonus of the Sigma over the samyang is the autofocus . It nails it at f/1.4 9 out of 10 times . Incredible. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Recommendation -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Save some extra money and get the Sigma 35 f/1.4 ( which is lightyears ahead of this Nikon ) .If the price for the Sigma is way above your budget , then go for the Samyang 35 f/1.4 , which is a phenomenal optical marvel -and again far , far better than this lens . The only caveat is that is manual focus only ( with green dot confirmation though ) If manual focus is not your cup of tea and do n't have the budget for the sigma , then consider a zoom lens which will give you a reasonable IQ at 35mm and additional focal lengths.If you still want to go for this lens , be warned that it has very poor IQ up to f/2.8 and only acceptable ( on average ) at f/4 -and as I said , is flawless at f/8.As of this moment I would n't pay more than $ 150 for a second hand copy of this lens . Anything above that ( given the alternatives ) is wasting your money .	-1
I wonder where to use this lens with the new and better lens in 14-24mm F2.8 ... ..this is an obsolete lens by my definition !	-1
The flash is not so reliable as it goes off just after a few shots and the battery signal indicates .	-1
It is very slow and has flare , particularly when using flash . I sacrifice the zomm and use 35-70 f2.8 instead .	-1
I cancelled this order and replaced it with the 70 - 200 mm lens . So , I can not provide any feedback on this lens .	-1
I ran Crystal Disk Info on the drive and it had over 33,000 hours on it . Worked , but that 's a lot of hours . So you do n't get confused it had over thirty three thousand hours on the drive . You can get new ones for less money on that famous bidding site . Amazon does not have new older drives . I spent hours and hours until I got smart and bought a new 160 Gig Seagate with zero hours on it at the other place to get stuff ...	-1
These drives might be `` new '' , but chances are they 've been sitting in an unopened box on a shelf for 4 years . Granted , I did expect that to be the case , but as soon as I plugged it in , it gave me the notorious death click noise . I promptly returned it and wound up buying a used one since I knew it worked upon shipping . I never bought a used hard drive but for these old ones , it might be worth it .	-1
I bought this to replace an old drive in an old dell . I opened the package the drive was poorly packaged . Then I connected it to my testing rig and ran WD 's data lifeguard diagnostics test on the drive and it failed every test . This is western digitals own hard drive testing software tests the drive at the lowest level and it failed . These are not new drives and not worth the time .	-1
I read mixed reviews , so I rolled the dice and bought these . Absolute garbage . In their little bag they are 3 & quot ; thick . They sound very quiet . No bass ( expected ) , and no Mid-range ( not expected ) . The front panel is a cheap corrugated plastic sheet . They certainly are 360 degree speakers : They sound equally bad from all directions . Even the patch cables that they provided had breaks in the cables . My original comment to my wife was & quot ; Twenty bucks , how can I go wrong ? & quot ; . Well , my answer now is I could have still had my $ 20 . Now I just have to find someone to give them to , as they are not worth the space they take up . I know you get what you pay for , but if that was the case here , then should have been on sale for half off at the 99 cent store .	-1
This camera has a very annoying problem- when you push the button to take the picture there is about a half second delay before the picture is actually taken . This is really NOT good if you are hoping to take pictures of kids , candid photos or pictures of anything in motion . Other cameras are less expensive and do n't have this horrible problem.Aside from this problem , if the picture is taken in bright light and at close range , the colors look wonderful .	-1
I 've had these headphones for about a year . And they are truly awful.They sound terrible . They buzz when noice canceling is turned on . They are very uncomfortable . And they do n't work very well at cancelling the equipment noise in my cubicle.A coworker who tried them jokingly suggested that the buzz was the & quot ; noise canceling & quot ; feature , because he could n't here the equipment fan noise in his office/lab because the buzz masked it . My experience is the buzz just adds to the noise.I 've tried to give the headphones away twice . Both times my coworkers have returned them . I 'd recommend that you seriously look at other noise canceling headphones .	-1
Cons : this camera is heavy and bulky . For the price , it is only around 2 mega pixels which isnt good . I had this camera for a while then the zoom wouldnt come all the way out and it says `` system error '' every time i turn it on so i can not use it anymore.Pros : the pictures turn out decent . It is a solid camera but do not drop it on the lens contraption because you will have the same problem of it not turning on and its garabe now .	-1
Yesterday I was going to order this card but there was a wait list . Today , now that the rebate has expired , the card ships within 24 hours . The same thing happened with the Viking 128MB SmartMedia card . Something very wrong at Amazon . Contacted customer service who were entirely not helpful , as they just espoused the company policy of offering something that they will not ultimately honor . Shame on you Amazon .	-1
I bought this specifically for Dragon Naturally Speaking . It makes a myriad of mistakes , even after spending days with it , it was still mistaken t 's for v 's and other similar mistakes . This is all after I went through 5 very long training sessions in Dragon . Do n't be fooled by the fact that 'Voice Recognition ' is in the product title , it is not a good choice unless you ONLY want to use it for Windows voice commands , which it 's able to do most of the time because there are only so many things you can say.As for audio quality , it 's OK , but not as good as a Logitec that I bought locally from Walmart . That goes for the voice recognition as well . I actually returned the Logitech specifically becuase of the positive VR reviews on this . The Logitec was by far better in both cases , yet still not good enough for VR . It 's time to buy quality , no more cheap fixes .	-1
Loved how it felt on my head - lightweight and easy to wear . It worked fine for a couple months then just quit working . It was n't like it was overworked . I used it just one day a week at our satellite office .	-1
Ok , 2 Sony SRS-P7 Passive Speakers each 2.8 inches ( w ) x 4 inches ( h ) x 2.5 inches ( d ) $ 8.50 ( amazon ) . I attempted to use these to increase the the volume on my G1 phone , however , my phone 's tiny speaker was louder than these.I also tried on other devices ( sansa mp3 player ( no speaker on device , headphone jack only ) , zen mp3 player ( headphone jack only ) , acer laptop ) and still way to low . Even my acer laptop speakers ( cheapest speakers on the planet , so I thought ) were louder than these sony passive speakers . My conclusion is the sound of them is clear , but they are passive and without power they just have no volume . I did keep them as they could come in very handy with my mp3 players that have only a headphone jack to hear radio , etc . ( especially in a power outage ) . Hope this helps others .	-1
Unit arrived in a box that was sealed with a stip of clear tape on either side looking like a 6 year old did the job . The box was sealed together so badly the tape stuck to the items inside causing you to rip everything apart . The antenna itself is just a cheap poorly painted metal rod whose thin paint arrived with a chip . As soon as the flimsy package was opened the few parts there were fell out and went about the room . 1 part never to be seen again was the tip that covers the end . As stated by other reviewers the `` rubber '' base is nothing more than rubber that is quite literally as thin as a condom . The `` decorative '' plastic piece at the base of the antenna is the same plastic you 'd see on a cheap water pistol . If I could give this cheap item a zero I would . Already bought a quality antenna elsewhere . Not worth the time and money sending it back .	-1
Antenna arrived missing the set screw used to trim and hold the antenna in place . Contacted Cobra via email about obtaining a replacement screw , but after waiting for 4 days for a response , they do NOT stock any replacement parts ! Their suggestion was to return the antenna to Amazon.Very disappointed as I have now had a new , and utterly useless , CB radio for two weeks with the prospect of at least another week going by before I can use it . When I get a replacement antenna I 'll be back and do a proper review . Just wanted to let people know if the antenna arrives missing parts or unusable for any reason , do n't bother contacting Cobra . ( And it raises questions about any warranty they may offer on this . )	-1
ProsCheap , Indestructible , Light , Blocks out external sound really well , ConsPoor sound quality , very poorly designed headband , Ear cups hurt my ears , Not comfortable , Too large , Cord extremely long.The Bottom LineThey crank out way too much bass and not enough treble . I 'd steer clear , but they are cheap and readily availableThe first indication should be the price : These headphones are only 19 dollars . It 's hard to nail down Sony 's market for these things , exactly , but judging by their appearance and `` reference headphones '' name they 're trying to pass these things off as high output sound booth style 'phones.The headphones have nice large earmuff style cups on them , with foam padding and a cloth cover . They fit my ears fine , and I have big ugly stick-out ears , so chances are these things wo n't have laws-of-physics conflicts with too many people 's ears . I did notice that the headband is a little tight and it certainly is n't very flexible . If you have a melon head you may not want to wear these for long periods of time . The headband is also very hard to adjust , at least on my pair , and is so tight it feels like I 'm about to break it every time I resize it . It does stay put very well , though , so it is likely a set-and-forget sort of thing unless multiple people will be using the 'phones.How 's the sound ? Well , it [ stinks ] . But it can be fixed . Sony boasts a bass response of 12 hz for these 'phones , which is a boldfaced lie . If you did get the cones on these things to resonate at 12 hz you certainly would n't be able to play much else through them at the same time . As far as concrete audio frequencies go these 'phones do no better than any other cheap ones on the market , but Sony decided to `` atone '' for this by jacking up the bass volume on these things to insane levels . I could n't get much else out of these headphones without creative use of a treble boost and an equalizer , and even then only at moderate volumes . It 's trendy to pack entirely more bass than you realistically need these days ( just check out just about everyone 's custom car stereos ) , but in a pair of headphones it 's ludicrous . If the audio gizmo you want to use these with does n't have good bass and treble controls , tough . In that case you are n't getting much out of these 'phones.If you can tone the bass down a bit these 'phones are average and quite suitable for non-critical listening , but professional headphones they ai n't , and accurate their sound rendition is n't , but cheap they are . I personally do n't like them a whole lot , but your mileage may vary . NOT RECOMMENDED !	-1
These headphones are truly awful . They are not worth it for any price . They sounds exceptionally bad , are not at all comfortable and do n't stay put . I replaced them withSennheiser PMX 685i SPORTS In-Ear Neckband Headphones - Blackwhich fit well in my ears , sound good and do n't shift around at all . They also have a button and a mic allowing for phone calls etc .	-1
I got this for gym use . The cable is shorted than what it should be for normal elliptical/treadmill use . Now one side stopped working . When the cable is held is one particular position , the sounds comes back indicating it 's a contact issue where the cable joins the ear piece . This ear phone is comfortable but I do not recommend it .	-1
I used these on my iPod . I also used these for running . the sound is ok . Very little bass and kind trebly . They lasted about 6 months then stopped working all the while they kept deteriorating . The cord is very thin and very weak . I stepped on it twice and the wiring became exposed . The cord ultimately looked like an electrical taped mess . The left channel stopped working after 6 months . I would n't recommend these to anyone who is going to use these for working out in any way . I suppose they are fine for commuting or general use .	-1
the head phone doesn & # 8217 ; t stay in my ears . the sound quality is just horrible . I hate this . Just put it in a box and never use it . don & # 8217 ; t waste your money on this .	-1
I purchased this headset because I wanted an over the head style because I have very small ears . It worked great with no wind . As soon as a wind gust it blew backwards . Did not work for small ears . Sound quality was good .	-1
I buy many headphones , they ALL start out fine . But after using them a couple of time for running , one of the sides stops working and they constantly shift when you run . I find it very annoying when you run , you try to concentrate on your running but instead you have to constantly fix your headphones ... I tried everything !	-1
These headphones hurt the insides of my ears and the sound quality is not the best . I would n't buy them again .	-1
Just gouging in my opinion . Bought these for a third of what is being advertised now . I highly recommend looking for something else . These are pretty cheap and certainly not worth more than $ 15 to $ 20 bucks .	-1
i really like the feel of them but i found out after i got them that i really needed a great sound . if you dont mind having not so great bass and heavy sound then you would like these . light as a feather .	-1
Just got these headphones figuring they would feel and sound like the sony walkman headsets of old but they do not . Cheap feeling plastic , thin sound , no bass and strange wire exit from the speakers make the headset a sub par replica . They are not worth a penny more than 5 bucks . Its not worth going through the hasstle of returning , so I 'll just keep them as a backup . Guess I have to deal with the modern earbud style to get decent sound quality . Oh well .	-1
still no comment not happy . I do n't want to say anything bad . So I was just saying and no , comment .	-1
If you get a digital one with a remote you don ' t have to get up to push the button to switch devices . But it works well for the price .	-1
I think this thing is a real piece of junk , it 's been a while since I bought it ( i did n't hook it up right away ) but I may try to return it . It 's looks pretty cheap , you ca n't clearly tell if you selected a speaker or not by the internal red marks in window , like solid or blank , they do n't really move that much . And now after just a few weeks the button selector is starting to not even change ( on or off ) when I push it.Other relieves of this product were good , so I took a chance on it . But I would recommend against it now .	-1
The case for this is terrible , the little snaps are extremely annoying , and they tear out within a week . So after the case broke I was using this little strap they give you , but using the strap broke off the corner by the battery case . I never dropped this or did anything that should have broken it . It is just really poorly made.That , plus the fact that you have to use MusicMatch , makes me recommend not purchasing this device . MusicMatch is a horrible program.Oh , one more thing . You can only fit about 5 songs on this the way it comes , so you have to cough up another 50 bucks for a memory card . Its not a very good deal .	-1
I bought a Rio One back in September 2001 and , at the time , felt like it was a good deal . However , since then , I have experienced two problems that lead me to strongly advise against getting this player.99 % of my use is in the car with the player hooked up to a cassette adapter , so I did n't realize how bad the sound was until I decided to use it around the house one day . The high quality ear buds that come with the Rio One were its downfall because they accurately reproduced an annoying low-frequency hum that did n't exist when playing the same MP3 files on my computer through the very same ear buds . E-mail with SONICblue tech support resulted in an RMA for a replacement unit . When I received the new one , it also exhibited the hum , so I have come to the conclusion that it 's a design flaw , and an unacceptable one at that.The second problem I 've had is downloading songs to it from a Mac running MacOS X 10.1 . Several times my Mac has gone unresponsive after dismounting the Rio One 's media , forcing me to reboot . Also , several times the songs were not cleanly downloaded , leaving portions of the previous download 's songs toward the end of the newly downloaded tracks.I have given up and replaced it with a Nomad IIc 64MB player ( which now comes with headphones , by the way , unlike the 32MB version ) . So far I 'm very impressed with it .	-1
I remember back when the ball had some mass . On this newest model the ball is so light it 's too easy to work . How is that a problem for me ? I wanted to get away from mousing on my desk . Having used the older model before I was looking forward to that familiarity . I feel it is easier to control and develop a feel for something that gives you feedback , that let 's you feel something as you work with it , not just skate away.They have gone the way of most everyone else , cheapen it up and sell it for the old price . Sorry , it is n't for me .	-1
I like the design and idea behind the mouse . Unfortunately , I feel like the track ball is a little too light as it 's lacking a solid weight to keep a steady mouse pointer . I have noticed this with several people using it .	-1
$ 44 for the wireless and $ 230 for the wired version.. What a ripoff . You 're better off with the wireless trackball .	-1
I needed a mouse alternative . This item has a major flaw . The track ball is slippery and to light . I lack a lot of precision that I would get with track ball with a grip coating . I need to press hard on the ball to get it working and the motion is not fluid . I do not like this item .	-1
we 're constantly needing to reboot this gadget after it declines to transmit packets . we suspected the dhcp server but switching to static addresses did n't fix it . it clicks all the time . why ? it 's powered by a wallwart . what is clicking ? the o/s is pathetic . the u/i poor . contrary to an earlier reviewer ( who probably did n't rtfm ) it does offer a firewall , which runs entirely steath ( checked against dslreports and grc ) .still , we wo n't buy another netgear box after this shoddy experience .	-1
This is a totally counterfiet product from this seller - DO NOT BUY IT - you will not only be disappointed with it BUT Amazon will make you pay return postage even though the product is not as described ... it is listed as NIKON ( but it is totally NOT ) . Buyer beware , this item sucks and you will be ripped off.It is so far from being genuine Nikon it will make you laugh ( or cry ) . This seller needs to be blacklisted ! They are a total fraud .	-1
Do n't waste your money on this one . I purchased the SP90 for Christmas and it gave me a full 3 hours of performance before it failed miserably . I could n't figure out why . The disc kept spinning so the battery level was n't low . Only there was no music coming out of the player at all . I tried regular audio CD 's and data CD 's ( with MP3 songs ) but it still would not perform . I 've made about 150 online purchases in my life and have had to return maybe 3 items . This will be one of them.Pro'sNone , even the case looks like a toyConWhen it worked , the player skipped constantly . Unacceptable since I used to have a Panasonic CD player with 40 sec memory that never skipped on me even when jogging.In cold weather , the disc would not spin up to speed and thus would not produce music.When battery runs low , CD spins but no music producedPlayer takes forever to seek MP3's.Short battery life	-1
I love the shape of the mouse and the fact that it 's wireless . BUT ! the moment I started to use it , I noticed the sluggishness with this mouse . Too bad , I was going to fall in love with this mouse , but I ca n't stand the sluggishness as I do heavy work with computers . I do programming , so I need real quick response like wired Intelli Mouse Explorer . I 'm going to back to it right now ...	-1
Here 's the reasons why I call this a cheap plastic junk,1 . The 3 MP does n't give enough picture quality . 3MP is just a marketing thing , its actual quality is more like 2MP.2 . Visible purple fringing/ chromatic aberrations.3 . LCD monitor is not good , tough to see anything on in sunlight . Using a cheapish LCD helps drive profit margins higher for Kodak on this.4 . Unacceptable time lag when veiewing on LCD.5 . Takes more than 14 secs to write anything on the CF card . Even my last year 's camera was much better than this ! 6 . Poor viewing capabilites.7 . You need to spend lots of extra money to get its dock . Why does n't Kodak sell it along with camera itself ? After all it hardly worth 15 bucks ! 8 . Missing features like movie/audio , Video out , atleast some manual controls etc.I have compared this camera to other Canon/Sony ones and find this way below on quality/features compared to them . I see that many people here have a 5 star review for this , but then maybe its their first experience with a digicam.Kodak needs to improve the quality of their products and stop making such shabby cameras . Buy a Canon S200 or S330 or A40 and you will be much more happy . They have much more features and have very good metallic bodies . Do n't buy this plastic junk . Look all the freebies that Kodak is throwing in to sell this : ) I know I will not be very pouplar in my harsh review about this cheapie but I prefer to be candid .	-1
Bring it home . Spend two hours loading it up with songs and all you get is `` HD ERROR '' on the display . Taking it back .	-1
To its credit , the EXP201 is an inexpensive CD player that also supports CD-R 's chock full of MP3 files . It basically means that you can carry 10+ hours of tunes on a single disc and enjoy those tunes on a single set of two AA batteries . I picked up one of these units yesterday and I returned it today for the following reasons:1 . Horrible sound quality . All my MP3s exhibited a random pop , click , or some other audio artefact during playback . And no , I was n't listening to Oval , Microstoria , or any other Mego glitchery , and all these MP3s are 160 kbps CBR ( constant bitrate ) files that play with no problems in my PocketPC.2 . Stability issues . I used my unit exclusively in a car ( a Ford Taurus , in fact , sitting in the front seat armrest ) that did nothing but city driving . Admittedly , Houston streets have their share of potholes and bumps , but my wife 's VW cd changer ( which does n't have the read-ahead shock protection ) is far , far , far more stable than this player , which produced random skips with alarming regularity.3 . Navigation problems . The display on this unit is limited to numbers . Which means that when you create CD-R 's of MP3 files , you have to organize them in folders by either artist and/or album in order to be able to skip ahead albums ' worth of tracks at a time . Even at that , you 'd have to have a pretty darn good memory of what order ( let alone which artists ) the tracks were burned onto disc . Having to play 'Name That Tune ' with your own music collection is only entertaining at parties.4 . Compatibility issues . Despite the reported CD-RW compatibility , none of my DirectCD CD-RW 's would register with this unit . Also , any regular CD-R 's created using the Joliet standard ( which allows long file names ) seem to have the file orders scrambled , as the file names seem to get truncated by the player 's operating system . In order to maintain track order , I had to manually rename 140+ files in EasyCD Creator ( a bit of an oxymoron in this case ) to 8.3 standards ( trying to compose the disc in ISO9660 truncated the file names without maintaining track order ) .So , there you have it . A nice try , but poor , poor execution . From what I 've read , the EXP301 series are significantly better in sound quality , skip protection , and compatibility , so you may want to spring a few extra dollars and save yourself a potential headache .	-1
To be clear , I am a big HP fan , ( I own their laptops both at work and home ) and I 've used the Jornada 547 before I upgraded to the 568 . But I 'm VERY disappointed with the performance of the new 568 . I 've had it one week and let me tell you the glitches . First , I 've had to reset the device at least once per day . Second , sometimes it turns off/sometimes it does n't after pushing the power button . ( that is simply unacceptable ) Third , sometimes the backlight works when it 's supposed to , sometimes it does n't . The Activesync w/ Avantgo has been highly unreliable , perhaps 1 out of 3 times ( max ) does it sync successfully . The last time it synced up , it erased the settings/channels that were set-up w/ Avantgo . I AM SO DISAPPOINTED , because I had really high hopes and expectations . Sure , the chip is faster , but you know , it 's still croaking under the weight of the software . HP has really let a long-time customer down .	-1
Audigy Platinum sounds wonderful . Having the controls in the front is the obvious selling point , especially when you consider you get a free front 1394 port , BUT ... I leave mine on mute at all times unless I want to hear something specific . The reason is that every time you reboot the Volume DEFAULTS TO THE LOUDEST setting , waking everyone in the house . Creative has no fix , only a & quot ; work around & quot ; that does n't work . It is a pain to pay this much for a sound card and have to leave it off . Stick with what you have until they have a real fix .	-1
I ordered the Philips HS500 . I received the Philips SHS5200 , which is a MUCH cheaper headphone . I notified Amazon that I received the wrong item . They sent me a replacement which was another set of the SHS5200 . I called Amazon customer support and got a refund . Do n't order this item unless you want to pay twice as much as for a set of Philips SHS5200 .	-1
This camera was horrible . Picture quality was the only good thing about it.Batteries - I burned through 8 AA batteries in the first day ! Think about it . It 's like getting a laptop and having to plunk 4 D size batteries in it to use it . Any small mobile electronic item that does NOT come with a Lithium Ion battery should be avoided in my opinion.Lens cap - piece of garbageShape - VERY awkward in you handsAnd much much more ... I returned mine and bought another brandFor the same amount of money look to other brands , you 'll find that they offer all that this lacks at similar prices	-1
Bought these headphones in September . I 've used them off and on for biking and put them in when I 'm walking around campus . Tonight , I realized the rubber casing on the right earphone had worn off and the circular metal sound piece had become loose so it is detached from the rest of the headphone.Not durable enough for my active lifestyle .	-1
It did n't pick up the voice sound clear at all . Sounded like i was in left field trying too get a voice Level for recording my singing . For me , not good , but for someone else that justs needs it in a conferance room , maybe it will work fine . Thanks Again .	-1
I give this player one star because the anti-skipping does not work . I like to take long walks and listen to books or music . I bought this player so that I could put an entire book on one CD . Actually you can put a bunch . But when you try to listen to mp3s or regular CDS while walking , it skips alot . The only way that you can walk and listen is if you walk very , very , very slow and hold theplayer in the palm of your hand so that it is horizontal to the ground . I 've gone back to my 3 year old Philips Magnovox CD player with its 45 second anti-skip because it does work , although I have to use multiple CDS again for listening to a book .	-1
Have owned these for a year now . I would not recommend them . I have these at home for my PC . Everything seems to add interference . Its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones . Some days just turning your head a few inchs when I am a feet from the unit is enough for them to loose signal . I do n't bother to charge them on the stand , I rotate batteries between a charger and the headphones . At work I have had 2 pairs of sennheiser headphones . In 2004 I bought the RS-40 . They worked great but I broke them by standing on them . Now I have refurbished RS130s that work excellently , and they run in rechargable AAA 's ! Neither Senn 's really have the `` surround sound '' but I ca n't tell the difference to be honest . The surround sound on these is not that decernable . I think reception quality trumps surround dound in the end . I would get the RS130s	-1
While JVC seems to offer the only real choice right now in DVHS recording ( the Mitsubishi DVHS VCRs are not compatible with DTheater tapes ) , this is definitely on the & quot ; bleeding edge & quot ; .HDTV recording can only be performed from an incoming iLink ( FireWire/1394 ) connection . There is a single HDTV component output , but no HDTV component input.On the plus side , JVC includes DV- & gt ; MPEG2 transcoder circuitry , allowing you to connect a DV camcorder and record on MPEG2 ( although I 'm still not sure why you would n't leave it in its native , smaller tape DV ) .In my case , the JVC properly registered on my Mitsubishi HDTV ( with HomeLink ) , but NOT as a recordable device . So , no way to record - only playback.As a regular SVHS VCR , you can find much better for a fraction of the cost . Cable box control only goes up to channel 199 , so not much use in the digital cable markets . There is no ability to control input audio level.Unless you absolutely need DTheater playback , or you know this will work with your HDTV , then save your money and wait for the technology to solidify .	-1
after reading all the reviews , I decided to pull the trigger and went ahead with purchasing this lens.It was shipped two days later and I immediately performed several test to check sharpness , IQ , and BQ.What can i say , Sigma and their quality control has done it again.the lens was loud and not as sharp as i thought it would be . Soft unless you are shooting at around f5.6 and lower.that is all ...	-1
I wanted a macro lens that would also be good for portraits/snapshots and this just was n't it for me . I found , as others have said , that this lens has issues with the autofocus and the shots I took just were n't that sharp , even at f/2.0 and above . I love the Olympus Zuiko 50mm Macro , but the focal length was just too high for what I want to use it for , but boy was it sharp ! This lens is also VERY heavy , even heavier than the Zuiko 50mm macro . I would really love to see Olympus come out with a fast prime ( think the Canon 50mm f/1.8 ) , macro or not , for the E-Series cameras . I 'll stick with my 14-54 f/2.8 for now !	-1
This is the only Sony handheld ( at present- 01/02 ) that can connect to a cellular modem and it 's a shame . The screen is horrible . The color ones , such as the Clie 760 are great but there 's no wireless modems to go with them .	-1
I always used to love Sony products , but this walkman adapter is the worst product I ever had to use . My first one broke after a couple of months , and thought it was the daily wear and tear , so its perfectly understandable . So got another . 2ns one broke after a couple of months , and finally the 3 rd one within a year , self-destructed inside my player . Yes I know , you probably thinking it was my player , but I took it to the sound shop and they looked at it and found no problems . So hopefully this review reaches people , and shows are bad sony 's quality control has become . For myself , I have resorted to the speaker phone of my phone until I can purchase a new unit with AUX IN , from the money i save from not buying anymore adapters .	-1
I bought this because my car stereo is old enough that it only has a radio , a cassette player , and a single CD player . I wanted to listen to my *own* music , but I was getting tired of burning CDs and cassettes would be even worse , so I decided to try one of these which I 'd use with my iPhone or tablet . This adapter works fairly well except that in my car it clicks . Constantly . *click* *click* *click* over and over and over . It gets annoying . It 's loud too . I can turn up the volume enough to cover it up , but that can be *way* too loud - I have nothing against loud music , but I do like my hearing ... I 'm told that this is a pretty common problem with all adapters like this however - it 's the auto-reverse mechanism kicking in since because the `` tape '' does n't move , it thinks it 's stopped . I 've found a potential fix online and will have to try it , but until then , this thing is only worth 3 stars to me . At most.EDIT : could n't figure out a way to fix it.EDIT2 : after about 3 months of use despite the clicking , the cord snapped upon being pulled by accident , so it 's pretty weak . I 've decided to try another brand . Apparently from what I 've read , your mileage with one of these may vary . It 's pretty random .	-1
Here is the deal . The model is Sony CPA-9C , the & # 34 ; C & # 34 ; means made in China . These things are cheap , sound like crap and are from 1998 stock ! So , you are paying a premium for old , new stock . This wo n't last a month ... .	-1
The reception on a small TV in the kitchen with rabbit ears was rather poor so I bought this amplified antenna and mounted it near the ceiling behind plastic blinds pointing ( broadside ) toward the transmitters ~ 25 miles away . The reception was terrible ( next to non-existent ) . I 'm still using rabbit ears . A Winegard Sensar III GS-2200 in the attic of my ranch style house works great through a splitter to two other TVs .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS ANTENNA , I TRY ALL THREE MY HDTV AND FIND OUT I GET BETTER PICTURES WITHOUT THIS ANTENNA . BIG HEAVY JOK	-1
I 'm giving these speakers a 1 star only because there are so many 5 star ratings that is n't deserved . Otherwise I 'd give these speakers a 3 star.I purchased a set of these from Amazon for a surround sound based on the many recommendations . Because they come in pairs I stopped off at the local Fry 's store to buy a single center speaker to complete the set . Fry 's had all of the Polk series setup in their sound room so I compared them . After listening the RC60i , and then listening to the TC60i I have to say I regret buying the RC60i . The TC60i makes these speakers sound flat and the quality approaches that of a mid quality boom box while the TC60i sounds fantastic . The salesman told me that the RC60i are Polks entry level ceiling speaker.If you can afford the extra money and are installing into the ceiling , buy the TC60i . If you are mounting in the wall stay with the RC60i as they are not as deep.Another consideration too is that if you are putting these in the ceiling and have blown insulation you will want to handle that somehow . I wrote Polk audio and there solution was the insulation does n't matter but if I 'm really worried about it I could put a stocking around the speaker . I was surprised with that response . It does n't deal with the `` dead '' sound you get when the speaker has insulation all around it . If you clear the insulation away you defeat the purpose of having insulation in the attic . Other speaker manufacturers offer enclosures designed to fit their speaker with the correct volume and sound baffles , Polk audio does not . I also noticed that if I did n't `` box '' the speakers that the sound carried into the attic , out the house vents and into other rooms through the ductwork.You will definitely want to build an enclosure to house the speakers in the attic . I did that then buried the box in insulation.You also want to use a good twisted pair speaker wire instead of ordinary speaker wire . This eliminate the 60 hz hum that will be picked up from the 115 house wiring that is probably all over your attic . I used Monster Cable 16-Gauge In-Wall Speaker Cable UL-approved for in-wall use and THX-certified.Check your wire run lengths and if they are longer than the spec you may want to get 12 or 14 gauge wiring .	-1
Works ok , but anytime my AC kicks in , this thing makes my TV flicker . Very annoying . Did n't happen before with a normal surge protector . This was a waste of money . How many electronics actually get destroyed by a lightning strike ? I think I 'm probably more likely to get struck ... ... in my living room .	-1
Hooked up my cable and internet to the splitter , turned on the TV . Both went off , traced it back to the splitter which drastically degraded the signal to the point of both not being able to operate . The degradation was apparent on the cable TV without the internet plugged in . I realized maybe I went too cheap with this splitter , seems to be held together by glue in the back , most splitters also have the degradation numbers on the back but this has no markings but RCA on the front .	-1
These are NOT the tool-less twist-crimp connectors ! These are crimp on and do not work properly ( which is why Monster discontinued them in the first place ! ! ) After trying to crimp just two of them , they fell off the wire . And , of course , they ca n't be reused after you crimp them the first time . VERY disappointed . I should have known the price was too good to be true ( the twist-crimp version usually costs twice as much ) .	-1
RCA AH14100SN 100 Ft. 14-Gauge Speaker Wire Watch out.. It may not suit your needs . It is not copper wire so if you are installing it anywhere that will require bends it may end up breaking on you . The description does not say that it is aluminium wire.. In my case it was not even Copper Clad wire . Also it was not even 100 ft long ( more about 60 ft ) . Description of item is lacking or quality is going down on the product .	-1
If you have a $ 300 surround system , stop reading now because it wo n't make any difference what you use for speaker cable.By far the most important thing in speaker wire is conductivity . The current traveling in speaker wires is very low voltage , so you want minimal resistance . Consumer grade speaker wire is cheap , so cheap it makes no sense to save a few bucks buying a low quality product like this when you can get a much better wire for another $ 20-30 . Assuming you 're going to be using the wires you make for years , a few extra bucks for pure copper ( and preferably 14-gauge or larger ) wire is a sound investment , especially if you 're using long runs.But even with short runs speaker cables can make a difference . I learned that years ago comparing 16-gauge zip cord cables like this ( except all copper ) to some 11-gauge speaker cables . The difference was subtle , but undeniable . ( Tip : If you get 4-conductor 14-gauge and pair the conductors by twisting the ends of pairs at each end the result is equivalent to an 11-gauge cable . ) How much this wire will compromise your audio compared to 14-gauge copper and whether you 'll notice the difference varies a lot depending on your audio system , your room acoustics , your audio source , and how good you are at hearing subtle differences . Since aluminum is about 40 % less conductive than copper this is roughly equivalent to 18-gauge copper speaker wire . But if you care about the quality of the sound your system is producing , splurge a little and at least get pure copper wire . I guarantee all the other wiring in your audio system is made out of copper , and there 's a reason it is n't made out of aluminum.Here are some copper alternatives from a reliable source : Monoprice 100ft 16AWG Oxygen-Free Copper Speaker Wire CableandMonoprice 102791 14AWG High-Purity Oxygen-Free Copper Speaker Wire . If you 're planning to run cables in walls or ceilings , you 'll need cable rated for in-wall use : Monoprice 100ft 14AWG CL2 Rated 2-Conductor Loud Speaker Cable ( For In-Wall Installation ) .	-1
I decided to return this product for the following reasons1 ) I was doing an in wall installation so I wanted to use the properly rated wire2 ) It 's not as intuitive to remember which wire is which : both leads are transparent with one having a white stripe across . Is white the positive ? Is it the negative ? You 're guess is as good as mine , but I sure wo n't remember next time I look at it.3 ) It is CCA . I ca n't comment on whether or not this affect audio quality , but one thing I noticed is that CCA is more brittle and less malleable than pure copper.I decided to go with a different speaker wire that has insulation , has red and black leads ( call it `` for dummy '' but why risking blowing a speaker over damn colors ) , and is pure copper .	-1
I bought this product for my interface and it only actually works when i pull it out a little , i dont even use it i use another one , i basically wasted my money i feel , but its no big deal its cheap who cares i guess i got a dud	-1
I , too , have had a bad experience with my NP-FS11 . The first one died just over a year after I bought the camera ( DSC-P1 ) . I bought a second one and it died about 3 months afterward ! ! ! I do n't know if this is because of the camera or the battery . I have been thinking about getting my 3rd battery but lucky that I saw these reviews from Amazon.com . I may just hold off getting a new battery if this problem seems to be too common . After all it ai n't cheap ! ! !	-1
Read the reviews . There are too many bait and switch shipments in the reviews for me to have confidence in purchasing this item . I expect to pay more for a genuine Sony battery , but I wo n't take a chance on getting a fake.Shame on you , Amazon .	-1
This surge protector will work if all your plugs are of conventional size . I have an air conditioner and timer plug that are fairly large , and cover more than their own outlet . As a result , I am returning this product . A design flaw in my opinion , and not reflected accurately in the picture .	-1
It seemed so compact and useable and Iliked the idea of the volume control.I found it was too annoying and I did not hearwell with it . Not sure if it was just me , but findI am not using it and tend to use just regularsmall ear phones that fit well in my pocket .	-1
Mine broke within two weeks , the right headphone started to rotate a full 360 degrees when it should have been only 45 degrees . I thought crazy glue would help but they broke again , soon the week after same thing happened to the other one . Tried using crazy glue again for nothing , three weeks later the right headphone broke completely ( a thin piece of plastic that holds it to the metal rotating piece just broke ) . Needless to say these were trash , and perhaps too big for the design . Had they been smaller they would have survived . I yet have to send them to see if KOSS would honor their lifetime warranty . Very dissatisfied , I paid thrice what they sell here since I bought them downtown and was in a hurry to get headphones that day , very disappointed .	-1
I was excited to receive this item as I have lost two lens caps in the past . As soon as I took it out of the package I immediately attached it following the instructions to the letter . There is no problem with the sticky part staying put on the lens cap . The problem is with the little string that is attached to the elastic band . The second time I removed the lens cap from the camera , the little string disconnected from the elastic . So now I have a little string hanging from the lens cap that is n't attached to anything . This is a cheap piece of junk ! Do n't buy it !	-1
Product lasted 3 weeks . Very cheap build . Strap broke WAY too easily . Looking for a better product . I would not recommend that anyone purchase this .	-1
I bought this turntable to replace an old but excellent Connoisseur turntable I was using to transfer LPs to audio disc . The Connoisseur required a new belt at $ 60 so I thought I would buy the Sony.I immediately notice a major problem - significant rumble . Annoying , but I could deal with this by applying a low frequency cut-off filter.Many transcriptions had noticeable distortion on loud passages but I put this down to a problem with the LPs . Then I re-transcribed two LPs I had previously recorded with the Connoisseur . These recordings now had significant and highly annoying distortion in loud passages . It probably would n't be noticeable with pop music but with loud legato passages in classical music , e.g. , choruses or organ pieces , it is terrible . This is not overload as I was careful not to have line-in at too high a volume.Conclusion : this turntable has a cheap and nasty cartridge and/or pre-amplifier . I 'm junking the Sony and going back to the Connoisseur .	-1
I was hoping to improve reception on a few stations , so I decided to replace the twin lead dipole ( passive ) antenna that came with my new tuner with the Terk Tower . I have the AM Advantage loop and that works fairly well , so I figured this powered antenna would be a lot better.Well , bad reasoning . On FM , it does n't work NEARLY as well as a 32 '' piece of plain old wire on any of my radio recievers . In some cases , stations that could be tuned reasonably well with *nothing at all* attached to the FM inputs , and no internal antenna , could no longer be received with the Terk Tower attached.Those that could be tuned with the antenna attached had grotesque distortion . This despite turning the gain adjustment dial in either direction . It was functioning , as at low levels of gain , the station dropped off completely , and definitely changed as you moved it . So it was n't just broken . I could get barely acceptable reception on a few stations with micro-fine adjustments of the dial . But even at best all stations had all sorts of fuzz and dropouts . You could turn it up enough to swamp the receiver ACG circuit , but the distortion never goes away as you turn it down the point of losing lock completely.On AM , it does n't make it worse , but it does n't help , either . On all the weak stations I have tried , I simply ca n't tell the difference in the results . Once again , fiddling with the gain control changes it , but at maximum boost , it 's pretty much what I was getting with the the teeny little loop antenna that bolts to the back of the tuner . At lower gain settings you just ca n't hear the station at all.For all intents and purposes , it just does n't seem to work , I tried it on 4 different tuners/radios in 4 different places in my house , and in every case it made the FM reception MUCH worse than the stock antennas , and AM reception no better than the stock or internal antennas . I 'm probably going to break it open and try attaching different lengths of wire in place of the stock antenna , and see if that helps . But I get the impression that the booster amplifer just is n't up to the task of passing 107.7 MHz. , and introduces too much distortion at FM freqencies . It almost has to be - because a plain old wire that length is MUCH better.Even though it was pretty inexpensive , I was very disappointed with this antenna . You 'll get FAR better reception with a bent coat hanger . And that 's free with your dry cleaning . ( addendum - I finally broke my antenna open , and now it 's clear why it does n't work on AM any better than a stock antenna . It 's because inside the tower , for AM , is a small , unamplified , loop antenna ! It 's not even connected to the circuitry . Which begs the question of why turning the dial affects the AM performance . I speculate that the AM loop and the FM amplifier are interfering with each other - and that the AM is getting into the FM amp , causing modulation at the FM subcarrier frequency , hence , really fuzzy FM reception - and also dragging energy out of the AM loop more or less depending on the FM amp setting . BTW , the FM antenna is a piece of bare copper wire running the length of the antenna . Short answer is still the same - it 's junk , do n't waste your money )	-1
I saw no increase in signal strength or ability to get stations that I could n't pick up with just a peice of wire . Was very disappointed . Have gone back to my piece of wire ... at least that did n't have to be plugged in to a wall socket .	-1
This is a cheap trackball mouse and not as good as the Microsoft trackball mouse that costs much more . The small ball moves too easily , and it is hard to be accurate . Since it is cheap , I did n't bother returning it . I expected more from Logitech .	-1
Several of the internal connectors to the PCB were loose so channels were intermittent in copying between cassettes or from external sources . The PCB also needed more offset mounts to prevent bending .	-1
First off , I did love this mouse when I first received it , but it only lasted a couple months of light use . I was going to get the same one , but it now costs $ 100 ! So I replaced it with a smaller mouse of a different brand , which I actually like a whole lot better . This mouse is large and caused bad carpal tunnel , too , but I did n't know that was the problem until I bought the smaller mouse . I had this same mouse before , and it lasted over 2 years , so I am disappointed that this one was so wimpy.Oh yes , and I agree the light is too bright . It hurts the eyes when it 's darker , too , so I kept it covered with a cloth .	-1
I purchased a & quot ; 24 X & quot ; Lexar 256 MB CF card for my Minolta Dimage 7 expecting that it would store large images faster than the much cheaper 256 MB CF card I already had [ Delkin Devices eFilm ] . I was disappointed : the Lexar card was even slower than the Delkin card . 15 Meg images take 32-33 seconds to store with the bargin CF card . The Lexar card takes 5 or 6 seconds longer.At low resolutions , there 's no appreciable difference . I recommend buying the cheapest CF card that will work with your camera .	-1
Dayton BACT-GRB Banana Plug Pair Compression TypeSimply BLOW these away , and they are 1/4 the price ! ! ! Plus you can eveen mount the wire from the side ! ! ! The guy at BB tried to sell me on Monsterwire about a year ago , and after I chewed him a new one , every time I go in there , they KNOW not to even ask me if I want to buy some monster garbage . It 's a shame that the normal Joe , who is n't even worried about spending $ $ $ gets bamboozled into spending 3 times as much as they need to on cabling.My wife called me from best Buy and told me the salesmen was trying to sell her a $ 100 cable to go with the PS3 she was buying my nephew , I got him on the phone and he knew right away who I was , and was like `` Oh it 's you , well OK , I 'll sell her the AR one for $ 15 ''	-1
This bag is fairly well made . Here 's the problem - which has been detailed in numerous other reviews . IT IS A LITTLE TOO small.It fits the unit ( barely ) but forget any accessories , such as the USB cable , and no way will it hold the bean bag mount . The bean bag is the same size as this carrying bag , so it wo n't fit in it.Price a Kodak camera bag or a Samsonite camcorder bag - for about the same price you get a better bag , with more padding and some compartments , so you can carry your GPS and its accessories and a few other things ( a digital camera or your wallet or cell phone ) .	-1
Garmin deluxe carrying case is `` Big '' disappointment . Way too too small to accommodate anything other than the Garmin StreetPilot GPS Navigator . Save $ 25 and buy a `` small '' size Sears tool bag . Cost $ 2.99 and holds the StreetPilot , Dash Mount ( MANDATORY option ) cellphone , sunglasses , and wallet . Plus it reads Sears and not Garmin ( aka steal Me please ) . Bottom line is the Garmin Deluxe carrying bag is ok for the Nuvi , but not the StreetPilot and Dash Mount . Ironically , as poor as the Garmin carrying case is ... the opposite is true of the Garmin Dash Mount ; which cost about the same as the little bag . So , forget the bag and spend your money on the Garmin Dash Mount and a $ 2.99 Sears `` small '' tool bag . The good new is that you will love the Dash Mount for the Garmin StreetPilot 5 Stars , 5 Diamonds . Buy it ( Garmin Dash Mount ) through Amazon and enjoy .	-1

Not mentioned on the box , is the fact that this thing only has a 3 ft cable , useless for a desktop computer . It would be real nice if the manf would include this information . I 'm returning it to the store , and I WO N'T be looking at another Belkin .	-1
Just got this device today . I purchased it because my ZUNE does not have eq functions.I used to work in recording studios so my ears are trained ... I am not only familiar with what all different types of distortions sound like , but I also have a pretty good frequency spectrum recognition ( trained by hours of playing with warble sine wave test tones and various parametric equalizers . ) This is what I have to say about this unit ... : First of , the specification of this unit is 30hz - 20khz , but there is no tolerance indicated ( +-db , THD , etc ) so this number is pretty much garbage ... The center frequencies of the graphic EQ are 125hz for bass , 1Khz for mid , and 10Khz for treble , with all bands adjustable +- 10 db . There is no information on the Q and bandwidth of the curves applied . The bass and treble bands are likely shelved , but I have yet to play any sine wave test tones through this unit so I can not verify this.This unit emits a hiss noticeable at approximately 10khz - 16Khz , which is why I suspect the treble EQ is shelved ... This is not all bad or unacceptable for a unit this cheap ... However , I am not all that pleased with the choice of center frequency of the bass EQ . Most pop music sound much punchier with a boost of bass EQ centered around 50hz or so . I am not all that concerned with frequency below 40hz or so since all earphones by design can not do an adequate job with bone conduction hearing anyway ... Bass EQ centered at 150hz is way too high and makes modern pop recording sound bloated without the more satisfying lower notes . It makes a recording sound like those cheap boom boxes ... I suspect KOSS chose this bass band center frequency to cater this device to ALL cheap headphones on the market , as increase of the lower tones will greatly distort headphones that can not handle that kind of boost.So if your expectation is very low , and your device does not provide any EQ at all ( like the new ZUNE ) , then this unit will likely satisfy you . However , I do not think this device is of any use for devices that already have build in EQ functions . There are only 3 very coarse bands , the bass band center frequency is way off for any descent music listening , and there is small amount of noise ( which is the least of the problems ) ...	-1
This thing kinda stinks . It 's noisy , there is a hiss . I wanted to like it ... But it 's really not that good . I recently just threw it away ...	-1
Is your CAT5 a little too short ? Add another piece of CAT5 to it with this coupler . The price is right and you can buy a lot more of these than any retailer in town . When you need to join two pieces of CAT5 ( ethernet ) cable together this is a must . Everyone who uses CAT5 can probably use one . I have n't tried them out yet but I 'll edit my review if they turn out to be duds . The alternative is to use up more CAT5 and then have to buy another roll . I 'll take the coupler . EDIT : One out of two did NOT work . Buy something else .	-1
this lens takes forever to focus and i missed many wildlife shots in the field . the image quality is also not very sharp especially when i zoomed in . had to break down and spend 2k to get a sony 75-400mm lens and throw this one away .	-1
Pretty good price on this camera . You know why ? It 's so you can spend the money you saved on BATTERIES . I should know , we sell these at the store where I work . Probably 50 % of the S404 's we sell are returned because people ca n't use them for a normal period of time without the batteries going dead.I suggest you look at the Nikon 4300 or Canon S40/S45 . You 'll thank me later .	-1
Palm OS is great , I used to have a sony palm , great product . This one I ordered does n't have the same quality . If you tap on the screen , the accuracy is not there at all . My mistake is that I cut the UPC code too early and ca n't return this item any more .	-1
On the Nikon D60 , this lens has no AF if that is what you are looking for . I returned mine for the Nikon 55-200mm which also has the VR , and I 'm looking forward to using as soon as it arrives .	-1
The only reason I am giving this 1 start is becuase of Amazon 's poor service , otherwise I would give 5 stars for the product . I placed this order more than 30 days ago . Amazon still has not shipped the item so I cancelled my order and placed it with J & R . If Amazon did not have the item in stock , they should have stated on their web site or at least communicated with me that there will be a delay in Shipping .	-1
I bought a 310 camera a few years ago and it works fine and takes good pictures but , the batteries go dead after every use , which can get expensive if you do not have rechargable ones . Also , the software is not very good at all . It does have a lot of options though , such as stop action , motion detect and video . I eventually wound up buying a real camera that uses rechargable batteries .	-1
It was advertised as being a decent little print server for the money ... but I ca n't for the life of me get it working with a standard laserjet printer . Software is riddled with errors ( lots of error codes ) and when you can get it to find the print server , it ca n't ever find any attached printers . Let me add that the instructions mandate that the printer AND the print server need to be HARD WIRED via LAN to the router during install ... a point not advertised . Kind of hard when you have a large , heavy printer on one end of the house and a router on the opposite side of the house . Product itself is crap ... with more than ten years of networking experience , I ca n't figure it out ... but the company was great in standing by me and issuing a refund on the order . For that , I 'll definitely order from them again ... . just not THIS product .	-1
First let me say that this is an excellent film . My problem is with unknown storage conditions . This film has a two year shelf life and Fuji recommends refrigerated storate even for short term . The roll I received was fourteen months old and I have no idea of how or where it 's been stored . Also a problem with packaging . This was received in one of Amazon 's new packing methods which consists of a piece of folded cardboard . The film carton was crushed , but the film cannister apparently protected the roll itself . I tried this for the convenience , since no one in my part of town sells 35mm film , but I had to pass on this one and returned it . It 'll be a crosstown trip for me to a pro shop that has fresh stock and refrigerated storage .	-1
For all the accursed pains you 've had to endure using tape , you owe it to yourself to join the prison break . I wanted to collect episodes of 'First Person ' , which are only half an hour each . I put a bunch of them on tape then got this and thought I 'd died and gone to heaven . Each episode is a separate chapter , you can even pick the picture that shows in the index , when you go to queue up the recording , you can press the record button repeatedly for each 30m of recording . The unit will turn itself off automatically after that . If you do end up with extra time on the end of the recording , it 's easy to discard it.My only caveats about this are two : 1. the unit itself is slightly cheesoid , not what you 'd expect for a g. 2 . I bought some [ inexpensive ] DVD+RW discs and when I tried to divide a chapter it threw up a disc error . Straight recording on those discs has worked fine though and the quality is still great.Exciting Development : I changed the settings to not autoinsert chapters and now when I 'm done putting something on DVD that I got off of TiVo , I quickly scan through it and find the 4 or 5 spots where it returns from commercial and insert chapters so when I 'm rerunning it ( or sending a copy to a friend ) , you can just hit the next chapter button when a commercial comes up . Love this thing ! ! Well , no more . DISC ERRORs were coming up all the time , so I sent it in and got it fixed , then it worked again for a long time . Now , all the sudden , back to no worky . The biggest nightmare ever .	-1
i blew it in 2 weeks , but i guess that 's what i get for buying a cheap sub , lol spend the money and buy something else	-1
This card is fine for what it is , but it is basically useless for many high-speed applications . If you want USB 2.0 , it 's probably to feed a thumb disk or a hard drive or a video adaptor ... all of which will need the USB port to feed power.Which this card does not . Unless you plug in the `` optional '' power supply . Which is not available off the shelf in most stores . Sure , I was able to fashion one myself , but why should I have to ? This 95-cent omission on Adaptec 's side is a $ 15 problem on top of the purchase price .	-1
Set up the speakers but no sound from the right speaker . I then called Klipsch and they had me connect my earphones to the right speaker and sound came through both earphones ... the tech support individual indicated the amplifier is blown . He stated the speakers probably got banged around in shipping ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I 've had these speakers for a few years . They sound absolutely great ... excellent highs , plenty of bass , and TONS of volume . Unfortunately , a few months back I noticed that one of my speakers had started cutting out . I crawled under the desk today to check the connections , and when I tugged on one of the speaker wires , it came right out . I went to push the little spring-loaded lever on the connector and with very very little pressure it bent in half and then fell apart . Please note that there was never any strain on the connector . This thing has been sitting under my desk completely untouched for a couple of years , and has only ever been unhooked once since I bought the speakers.I would expect a little more durability out of components put into a set of computer speakers that I paid over a hundred-and-a-half for . From what I have found online , it seems there are a huge number of other folks out there having issues with connectors on these speakers .	-1
I rated this item with one star due to my liking of a well balanced speakers . This speaker is all boomy , and it muddled my jazz music . I ca n't hear the shaker , the sizzling cymbals as clear as before . The wireless also is iffy because it sometimes works and sometimes not . I have to move away my wireless landline to get a clearer sound . I tested this with Jazz , pop , rock , acoustics , classical ( London Philharmonic ) and some movies . This only sounds good on movies because of the boomy sounds but sometimes it drowns the voice of the actors . I thought of burning this in for straight 2 days and nahh I do n't have time.There is almost zero soundstage . My Creative 2.1 speakers 30 dollar speaker that I bought 5 years ago produces soundstage better than this.This would have gotten 2 stars if the speakers did n't produce a hissing and crackling sound whenever I try to plug it in . I guess I got a bad product.Again , it is up to you . What I recommend is get 2-3 speakers that you think you will like and return those that does n't meet your liking . What I did after a thorough research of under 200 dollar 2.1 is I bought Antec Soundscience Rockus and this Klipsc.Antec Soundscience blows me away . This needs to be burned-in for 40 hours but when it opens up it will bring tears to your eyes . : DIf you like a boomy speakers then get the Klipsch..	-1
It 's very simple , everything I have ever owned by SimpleTech has died on me including this drive , 4 USB sticks , 3 SD cards , and 1 CF card . Not one of their products lasted me more than 2 years and caused me a lot of headache .	-1
First I have to start off by saying that this CD player has the most features in any portable CD player I have ever seen . You have limited control over treble/bass , but the majority of portable CD players give you NO control over your sound , except for some stupid bass function . The remote is extremely useful . It displays all of your ID3 tag info on a nice 4-line display . One of my favorite parts is that the remote is backlit , which I find very useful for listening to the CD player at night . One of my other favorite features is that you can upgrade the filmware . I have only touched on the features that were important to me , because if I was to go though everything , we 'd be hear all day.So we have a great sounding , feature rich , and extremely slim CD player . Sounds like a good review so far , but I am convinced that Rio/iRiver ca n't make a sturdy CD player . I used to have a Rio SP250 that I loved . I dropped that and it broke . I take full responsibility for that . But my slim iRiver stopped working for no apparent reason . I have had the disc player for 11 months now , and it will not work unless I hit it real hard to get the laser to move . Reading a lot of other peoples complaints , it seems like this happens way to often . A portable CD player needs to take a little abuse here and there . It ca n't just stop working for no apparent reason . And fortunately for me , my service plan ran out 20 days ago , so I ca n't do much . I could go through the manufacture and try and get it fixed , but I ca n't be without a CD player for that long . I use this for 8 hours and work , my car , and home . I really find it hard to live without a MP3 CD player . So I went out and picked up a Sony Atari player . It 's the $ 100 version and thus far I am happy . Sounds good and the menu structure works well enough . I wish it was backlit and I could control treble/bass . But those are my only complaints so far . I would not recommend getting an iRiver disc player unless you get it form somewhere like a Best Buy where you can get an extended warranty . I say stay away , but it might be worth the chance .	-1
I 'm only commenting on the audio quality of the player , because after I discovered that the volume just was n't loud enough , I did n't bother investigating the other features . I received the SlimX yesterday and am returning it today . At the highest volume setting , it would be adequate if you were sitting still in a perfectly noiseless environment , and even then , the volume would certainly not be considered deafening , but that 's not the situation in which I would normally use it . The earbuds , as everyone else comments on , are pretty much worthless , but I tried the player with two other sets of headphones and still was n't satisfied . Even with a set of Koss over the ear headphones , I could still hear people around me talking with the volume turned up full.I 'm sure it 's a fine product ( I 've been buying from Amazon for years , and base most of my purchases on customer comments , as I did with the SlimX ) , and is definitely eye-catching with its techno good looks , but this is n't the MP3 player for me .	-1
I bought this as my first digital camera five months ago , largely on the strength of the Amazon reviews . I intended to use it for routine snapshots . I ca n't state how well it stacks up against other digital cameras , of which I know nothing . But I can say I was surprised by deficiencies it has , when compared against my $ 100 Olympus 35mm film camera.First , the indoor exposure quality is pretty poor . Its sensitivity reminds me of ASA 100 speed film . A flash is always required indoors . The flash is quite anemic : anything 8 feet or more away will be dark . In photographing a kids ' soccer team two rows deep , the front row was slightly overexposed while the rear was underexposed . The line was about 3 feet deep total . There is very little exposure latitude with the flash.Second , I have never seen such red eye in my life ! The flash is about 3/4 '' from the lens in the same horizontal plane . I have to spend a couple minutes in Photoshop to clean up every single shot . I 'm used to seeing eyes like this on flash photos of cats , not humans.Third , the battery is tiny , proprietary and very expensive . This probably explains the weak flash - there 's very little power and Nikon needs to preserve it . Plus , after about 30 seconds idle time , the camera hibernates to save the battery . One has to press the shutter and wait about 5 seconds for it to revive each time.Fourth , while outdoor exposure has been good , the LED screen is too weakly backlit to view at the beach or ski slope . And there 's no optical viewfinder , so you often ca n't see what you 're photographing in these circumstances.Fifth , one must swivel the lens assembly open in order to use the camera . When doing this , it 's very easy to put a fingerprint over the fixed transparent lens cover . And a little bit of smudge on that cover gives plenty of artifact on the pictures.Finally , while I shoot at the unit 's maximum resolution , it 's still not acceptable to press the shutter button and wait two seconds before it takes the shot - and then wait another 3 or 4 seconds for it to be ready for the next . And if the flash is involved , that adds another 2 seconds before the picture is taken . Like I said , I was looking for family snapshots ; but far too many pictures have the subject moved out of the frame because of these delays.So , this camera is okay for some things - especially outdoor daylight shots that are not too bright . But my 35mm performs a lot better in many circumstances . And its Costco-developed pictures are about 30 % the cost of those from a digital camera . And I do n't have to spend hours engineering Photoshop corrections , or burning the images to archival CD.If I had it to do over again , I 'd be more fussy about cycle time , battery capacity , flash distance from lens and exposure latitude . Live and learn .	-1
Though adequate as a replacement for an APS pocket point-and-shoot , this camera has several drawbacks that should give pause.The too-clever signature Coolpix `` twist '' to expose the lens takes just that much longer and is just that much more fiddly than simply removing a lens cap -- and one misses too many photos as a result . A sliding cover would have served much better , especially one that also turns the camera on . ( The twist does n't turn the camera on , that 's a distinct step . ) Controls , menus , and features are generally good , as is the LCD , but the power switch is easy to leave in the wrong state and is poorly constructed.Sadly , the real failing of this camera is its image quality . Maybe I 'm comparing apples to oranges , but when I bought this as an easier to carry substitute for my Olympus C-3040Z I was prepared to loose some quality for the sake of convenience . However I was not prepared for the glaring failings I encountered . First off , Nikon compresses its highest quality images more than is necessary . Far worse are the strange washed-out or saturated colors I get with this camera . In side by side comparisons between my two digital cameras , where the Olympus produces striking results , the Nikon 's are consistently over-saturated and blurry . I have taken both cameras on several trips , and find myself discarding almost every shot taken with the Nikon , even when I have no equivalent from my Olympus.Overall , a convenience not worth the disappointment .	-1
First off , this is n't that bad of a machine . However , it had some annoying features that caused me to return it . I would really rate this between 2 and 3 stars , but since you only get whole stars , I went 2 on it . But , that 2 is just because of what I found wrong with this machine as far as what I wanted from it.First off , the picture is not that bad . Also , playback is not noisy and the picture and sound is pretty good . Having audio inputs on the front is great . Also , the programmeable timer options are great.But , I had some problems with this machine . Two of them are not fixeable due to the design . The other might be due to a bad machine , but I 'm not sure . However , the first two points I cover are the reasons why I returned this unit and gave it a 2 star rating.Reason 1 why this machine went back - in order for the timer recording to work , you have to press a TIMER button on the remote . Hello ! This is NOT the 1980 's . Yes , that is what the OLD VCRs did , but in this day and age , you normally just program the time you want to record and then turn the VCR off . It would n't be so bad with the timer button IF it were on the machine as well , but you have to do it from the remote . If you lose the remote , you 're out of luck . This alone was the major deciding factor in why I returned this unit . Plus , since my wife is the primary user of this machine , she found that to be annoying . She does n't want to have to hunt for the & quot ; other & quot ; remote just to turn off the machine and put it back into timer mode . You see , I have it set up to record her Y & amp ; R on a daily basis . If we stayed with this machine and she just hit the power button on the remote ( as she has done for 10+ years on our previous VCR ) , the timer would never kick off and record the show for the next day . Oh boy . If THAT happened , I would NEVER hear the end of it ! ; ) Reason 2 - The remote ONLY works with JVC TVs . You CAN NOT program it to work with other TVs . On top of that , I could NOT for the life of me get this VCR to work with my universal remote that I already own . I use that remote for my TV , the cable box as well as the old VCR . Now , I normally probably would n't care too much about this , but since my wife is the main user of this VCR , she DOES care about it . She does n't like having to hunt for multiple remotes.Reason 3 - This did n't necessarily cause me to return it , but it is an annoyance and possibly , it was due to a faulty machine . But , reasons 1 and 2 had already made me decide to return it , but I wanted to let people know about this possible problem . The auto-tracking is VERY slow and some tapes that I have that I KNOW work fine in HiFi mode apparently could not be adjusted to stop noisy playback . The tracking seemed off and the HiFi sound was awful for some tapes . Playing them in another machine resulted in clear playback . Also , it seemed at the beginning of a recording , the picture was bad for about 10 seconds as if the tracking were off and then it finally fixed itself . This is kind of annoying if you ca n't see the beginning of your recording . Normally , when I program the timer , I give myself 5 minutes before and after the program 's time . However , there are times when something comes on that I want to see and I have to hit the record button right there . With this machine , I would possibly have to sit through 10+ seconds of snowy picture before it clears up . This seemed to happen time and time again as I tested the recording function . Again , this might be due to a faulty machine . I even ran a head cleaner through the machine and that did n't help.However , if annoyances 1 and 2 mean nothing to you , then this machine is not that bad of a buy . Some stated it ate tapes as soon as they got it home . Others have stated noisy playback from the machine itself . I experienced no such problems , but of course , I only had the machine for 1 night and exchanged it for a Panasonic , which DOES N'T require you to hit a timer button AND it 's remote could control my TV AND my universal remote can be programmed to control the Panasonic VCR.I guess the best bet is to try it out for yourself . I myself did n't like some of the & quot ; features & quot ; it had and returned it promptly .	-1
Sounded great but only lasted a year . I do n't BOOM my music but I like it loud . I guess I was playing it too loud . I guess this would be good for moderate to low music -- maybe it would last longer . I will not buy again .	-1
The good : I 've had an FS116 10/100 switch that I bought 3 years ago , and it worked well.The bad : The switch went bad , and I have been trying to contact Netgear because it is supposed to have a lifetime warranty . Call Netgear on the phone and you wait 20 minutes . It then sounds like they transfer your call , but what happens is you get disconnected . Tried this twice from two different phones , and the same problem . So I try to email them about the issue . You can not email them without creating an account . So I create an account , get an email from them with the account password , but the password does not work , I can not login . I try the Chat button on the Web Site and it does not work . So effectively , there is no way to contact these people if you have any issues . If a company can not provide so simple a function as allowing your customers to contact you , then they are not worth doing business with . I will no longer be buying anything from Netgear .	-1
tried this as a cheaper solution for the Netgear JGS516 . did not operate well at all . unit locked up multiple times . would not purchase again . Seller was perfect . product arrived as promised . Not sellers fault product is horrible .	-1
Works as described . I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable , making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive . It 's smart for Sony to conduct business this way , but only in order to earn profit in the short term . You can bet I wo n't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future , now knowing that this is how they run their business .	-1
I own one of these cameras and it has very low hours on it . The transport mechanism has failed and will not properly load and play tapes . Not only that , the tapes now appear to be damaged for playback on another machine . I have owned many Canon products and have been satisfied with them , but this unit at $ 600 should be avoided .	-1
I think the product i recieved is a refurbished product . not a brand new product . it is opened from inside and nicely package with plastic from outside . there are some scratches on the modem . I am not happy or satisfy with it . however i have no time to return the product and i will bare with this .	-1
I bought this keyboard to replace my old MS Natural which was 7 years old . I loved that keyboard . The keys had just the right feel , and the quality was excellent.Understanding that it would be impossible to buy another keyboard built with that quality , I went searching.I decided on the Microsoft Natural Elite because of the reviews I read here.Updated Review 8/22/2010.Since I have now owned the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite for 5 months , I think I have a better understanding of why some of the reviews for this product were negative.Since my purchase on March 31 , I have started coding Java , and doing a lot more writing.The spacebar has always been a problem . It sticks badly if it is hit on or near the edges.I am also having trouble with the shift keys . Like the spacebar , it sticks badly if you do n't hit it just right . This applies to both the shift keys , so it 's not a defect per-se , it 's a design flaw.I have had enough of this keyboard . I am going to look for a different one at a local retailer where I can try the keyboard before I buy it . Right now , I 'm thinking a Logitech . Anything but another Microsoft product ! After 5 months , I rate this keyboard unacceptable , unless you do n't use it much , or have a very heavy hand . Definitely not the keyboard for writers or coders .	-1
I was given one of these at work . WHile it does keep your wrists straight , the keys are EXTREMELY SOFT TOUCH . Words often blur togheter and I have to spend extra time correcting them bevcause of this soft touch -- - especially the most important one - the SPACE bar is so soft . I would never buy one on my own . Not sure I am going to keep it ; may just turn it back in .	-1
Unit is pretty much junk . I guess you get what you pay for . Unit often fails to detect large people within 6 feet of sensor . Many failures of receiver at 12 feet on other side of wood and stucco wall with windows . If you want reliable detection of intruders , this is not the unit . Save your time and money and find something better .	-1
Found that the receiver has to be literally adjacent to the sensor to work , rendering it useless for any kind of range detection .	-1
Never worked right out of the box , and it would only work up to about 50 ' , with numerous false alarms . My driveway is 400 ' long , so it wasnt worth taping/messing with the sensor since it wouldnt reach the distance i needed . i quit messing with it after the first day and will buy something more robust to replace it .	-1
Oh it works alright but it also has lots of false alarms . I 'm working with to try to locate it where it wo n't go off every five minutes . Ca n't determine if its clouds , shadows or wind that causes it to go off so often .	-1
I have tried everything to avoid false alarms , but it seems to me that this item needs to look across a perfectly barren expanse to work . I have a few 10-ish-foot-tall trees on both sides of my drive within about 30 feet of the pavement , and every time it 's windy at all , as well as occasionally when it 's not , the sensor activates falsely . The only thing moving in its view when it goes off is tree limbs 45 or so feet away . Narrowing the sensor 's field with tape to less than ten percent open resulted in no alarm when needed , while about 15 % open still gets lots of false alarms . I have tried many different positions and apertures with no better results . Upon thinking about it more , it seems obvious that a motion sensor is going to go off if anything nearby is moving , so any trees it its view would spoil its efficacy . I give it two stars because it does go off when somebody goes by it , but even a few false alarms every hour is too many . Does n't anybody make an electric-eye type of driveway sensor ? Why not ? My garage-door 's electric-eye stopper works great .	-1
Purchased for my business to alert me when I was in the back room and someone opened the door - worked great for the first couple of months-now the alarm will not turn off . Nothing is effecting the unit -motion , batteries light , tempeture , or sound but the alarm still will not shut off1 . Is indoors , so weather conditions do not apply2 . Placed on floor under a cabinet , so bright light does not apply,3 . Moved to dark location off the floor where there can be no movement-no luck4 . Changed batteries-did not fix the problem.5 . Hid sensor in a drawer-turned on receiver ( placed it in a drawer in a different room ) and the alarm has not stopped and is still going after 25 minutes ! Total waste of money !	-1
However , I never received the first radar detection , other than driving by someone 's house who had an alarm system . The patrol cars that I normally meet keep their radar turned on . On my old 5 year old Cobra , I always got a detection when I was anywhere in their vicinity . I got nothing on the Whistler . The one thing that I liked was the built in compass . It was pretty accurate . I have ordered another Cobra , and returned the Whistler .	-1
Why would they make a cord that is like 10ft long ? What are you supposed to do wind it up and put it in your pocket ? The construction of these are very cheap , just one piece plastic headband that hurts your head . The cord is VERY thin and will break easily if snagged . It has decent sound , similar to all the cheaper over the ear headphones on the market . Another problem I had with these , as I have with all over-the-ear headphones is that they make your ears sweat really bad ! I just ca n't wear them very long because of that . I have relegated these to my use when making some recordings because of the long cord , but I never wear them while listening to my iphone because of the long and very fragile cord . I know if I snagged them one time the cord would break .	-1
I bought it since the price temporarily dropped . After using it for one day , I decide to return it.1 . The build quality is ok , but it is 100 % plastic feeling.2 . sound quality is ok , clean but not deep nor expressive , but why do I buy a ~100USD heavy headphone just because it is ok ? 3 . It is way tooooo tight . It is not about the pain on the ears , it is about the pain right on the contact point on my head.I do n't have abnormal size head , the pain is instant on and it kills all the ( possible ) fun of listening to music.conclusion : if you love to pay ~100USD to get a device to press hard on your head , go for it.If you plan to buy a music listening device , then forget about it .	-1
The sound quality of portable cd players has been on the same downward spiral that most sound equipment takes when commoditized for the mass market . The reason for this is simple : Joe Duh Average wants FEATURES not SOUND QUALITY . If you read most of the reviews , most people are talking about features . One self-proclaimed & quot ; audiofile & quot ; ( sic ) says the & quot ; bass sounds good & quot ; , but mostly mentions features.Note that the manufacturers do n't even list real specifications anymore ( like Total Harmonic Distortion - THD , signal-to-noise ratio - S/N , output level , etc . ) because Joe Duh does n't understand or care what these things mean . Joe ca n't see the op-amp or compressor inside the machine -- but he can see whether it has a remote control or not . ( Why anyone needs a remote control on a portable cd player is beyond me . ) So when Joe goes to the store to select a portable cd player , he buys the one that has the most visible features . ( Joe wants to get his money 's worth , after all . ) So , what do you do if you are a manufacturer ? Where do you invest your money ? This is why most portable cd players have a muddy , unbalanced sound these days and this player is no exception . If you look at its specifications , it lists features . The frequency response range really does n't tell you much , and that is the most you can get out of them . But just listening to it is a real disappointment . It is fascinating to me that people are willing to pay extra for things like AVLS when this is redundant -- just use the volume control ! Check this out -- they try to pass it off as a feature : it & quot ; guards your hearing by capping your listening level & quot ; . Thanks , big brother . ( Sony does n't wan na get sued . ) Although they are n't going to tell you the output level , it is only about 5mW per channel . It is sturdy and does n't skip -- everyone is right about that . It is heavy and bulky if you want to carry it in your hand while jogging , however . If you are a true audiophile , I would recommend looking elsewhere . They are n't making good quality portable cd players anymore , and the one I finally found is the best I could get from what is available and it is n't even on the market anymore . I got lucky and found a distributor that happens to have a stock of them and when they are gone , my guess is that there will be no more to buy anywhere . That player does not have the mp3 , which is fine with me . It is the Panasonic sl-ct470 and they are going for about $ 50 ( original price on release was closer to $ 75 , I think ) . The sl-470j is the same player , but it has a remote control which does n't interest me . It has a S/N of 96 dB and 9mW per channel output level . It is light , not as sturdy as the Sony , but the sound quality is much clearer and the response curve is better . Of course , no one ever uses the earphones that come with any of these players -- I use either one of Sony 's MDR series or Sennheiser 's P100 's for exercising . The results with this particular configuration are pretty good .	-1
There is more to this product and you need to investigate it before buying . Purchased this and a Canon 50D adapter to shoot using a telescope . I could not get this product to work properly and called a good resource for advice . After an hour of technical discussion we determined it would not function with my system.so it sits in the purchased but does not work pile	-1
These pads are advertised to stop vibration to the telescope . They do not stop vibration at all ! Do n't waste your money .	-1
DO NOT BUY a Magnavox universal remote for your DVD Player.Buy a more reliable brand . Seriously , you will be sorry you bought this.In fact , eventually , you 'll feel like smashing this piece of **** into pieces.Try ordering the actual remote made for your DVD player from its manufacturerThey might work fine for a TV or VCR . But for a DVD player , the MENU FUNCTION is a shoddy , inoperable , unreliable waste of money.If you enjoy sitting there pressing the Menu function over & over forseveral minutes trying to set up your program , only to realize that theremote wo n't select some DVD set-ups , then , hey , buy it.I purchased an open-box Sony DVD Player at Best Buy , marked downbecause there was no remote . So I bought this Magnavox universal remote.It works fine for basic functions : STOP , PLAY , PAUSE , etc.But for choosing set-up functions or episodes on a DVD , it is horrendous.The Magnavox remote for most DVD 's , to choose a set-up ( widescreen or TV aspect size ) or to choose an episode of a TV show DVD , you must bypass the main menuscreen by pressing all the buttons to start playing the program . Then after it starts playing , you have to press the MENU button again until you get back to the main menu screen , then choose your set-up , chapter or episode , then press the play button until it plays again.The Magnavox Universal remote is especially frustrating for:1 . DVDs where you have to choose widescreen or regular aspect at the beginningof the disc . Most DVDs have the widescreen on one side , so those are not a problem.But there are some that require you to choose the aspect size on the DVD screen.You have to just play the default choice that it lands on ( usually the small 4:3 size . ) This remote simply CAN NOT CHOOSE the second option , no matter howmany times you play with it , the aspect menu comes on so fast when you put thedisc in , it does n't give the remote a chance to activate , so on the few DVDs thatrequire this choice , you may have to watch a movie in the small cropped TV size.2 . TV Show DVD 's : if you try to choose an episode other than the first one on the disc , when you first put the DVD in , it WO N'T LET YOU pick an episode . And you know howlong it takes to start watching a TV episode on DVD - you have to go through 2 or 3 menuscreens before starting the show ( episode index , episode description page , `` play episodeor recap '' page etc . ) With Magnavox remote you have to do all of that TWICE . Supposeyou put the DVD in , but you want to watch the third episode on the disc . Sorry . Ca n't Do It.You have to start playing the FIRST episode , then when it begins you have to press themenu button a few times again back to the episode list page , then choose ANOTHER episode , then go through the index , description , play episode , etc . all over again , then play it.A year after I bought this remote , the pharmacy had a rebate on a new Magnavox remotewith the flip handle design , It was free after the rebate , so I bought it . I have the same problemwith the newer remote , it ca n't grab certain menu functions to set up or play DVDs.I 'm not exaggerating . Magnavox Universal Remotes SUCK on DVD players .	-1
Received the wrong remote , however it works with my TV , it is n't worth the trouble sending back .	-1
Contrary to its claims , this remote does not retain settings when you change batteries . Not even for 5 seconds ! That means that you 'll will need to reprogram the whole thing every time when you change batteries . This is a ridiculous flaw . I would absolutely not have bought it if I had known this . The remote is simple and works , but a flaw like that makes it crippled . I do n't know how long the batteries are going to last , but if I end up re-programming the remote once every year or more frequent , I 'd probably be very upset about it . Because you will need the instructions every time when you program it , you better be careful keep the instructions handy all the time . What a hassle and a burden in one 's life this creates ! You would have to be taking care of that thing as if it were one of the most important matters in your life . But come on , it 's only a TV remote , not a car . At this moment , I am not even entirely sure where my new car 's instructions are ( hopefully in the car ) . I know this remote will end up being a piece of junk as I will lose the instructions sooner or later . Just the idea that I will be trying to find the instructions every once awhile , and trying to figure out how I did it the last time to program the remote , makes me sick . Do n't buy it unless your life quality is worth no more than a few bucks .	-1
After reading some of the negative comments here and on eopinions , I almost did n't buy this player . I should have listened to the critics , this cheap thing quit working after one week of light use.I took very good care of it , I only used it to play MP3 CD 's through my car stereo . It worked quite well at first , I was happy with it , but then it started skipping and pausing on my MP3 CD 's . So , I tried a BRAND NEW audio CD and it did the same , skip , play , skip , pause , skip , play , stop . So , I upgraded the firmware and it only made it worse , afterwards it would n't play anything . It just sits there , spinning the CD , never playing a note.This is the second lousy CD/MP3 combo player I 've bought , jeez , does anybody make a decent one of these ?	-1
This is my 2nd pair of these headphones , on my first pair the foam ear pieces wore out , and since these are Sony , their are no replacements for them . So I bought a brand new set of headphones and now these ear pieces have worn out . They lasted about a year each time . I 'm going to try the Jensen behind the ear headphones this time and see if the foam lasts longer .	-1
This thing wo n't improve your signal.I get the same number of channels with or without this amplifierand the signal strength stays the same.As you can see from the picture , you must run the same type of TV cablefor power supply which makes thing really bulky.Useless and worthless thing .	-1
Tried this unit on both my satellite and VHF/UFH roof antenna connections in all possible locations from house entrance point to right before the TV . It invariably would transform a 70 % signal into a 0 % signal . I thought the unit might be defective so replaced it for a new one . Same problem . This unit is less than useless for over the air ( OTA ) signals . The documentation that came with the unit is deceptive in claiming that it will work for OTA applications.Fortunately , Amazon has been very good about returns .	-1
My signal strength went from 86-88 to 87-89 . Not worth the electricity it uses . And what is up with the RG59 cables ? Anybody who is serious about signal quality will only use RG6 . It is being sent back for a refund .	-1
I purchased this camera in November 2002 . For almost 2 years it functioned perfectly , then about 6 weeks ago , I suddenly had a black screen . It is now in for repair for the black screen problem for the third time in 6 weeks . Fortunately , I purchased a 4 year extended warranty policy , and it has n't cost me for the attempted repairs . I did n't know the problem could be corrected by whacking the camera ! However , under the extended warranty no lemon policy , after this 3rd attempt to fix the problem , I will be able to get a full purchase price credit towards a new camera of my choice . ( Thanks Best Buy ) . I will stick with the Sony because I have the extra memory sticks , but I will definately buy the extended warranty again .	-1
Compared to the other walkmans what I bought in the past , it was half-way working . Even it was half-way working when I first bought it . It was half-way working because the headphone jack was all rusty and I had to push the headphone cord to make it work . When I listen to music , the sound gets all rusty or the left ear is giving no sound . Look , I 'm into walkmans like the S2 's but to be honest is you need to take care of this one . I 'll rate the reception as a 8 out of 10 on the FM because it gives slightly better reception than the other S2 walkman that I just bought during the summer . On AM , I 'll rate it as a 7 because the reception on AM is pretty decent but it gives a little fuzzy reception . The battery power is well-powered because I did n't change batteries for more than a month already thats cause I was not using that much and it does n't waste that much batteries . The volume I 'm a little dissastisfied because when the volume is too high it makes noise like the radio is static . So , do n't turn up the radio too loud . It does n't give too powerful bass like my other walkman . So , to be honest take care of this radio .	-1
But it does n't ! ! Looks well made , good install program and options to tweak it . Unfortunately , I tried everything I could , and it would never find my Linksys wireless G network ... I could control it from an ethernet cable , ping it , should work ! I already have a wireless G bridge that works quite well , but this one ... Looks like you have 50/50 odds for it to work , when yo uknow that the latest firmware release was in 2003 , it 's a shame for Linksys quality procedures ... Plus it 's still pricey for a wireless B , I 'm disappointed with Linksys ...	-1
I dislike this radio because it was malfunctioning when I purchased it . Was unable to set the preset stations . Return was swift and easy . That was the good part .	-1
This was a great DVD player when it worked . It lasted less than two years , and I am incredibly disappointed . I bought it primarily on the Sony name . One day , I went to put in a DVD and it made a horribled noise and refused to play a single DVD.This is actually the second Sony DVD player I have owned , and the other one met the same fate . I am not sure if it is just a bum player in a large lot of exceptional ones , or Sony does not make as good products anymore . This Player worked really good when it worked . It gave no warning , just crapped out . I also own a Panasonic DVD player that has outlasted both Sony 's , so I dont know that I would buy another Sony . Just be careful and make sure you have a warranty when you purchase one and Good Luck !	-1
This mouse looks cool and it performs well in every area but one : scrolling . The wheel-less button is very difficult to control with any precision and it requires a suprising amount of pressure to activate . If you do n't do a lot of scrolling then I 'd recommend this mouse , but if this is a feature you use repeatedly then I 'd give it a pass and wait for Kensington to come up with a better scrolling button .	-1
Not the aspect ratio of widescreen . It is not wide enough for your 15 & # 34 ; Elitebook .	-1
... I bought a privacy filter about 5+ years ago and while I needed some protection for a new external monitor , I figured it was time for an upgrade ( this `` new '' one should be better , right ? WRONG ! ) . When I got it , I literally compared it side-by-side and found it was NOT the privacy miracle some are TRYING to make it out to be ! : The viewing angle was NOT better ! BOTH glossy sides tend to ATTRACT fingerprints ! ( forget it if you have a touch-screen ! ) . I do n't like the 3M logo ETCHED into the corner of the filter ! And , the price ( and all the long , wordy HYPE ) is NOT commensurate with the `` improved '' privacy it alleges ! Bottom line , it does AS GOOD a job as other privacy filters , NOT better , AND it does n't have a matte-finish on one side ( like my `` old '' filter ) that prevents glare ! Save your money and buy another , CHEAPER product ! ! Anyone who says differently is n't being completely honest with you ! ! !	-1
did not like this at all . it was not able to fit . it was the wrong size and it was late .	-1
This privacy protector works so well not even the user can see what they are doing ! That 's a slight exaggeration but not by much , it is so dark even with the brightness of my laptop turned all the way up , it is really hard to see through it . Also , it throws off color quality enormously so if you need to see correct colors , this is n't for you.Another knock against this is that it 's not a film that & # 34 ; sticks & # 34 ; to your screen , you have to stick a bunch of small plastic tabs around the edge of your screen and slide the privacy filter down into the space created . If you are carryign your laptop while closed and it turns even slightly upside down , the filter slides out.I would give this at least 2 stars if not for the price .	-1
Yes it holds my CF cards ok . But batteries ? Maybe AA or AAA , but not digicam batteries . My Canon BP511 's wo n't fit - period . I doubt my girlfriend 's Nikon batteries will fit , either . So , I have a huge CF case . I guess it 's ok - hard to misplace and the size does cause me to remember to bring it . That said , if I 'm using my holster bag , it wo n't fit inside.Ah , the search continues .	-1
as far as I can tell this cable is not a belkin branded cable and it caused a buzzing sound in my speakers .	-1
unraveled in 50 days - do n't waste your money - it cheaply made.I got what I paid for . Alot of crap	-1
When I 'm using this splitter , the audio only comes out of one side . Going to see if i can have it replaced for free .	-1
Purchased from Elite , Inc . The item was generic ( no BELKIN branding or packaging ) and not what was expected . The signal was split so that the left channel came through one set of headphones and the right channel came through the other set of headphones . Inserting at different depths only resulted in slightly louder or softer signal . Each set of headphones should play both channels of the original signal unchanged ( if only lower in volume ) . It also had very tight-fitting connections . UPDATE : Elite Inc 's response was that I would have to return the item at my expense . Also , I noticed that the name on the packaging and the return address was Sapfire , not Elite Inc. That seems odd to me . I will be contacting Amazon about a refund .	-1
It 's good for the price , but sometimes the ports do n't work very well . Sound comes out good on both headsets , but occasionally have to re-plug as the sound washes in and out	-1
Why was this a recommendation for my Audiovox Acoustic Research AW825 Mission Style Wireless Outdoor Speaker ... when it does n't have any place to plug it it ! Im disappointed that AMAZON recommended it as an add on	-1
This item did not work right from the stzrt . I ended up buying another one from Radio Shack instead , and no problems ( fromt that one ) .	-1
I did not much care for this product . It seemed much too short for 12 feet . I guess if you stretch it full out it might measure the 12 ft . So I gave it away .	-1
I suppose that this would be an OK piece of gear if you do n't have a Viewsonic monitor , but if you do stay away from it . It does not work with the DVI connectors on the Viewsonic flat panel monitors . Instead you need to order the DVI II extractor from Dr. Bott . This is a major hit since Viewsonic is one of the larger and more popular monitor brands available .	-1
Unlike many other bad reviews , mine say `` cables to go '' on them so I think they 're legit . However the connectors rarely make a good connection . They 're too loose ... they just float around in the ports on my Netgear GS108 switch . Often I have no connectivity , sometimes I have 100 Mbps if I wiggle them just right , but rarely 1000 Mbps . Other cables work just fine . These are horrible .	-1
I thought it would be a good idea to buy a cable this short to reduce the cable clutter behind my desk . Unfortunately , I was wrong . These are just too short to be usable .	-1
I purchased a Cables to Go cable . At least that was the description on Amazon . I have multiple cables from Cables to Go ; so I know what they look like , and I know what their packaging looks like . Hohertz Technologies LLC was the party who supplied the cable , and neither the cable nor the packaging they sent me was from Cables to Go . Amazon needs to start policing and punishing these sellers who substitute generic junk for genuine products . I will never purchase anything from Hohertz Technologies LLC again .	-1
I was replacing a my old Radio Shack USB to Serial because I ca n't get them to work on Windows 7 . I admit I did n't examine the picture in detail before ordering because in 30 years I ca n't remember having issues with serial cables . Two serious flaws before I even plug it it.1 ) It has a normal DB9 end but it has these two big nuts which are unremovable . Most serial ports are going to expect the cable to have male threads because these female nuts are on the device itself . I ripped them off but that takes off the whole end of the DB9 which basically leaves a bunch of bare pins sticking with no way to secure the cable to the device.2 ) This one is obvious . This thing is SHORT . The cable is like maybe 24 '' which means its very likely you will need a USB extension to use it . I had to dust one off my old USB extension that had n't been used in years.The good news is that when I finally got it connected Windows 7 actually recognized it . Problem is that I now have hacked it so much its not really a good long term solution.Going to consider this a mistake and look for alternatives .	-1
I bought this to update my Escort Passport radar detector . The description says that it is a data cable , but the Escort program can only read info from the device -- it can not send data to it .	-1
The case is to flimsy to protect the DVDs or CDs . Hard to shut . Items tend to fall out . I can buy the same thing at the Dollar Store . They do not work either !	-1
I recently ordered two of these cables . One of the cables worked well on a 19 '' LCD display . However , the other cable did not work on my 20 '' LCD display ( 1600 x 1200 ) . On that LCD , the cable caused color and resolution problems that made the display unusable . When I substituted another brand of cable ( RiteAV VGA Cable with 3.5mm Audio - 15 Ft. ) , the display errors were solved .	-1
Plus , you might as well get the cheaper standard VGA cable . I did n't see anything special about this one that deserves a higher price .	-1
I 've been working with monitors and cables for almost 30 years . This , without a doubt , is the worst one ever . Really strong ghosting , any screen object had three or four echoes beside it . Text was unreadable . The cheezy little cable that came with my monitor works better than this.Just as an aside , the cable looks completely different from the one in the photo . Perhaps the good reviews here were for another model .	-1
This is the worst cable I have seen in many years . Even at 1024 x 768 the ghosting is hard to live with . At 1920 x 1080 the ghosting is intolerable , except for brief intervals .	-1
I also originally bought this cable based on the good reviews.For me the quality of the picture was not the issue initially , but how long the cable works correctly.The first few months the cable worked fine and I was able to use my LCD TV as another monitor for my laptop.However over time something had gotten loose and now the picture is green . So I am guesing one of the color cables.Mind you I am not hard on the cable and I actually never moved it after it was hooked up.So you get what you pay for I suppose.Decent but probably will not last you very long .	-1
Heavy cable that I use to hook up my laptop to a HDTV . No interferance with other electronics , picture was clear for 6 months . Then picture turned yellow . That 's right , picture had a yellow tint that would not go away . Replaced this VGA wire and picture is perfect . There is no external damage to the wire , so sometime inside the loom must have come apart . The heaviness of the wire disguises the poor quality .	-1
Suppose to be prolific chipset but the drivers would not install properly , tried in 3 laptops and they alll showed exclamation mark by the device when you looked at it in device manager ! Downloaded new drivers from prolific and same thing ! It 's not woirth sending back because even if Iget my money back , the cost of shipping is more ! the seller is a rip off and the product does n't work !	-1
Purchased to update firmware on my Harman Kardon AVR254 and AVR354 . This was recommended cable by HK so I purchased it . After down loading the drivers from StarTech cable and beginning update process on the receiver I received upload failed message . Tried multiple times using 3 different laptops . Two running XP and one Win7 . Finally contacted customer support . After 40 minutes in chat session the support analyst stopped responding to any of my chat notes . Finally got frustrated and closed chat . Cable does not work and service is terrible , will not purchase StarTech cables in future .	-1
When I purchased this , I was planning to use a VGA monitor with a rather new PC that does n't have a VGA port . It 's something I did n't realize , but the newer computer uses DVI-D as opposed to DVI , and there is a difference . Be sure to check before purchasing this . It should also be noted that this wo n't be used how one would expect . Because VGA uses analog signals and DVI uses digital signals , simply plugging a VGA monitor into this wo n't make it work with a newer computer if the newer computer does n't support the old VGA analog signals .	-1
i did not expect much , and I guess that 's good , but I GOT NOTHING as far as video pass through on this . It make sense cuz one signal is digial and the other not - but why sell something that does n't work ? ? ? ? too cheap to even bother returning ... maybe that 's the marketing slant on this .	-1
I bought these to use with my Dymo label printer . The labels print fine , but the adhesive on these labels is terrible . It adheres only for a short time and then starts peeling away . I do n't know about other Dymo Letratag labels , but these are useless .	-1
Seriously ... 5 of the 25 were ok to use ... threw 20 of them away . Almost every single one of these were busted ... very flimsy and totally unusable . It was like I threw money out the window . NOT PLEASED how I was misled by these favorable reviews for this product .	-1
Can not make it work with Windows XP . Tried several documents on the IOGEAR website on how to make it work , but it simply fails when attempting to use it with simple serial devices .	-1
I am replenishing a bundle of Memorex CD & DVD Sleeves that I bought a few years back . The sku is the same ... 0 34707 01961 4 but the Country of origin has changed as well as the quality . The original box of `` Memorex CD & DVD Sleeves '' was manufactured in Taiwan . The original Memorex sleeves are slightly larger as another reviewer has noted , but more importantly , in my opinion , they are a heavier duty stock as well as a `` bright white '' in color vs. a grey/white in color and flimsy sleeve on the current product that is manufactured in China . I am very disappointed in the current product and will be looking for a new manufacture .	-1
I use these cases for PC back-ups . I do a lot of wedding photography and back-up my RAW format sessions on BD-R 's . Needless to say they do not work very well for this purpose . The major problem is that they do not hold discs well . Something as small as setting the case down on hard surface can dislodge the disc so it falls out when opened . Never had this problem with slim cases until I bought these .	-1
I got a surprise when I open the box and found the Slim CD/DVD Jewel Cases I ordered were completely damaged at the bottom of the box . The package itself was undamaged . It looked as though , they were already damaged before they were placed in the box . Since they were Christmas presents , I had to go out and buy some new ones .	-1
Breaks and cracks easily . Too thin for protection of DVD . Flimsy and poorly made for shipping through the mail , ( they will get cracked in shipping ) . Hard to open .	-1
I have some old Memorex slim cases , and I ca n't believe how bad these are by comparison . The cover does n't lock closed , the cd does n't stay locked in and 2 of the first 6 were broken . They weight half as much and are barely half as good . I would never buy these again .	-1
Not worth the price ! I had both , the 520 first , which had some features I was not happy with but I thought the 550 with the 3 MP was the way to improve on it . Definitely not . At night , it looked like there were UFO 's behind me . Even when standing perfectly still , lights came out as streaks in the background . Printed pictures were not great and most photos taken were blurry.In the end I got the Sony CyberSHots 71	-1
None of the 'plugs ' fit . This was a waste of money . now I do n't know what I should do with it .	-1
Very disappointed . As others have noted , this is NOT a 5.1 system , as normally meant by `` 5.1 system '' - which is 6 discrete ( separate ) channels . Instead it 's just stereo , or 2.0 . Sure it has 6 speakers , including a sub , but it does not take 5.1 input , but only stereo input , so your 5.1 sound card is not put to good use . It 's simulated surround ( derived from stereo signal ) sent to rear speakers . Also hisses when off .	-1
Do n't waste your money , the product is still in its infancy . It is made of cheap plastic , batteries ( which it consumes faster than cheese ) are hard to replace.The response of the mouse is poor and lags as you move it around . It does n't know how to accelerate properly . And if the signal goes out of sync with the base unit you can expect frustration getting them to talk to each other . Stick to a wired optical mouse .	-1
Package arrived broken . Cables are not headphone size - these are large audio jacks . Returned them , will purchase smaller size elsewhere .	-1
The title say it all really . Just that simple . The cable feels nice and durable except for one small problem . Red channel works and white is utterly dead . No signal . Buy at your own risk .	-1
I 've bought 2 of these and had issues with both . After cutting off the 3.5 mm stereo plug from one and replacing it , it now works well . Seems rather fragile .	-1
The Male end fits loosely into some inputs while barely fitting tight in others . When it works ... it works . However , getting it to do so is sometimes difficult as it takes some jiggling around.I 'd say find another one ...	-1
Description needs to state the size of the adapter . Not sure if the product itself is useful because I ca n't use it . This is the LARGE headphone size . This will not plugin to your phone or Ipod .	-1
I bought two and one was very loose when a 3.5 male plug is plugged into this adapter and caused noise and a short in the line . It was so loose that it was not usable . Maybe I just got a bad one ? But I threw them both away and went to Radioshack and bought their equivalent . I 'm a little iffy on adapters , since a lot of them fail and Radioshack brand is usually of very good quality so I might just run there when I 'm in need of adapters in audio video cabling .	-1
I wish I had positive feedback for this.. but no do not buy it.. I did n't think they were any different so I got this one.. the sound quality when using this adapter is baaad . end of discussion	-1
I have had these adapters for a few weeks now and I ca n't say much good from them . The 3.5 mm headphone plug will not remain in place . Simply holding the jack upside down will result in the plug falling out . FYI this issue occurred within the first few days of use with BOTH adapors ! Sound is decent , but the connection is so flimsy that one ca n't even move while listening to music.I guess you get what you pay for ... ..	-1
For $ 2.99 , it will cost me more of my time and money to send it back than its worth.The coupler itself is heavy , metal , ridged , and looks totally badass . This is it 's only good part , and the exact reason why I thought I 'd get one.However it 's performance and appearance are WORLDS apart . 1st off , the connection is n't that great . This is not the deal-breaker though . What made me most unhappy was that the description stated Stereo , and its clearly Mono . I even tested multiple cords , headsets , and etc ... but nope , it 's clearly Mono.Whats worse its not even good Mono , the sound quality takes a dive too . Tested the sound quality using FLAC and MP3 versions of the same files . This specific coupler degrades the quality far worse than anything else I 've tried in the past.Do not buy unless you want to take the chance that my unit just so happened to be a special case	-1
** UPDATE ** 10 Nov 2013This stopped working for me . I threw it away . There is a much more expensive version of this item that I purchased at about the same time which works perfectly -- with all my headphones . Sometimes , you get what you pay for . ** Original review **I bought this to relieve the strain created on the headphone connector on my laptop . It works for a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-M40FS Professional Studio Monitor Precision Headphones , but DOES NOT FIT my father 's Audio-Technica ATH-M50S Professional Studio Monitor Headphone.On my father 's set ( ATHM50s ) the plug does not go fully into the female end of the Hosa adaptor -- results in only one channel coming through . The $ 2 Radio Shack adaptor does work so I 'm inclined to believe that the Hosa adaptor is out of spec.Anyone have similar experiences ?	-1
This is nothing more than vinyl hose that might be used on newer washing machines , split down the middle . Buy yourself some hose at Lowe 's , along with five zip ties , and ( Oila ! ) save some money.It is painful on the hands to insert the cables into the contraption , and once you bind it all together , it 's not much more compact than at the start . I would have done beter using zip ties alone .	-1
It is nice to have 20 GB of music and 22 hours of battery life ( with an optional 2nd battery ) . But I could n't get the jukebox to work with MusicMatch Jukebox and therefore was forced to used Creative 's extremely painful software . More painful was losing the AC adaptor . It is a 5V adaptor with a non-standard connector . So you ca n't go into Radio Shack and get a replacement .	-1
Got this the other day because of all the hype i read online about how great and loud it was . Your better off with a logitech , or anything but this . Not magnetically sheilded so you can not put it next to a TV without it feeding back . Bass is horrible , and distorted . Not very impressed at all . Would not recommend to anyone . spend another 10 dollars and get something better .	-1
Full disclosure ... .I have n't purchased this product , but did buy a different screen cleaner . Because of my experience and others who 've had the same problems with this cleaner , I thought I should share what I 've learned.The cleaner I purchased left a film & streaks on my TV and it did n't remove the fingerprints on the piano black bezel . I then found this information on Samsung 's website , under the Q & A ; section for my TV , model LN46B630 with a matte screen : `` Although there are a number of cleaning products on the market that say they are `` Safe '' for LCD/Plasma panel usage , I recommend just using plain old purified water without any minerals and a non-abrasive cloth . Purified water with out minerals will also prevent any mineral deposits to collect on the screen . -MrSamsung '' .I 've now cleaned my TV ( matte screen ) & laptops ( glossy screen ) with purified water w/o minerals , which is just distilled water and is under $ 1.00 for a gallon . I sprayed the water on the microfiber cloth that came with the kit I purchased , not directly onto the TV . It removed the film & streaks left by the cleaner I bought , without having to endlessly 'polish ' and worry that I 'm damaging the screen , and cleaned the finger prints from the piano black bezel , which my 'cleaner ' failed to do ... save your money and get the best cleaner : distilled water ! ! ! !	-1
BEWARE ! This product does not work with Mac OS X 10.2 or later . The software included with the product will launch okay , but it will NOT recognize any Olympus Digital Voice Recorder that you plug into your Macintosh . Even if you get the updated software off of Olympus ' website , it STILL does not work . [ ... ] Basically , if you want to get your digital voice files onto your Mac , you 're out of luck with this product . Shame on Olympus for not fully supporting the Mac community . ( Plus , the audio quality on this device is n't that stellar either -- I got better quality out of a 10-year old cassette tape recorder . )	-1
Pros : Plays music in a standard format on standard discs ( no MTP or other proprietary systems to deal with . ) Cheap.Cons : TOO cheap . Old and outdated . Limited format support ( no WMA for example . ) Oh wow ! These things are still being sold ? I bought one years ago when it was a brand new thing . Back then it was good because flash-based MP3 players used the MTP-style proprietary method of transfering files so they were a pain to work with ( not to mention that back then 256MB of flash was `` high end '' and extremely expensive . ) Today you can do a lot better and frankly I recommend against buying this . I 'll write from memory what I remember ( I gave it away a long time ago . ) First , it does n't remember any settings . I ca n't remember where it left off , and it does n't remember settings like shuffle . That means that every time you start it , unless you go through the 5 or so button presses it required to enable the correct shuffle mode , it would play your music in the same order.To make things worse , the displays do seem to be made more cheaply or something . I too had one where the display simply stopped working after about a month or so . While with most MP3 players a broken display is hardly fatal ( you need to hear a lot more than you need to see ) the fact that it could n't remember any settings or where you left off and that it required you to go through several button presses to enable basic options such as shuffle made it become all but completely unusable since I was n't aware I needed to memorize the exact key presses to do such things . If you want to play something in order this is fine , but , unless you rotate your discs very often , going in order will get old very fast.Also , I recently tried to help the person transfer an audiobook to the player . In an effort to make the files fit on a single disc , I elected to decrease quality somewhat . I used low bitrates , mono , and 22KHz audio . All I got out was silence though . Officially it supports sample rates from 8KHz to 48KHz , so I guess it just wo n't allow mono.Finally , if I remember correctly , I would occasionally actually get skipping despite the skip protection . If I recall correctly , it was certain VBR files it would skip on . I think I had the impression that it was primarily caused by files that could hit numbers like 320Kbps bitrate and the maximum the player was perhaps made for was 256Kbps . I may be mistaken about that , but , unmistakably whatever the cause was , it had troubles with some VBR . Either way , my current modern MP3 player has no such troubles.So , I give it two stars . It is functional , and will still work today -- and it 's actually small enough to fit within a large pocket , so even still has some convenience factor compared to a full-sized mp3 cd player . Unfortunately , it lacks a lot of modern features and the main advantages -- the large amount of storage for such a small size at its price range -- no longer apply today with flash based players hitting 4+GB of storage and micro/mini harddrive players in the area of 4-80GB and costing less for the same amount of storage .	-1
I really wanted to like this router . It 's packed with features , looks cool and was cheap ( after rebates ) . The setup was painless and I was working fine after only a few minutes . All was great until the wireless connection started dropping at regular intervals.I work about 15 feet from the router ( 2 walls ) and maintain a 95-100 % signal . At least once an hour or so , the signal quickly falls to zero for a few seconds , then returns to normal . Unfortunately , I use a VPN link to my office and a signal drop of even a second kills my link . I then have to close my applications and log back on to the office . That 's VERY annoying . I could accept some interference causing a drop once in a while , but at least once per hour , or more , is unacceptable.Too bad , I liked this router otherwise but I sent it back and will try Netgear .	-1
... , and I am giving the manufacturer [ time ] to produce firmware that solves my problems . Otherwise , I return it . Why ? An 802.11b ( WI-FI ) compliant device must be able to work with other compliant devices , regardless of brand . This one does n't in my experience . A router should not reset itself randomly.For one , I have already upgraded the firmware twice ( 1.1 to 2.0f , 2.0f to 2.03 ) , and it is still flaky . Two , I have been unable to get a Cisco Aironet 340 PCMCIA Card to Associate ( one that works on other networks ) . Three , a Compaq WL100 PCMCIA Card will Associate , but , it has obtained an IP address only once in over 100 Associations ! Four , the router appears to reset itself , irregardless of configuration ; this means that even my wired PC connections lose access to the WAN . This latter has nothing to do with my ability to configure the unit . ...	-1
Although this router had a lot of nice configuration features , I was disappointed to find that it fails miserably when it comes to performing some of the more basic ( essential ) router tasks.The DI-614+ requires a reset every couple of days because it flakes out and drop routing functionality through the WAN for all of my computers inside my local network with statically assigned IPs ( you must assign static IPs to your machines if you want to use some of the more advanced features of the router ) This is a HORRIBLE flaw that makes the router useless for any serious use.Another big problem is that it has a *VERY* weak routing implementation - if you keep TCP/IP connections open for more than 2 minutes without constant activity , kiss your connection goodbye . ( i.e . do n't expect to be able to use telnet , ssh , or ftp programs without your connection being dropped every time you leave your connection idle for more than 2 minutes ) This problem did n't happen with my old linksys router.I emailed tech support on this one over 5 times - they just kept sending me back a cut-and-paste of the entire user manual - they 're completely useless.Bottom line is - DO N'T BUY THIS ROUTER . Get a different brand router , or a string and two paper cups , because communicating across the web with this router is so unreliable - it 's worthless .	-1
I bought this router and is dropping VPN connection , this is very annoying . When I called D'Link , the support calls goes to some third party ( not direct D-Link ) I have to hold for more than 2 hrs to get coonected . The support guys does not have more than the config-guide knowledge . They refered the call to D-link special tech support . Never heard back from them . Returned the router to store . No option !	-1
My monitor have some extra usb connections and it uses a male A to male B cable for it , since I moved the monitor far away from the case , I figured this cable will do the trick better than it will to get a usb extension . Well , it did n't work , every time I connect a usb device to my monitor it detects that something is being plugged but never recognizes the device . I ended up getting that usb extension and it works perfectly , now I 'm wishing I did n't waste my money .	-1
The cable looks good , but did not work . The cable got EXTREMELY hot , and did not even recognize my devices . I switched the cable with another brand , and everything worked.Be careful when using .	-1
After reading all of the reviews , I had high expectations for this camera.While the menus are very complicated , and seemingly needlessly so , they can be mastered . But the camera does n't seem to be able to easily retain settings , despite following the manual as closely as possible . Battery life is quite short , despite not using the LCD screen or flash , and I could n't find anyone that has additional batteries in stock.Other issues involved the camera 's failure to connect to my computer [ an iMac ] , although Nikon help desk could n't figure out why . ... .My previous digicam , a Canon A20 , has performed flawlessly , and in fact took pictures as good -- if not often better at the same outdoor event as this Nikon . I am not a high-end professional , nor do I think you should have to be one to produce superior results with this camera . I bought it specifically to be able to control the exposure more , i.e . shutter speed , along with a reduced `` shutter lag . `` So far , I 'm disappointed on all counts , even allowing for my lack of sophistication when it comes to high-end digital photography . The LCD screen is almost unconscionably small , which is housed in a much larger flip-out panel that could easily accomodate a larger one . To me this is an indication of the haphazard approach Nikon has made with this particular camera , having had no other experience with Nikon previously . I strongly recommend you try this out in person , and then make sure everything works before any time elapses .	-1
I 've owned this camera since it first came out in 2003 , and since I 'm not a qualified camera `` expert '' , I want to give you my thoughts on this camera . I 'm giving this review as someone who is relatively new to digital `` point-and-shoot '' photography ... First and foremost , study the Nikon manual . Then study it some more . The controls are overwhelming at times , provided you are a neo-phyte like myself.Second , for exterior photography on the normal setting , this camera can not be beat ! It is exceptional . The images are clear , clean , and colors are spectacular . I 've photographed NASCAR at the California Speedway , and other events like the Coronado Speed Festival , etc. , and the outdoor shots look great . Now for the indoor-shooting ... This is where the camera gets its two star rating from me . I do not know how to select the manual control on-the-fly . I 've tried to set up controls to shoot indoor photography , but I do n't have weeks and weeks to learn the settings . I 've photographed people who are standing completely still , slightly moving ( my kids ) , low lighting conditions , fair lighting conditions , and still can not get proper images to come out.The indoor photography is pitiful , as the colors are yellowish , muted , and nearly 90 % of the time , the images are all blurred . The pop-up light is only good for 5-8 feet at best . I took some special shots of people who were stationary , and it appeared that the photo looked `` good '' when zooming in and out with the control . When I downloaded the CF card to my PC , the images were always blurred and the colors were way off.Mind you , I 'm not a camera professional like many of the reviewers here , but rather I 'm just an average `` Joe '' who would like to have decent indoor pictures that looked natural and were not blurred.I would sell this thing on Ebay if I could get more than a few hundred dollars for it , but I 've already invested over $ 1,200 for the snap-on lens adaptors and protective lens cover which keeps the retractable lens from getting damaged . I bought this from a company in Canada back in 2003.All in all I 'm happy with the exterior photos , but am very , very , disappointed with indoor pictures . I guess this thing requires a lot of tweaking , and many , many hours of studying the little manual that Nikon has provided.I would stay away from this and save your money for the newer Digital SLR 's . I 've had this for over four years now , and just wanted to write a review based on my experiences with this camera.Just a thought ...	-1
Without any antenna , I got most of the broadcast channels , most of them are very grainy and sometimes very ghosty . The TV5 , even with its built-in amplifier , did not improve reception much , one channel became very clear , the others actually developed more ghost images , and an extra , WB , was pulled in - also quite grainy . Overall , the pluses and minuses cancelled each other out.I live in downtown Seattle , surrounded by buildings on all sides , but I 'd hoped for more improvement . The performance of this antenna was no better than a cheaper one like the Jensen 631 . That one also had exactly the same effects .	-1
I had this camera although is adorable and it felt as if i was a james bond movie person , it took horrible pictures . The inside pictures if it did n't have the right amount of light the camera would not take pictures at all and when I took pictures outdoors it woould have a blue outline around the images.The saying you get what you pay for is very true .	-1
I tested the Cobra hand held CB on California Rt . 99 today . Not so good . Tuned into truckers ' channel 17 ( for North-South traffic ) and heard mostly noise . There was very little discernible language so I squelched out the noise and waited ... and waited . I called out for a radio check and got a comeback -- loud but not clear . The speaker in that hand held CB is awful . It 's abrasive to listen to.It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road . Perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying . I was looking for a portable system for temporary use , but the Cobra HH Road Trip CB is pretty poor . Personally , I would n't buy it again .	-1
This unit worked well for what it is ; a handheld CB . I was able to transmit and receive greater distances than I expected ( over a mile ) and the sound quality is okay . After 3 months , however , the buttons on the side of the unit for changing channels no longer work at all . I can get to ch9 and ch19 with the instant ch9/19 button on the front of the unit , but the only way to get so a different channel is to scan and hope it stops when someone is talking . I am very disappointed with Cobra customer service as I was told I am basically SOL since the limited warranty is rather limited.In sum , I am now debating between getting another HHROADTRIP like this radio and hoping the buttons remain functions or trying a Midland radio .	-1
Try as I may - and I have really , really tried - the Terk Indoor AM Antenna ADVANTAGE does nothing for my AM reception . My clock radio does not have a receptor for the wire attachment , so I have tried the antenna beside the radio , atop the radio , behind the radio ... turned every which way ... dialed every which way ... I did not try it standing on my head . I have to face it - this gizmo just does not work for me .	-1
I got this to go with my Bose Wave radio to get better reception on a station only 60 miles away . It did n't do a very good job . In fact the Bose worked just as well without it .	-1
The antenna lead was way to short for the antenna to work . Not enough money involved to return the itemso I threw it in the trash .	-1
Clever design for use with and without stand . That it connects to your television or converter box via old design , 75-ohm flat wire results in a weaker signal than should be expected from any modern indoor antenna . I loved the loop antenna for UHF . It made me think of the old days of black-and-white TV .	-1
I was very hopeful that the negative reviews I read about this product were due to operator error , but unfortunately they were not . Although I could get them to work , they were very intermittent and touchy.I called the company that makes them and they did warn me that you have to keep them away from metal objects , sunlight or florescent lights . That could have been part of my problem since I located it next to a recliner on an end table near a lamp with an energy saving florescent bulb . Unfortunately , since it had to be plugged into an electrical outlet , it was the only place I could locate it.I returned this item and purchased the One-For-All URC-9910 RF/IR remote for not much more . I put the RF unit in the exact same place that I had the Leap Frog unit and it works 100x 's better . No more worrying about pointing the remote directly at the RF unit.One thing about the URC-9910 combo is that the RF unit only works with the remote that comes with it . Not really a negative , since it has learning capability and I was able to replace the 4 original remotes that I had been using .	-1
I have used these before ... But this version did n't work well.A very short distance being used and it worked for a day and then could never get it to talk again.I would try another brang .	-1
This is a old school gadget that no longer works well in modern age . It did not work as it should . The Co. and Amazon both were nice about it and took it back . Did not work for me . If you get it make sure its worth it . You may want something more current or a better cell phone with the same options .	-1
I owned a perfectly wonderful Pioneer , 100 Disc CD changer . Since my CD collection had approached the 400 mark , I decided to purchase the Sony CDP-CX455 unit , so that I could randomly listen to my entire collection , without constantly changing CD 's . After reading some of the reviews on Amazon , I was reluctant to purchase this unit . Unable to find another unit that would accomodate 400 CD 's , I decided to take a chance and went ahead with the purchase . Big mistake ! After spending hours loading the CD 's into the system and setting it to play on random ( shuffle ) , I soon discovered that several of my CD 's were skipping . I am meticulous with the handling of my CD 's , so I know that the problem was not caused by my mishandling of them . I removed the CD 's that were skipping , hoping that this was an isolated incident . The next day , I turned on the unit and again set it to play songs randomly . Once again , some of the CD 's started skipping . When I removed them from the unit , I noticed that there were scratches on both CD 's . I then called up Sony to explain to them that this particular CD changer has an engineering defect , and that it scratches CD 's . Their response was that they have had no reports of such incidences . I asked to speak with a supervisor , who informed me that this CD changer has been taken off the market and is not being replaced with a similar unit . He said that stores still had them in stock , but once the stock was exhausted there would be no more available . I then asked him why they were not replacing this unit with another 400 CD changer model , and was told that they are getting out of the CD changer business , in favor of DVD/CD combo units . I offered the comment that the reason they are not replacing the CDP-CX455 with a similar unit , is because they know that the CDP-CX455 has an engineering defect , and they are not capable of building a 400 CD unit that is problem free . At any rate , I called the store where I purchased my changer from , and told them that I was returning it because it was scratching my CD 's . I then started the long process of removing the CD 's from the system and was astounded to find that almost 1 out of every 3 CD 's had been scratched by this CD changer . I called back Sony , and their attitude was basically that they could n't care less . Once you buy a Sony product , you are on your own . Their customer support is non existent . Despite the fact that over 100 of my CD 's have been damaged by this unit , their response was that they were sorry , but there is nothing they could do about it . Based on this incident , I will never purchase another Sony product again . If you are planning to purchase this CD player , my advice to you , & quot ; Buyer Beware. & quot ;	-1
nothing amazing as far as a remote control . The macro 's are nice , but can be lived without . It was a solid remote for 8 months or so , then buttons started failing one by one until it was impossible to use , and I had to buy a new one . Buyer , beware ! one-for-all only offers 90 days limited warranty !	-1
I bought this item about two months ago and was happy as can be . No more equipment in the tv room ! About two weeks ago though , I noticed that the unit was slower and slower and I had to hit buttons repeatedly to get things done . It has eventually gotten to the point that it does not work at all . At first I thought it was batteries in the remote , so I replaced those a few times . Then I thought the placement of the IR transmitter was off , so I moved it closer to my AV rack . That worked at first , but the problem persisted so I reprogrammed , but to no avail . Eventually I narrowed it down to the remote unit . Even with the remote RIGHT NEXT TO THE IR Transmitter , it now does not work most of the time . Of course the real problem now is that all my av stuff is in a different room , so standard IR remotes ( why do they even make those still ? ? ? ? ) are out of the question . I will be moving onto something else and keep my fingers crossed.Along the way I learned a few other things ... other reviewers are right in that the memory gets eaten up quickly when you have to program the unit ( which I do with a new LG DVD player ) . In theory , this is a great unit and the remote is very good when it comes to commands . In practice , however , all it did was make me hungry for an RF system that will work more consistently .	-1
I do n't like the fact that I was refused technical support , because D-LINK considers this an obsolete product . I set up the product and could not get back on the Internet .	-1
The bag looks good so there 's no problem there . The problem is that it 's too small . Somehow when viewing the picture , I thought it was larger . In fact the description even says 'large '' . Dont be fooled.It could n't hold my Canon T3 and one lens . The fit was too tight and I had trouble getting them out of the bag . About the only thing I would put into that bag is a small point and shoot camera and even then it would be difficult to add anything else.This is a very small bag . If you need something to carry your camera and lens in , this is not it .	-1
I got this Viking reader after reading all the negative reviews here . I work on the computer industry and usually do not have problems with installing new devices like these . So even after I read the negative reviews , I figured I could make this work with the right drivers.Boy I was wrong . I first installed the drivers which came on the CD . Windows 2000 recognized all the 4 drives and showed them in Windows explorer . Now when I inserted by Compact flash card , it did not recognize the media and kept asking me to insert the disk in the drive.I tried rebooting multiple times , installing and uninstalling the drivers . No luck . I even tried the other drivers recommended by another user in his review . That didnt work either.After 2 days of meddling I gave up and shipped it back to amazon.Note : This drive also looks unusually big for a card reader . The photo is not representative of its actual size .	-1
Had this keyboard connected to my computer for only 15 minutes . Keys did not register when pressed or had to be pressed several times very hard . I may have just got a lemon but I am not buying another Adesso keyboard .	-1
I know it was my fault for not reading the product description carefully enough , but I completely missed the `` PS/2 '' in the description and purchased it . And , since I have n't had a computer with a PS/2 connection since days gone by , I had to return it . What was most disappointing was that ( even though the box suggested that the manufacturer also carried the same keyboard with a USB connection ) I was unable to find it anywhere online . It went back and I had to go back to my search for the perfect mini-keyboard . : - ( Finally bought the Microsoft Arc , and it 'll do the trick , but I really preferred the size and shape of the returned keyboard in several ways . If anyone knows of where I can purchase the same keyboard with a USB connection , please let me know . Thanks !	-1
This is a nice USB hub . It does n't have a bunch of annoying LEDs ; just one to indicate that it has power . It worked great , right up until the two high-amperage ports died ( no power , no data connection ) . I 've had this product for exactly one month and one day , so I 'm one day outside the return window for Amazon.I would like to some things change in future versions:1 ) Do n't fail after a month ( I 'm sure it 's not common , but it 's still frustrating ) 2 ) Longer power cable . I bought this because I want ports accessible from up on my desk . The power cable hardly reaches and can not be routed the way I would like to route it.3 ) Add mounting holes on the bottom . I would like to have mounted it on the underside of the edge of my desk. -- -- Update : I bought another one of these to replace the one that stopped working . It 's started exhibiting the same failure condition that the last one did . I get power from the high-amperage ports , but no data . If this behaves like the last one , power will also stop working on those ports , soon.Something is wrong with these .	-1
It only charges devices for a few seconds then stops charging . Very disappointed with D-Link . Will be returning it shortly for a better model .	-1
I had this product for over 2 weeks . I have a brand new computer wth Windows 7 and three times I had issues with either the mouse not working or the keyboard stop working.In addition , the power cord in the back of the unit falls out , I had to tape it down . In summary , this product is junk like most of the USB hubs out there , a lot of folks have problems with them ( if not now , later they will ) -- - I 'm going back to manually move out USB jacks when i need them . The quality is not there for these products yet , i mean they charge $ 15- $ 30 for this stuff , your not getting reliablity ! They either burn out and/or disconnect periodically . I rather pay $ 100 for a commerical grade product , get it over with and not have the headaches .	-1
My biggest complaint is that the ports seem ... too small ! It 's very difficult to plug in my usb chargers for the iPad and iPhone 5 . Once you get them in ... it 's almost impossible to get them out . You have to wrap the cord around your hand and yank on the cord . I 'm afraid that my iPhone 5 cable will break - and you know how much Apple charges for a new one.Anyways , other than that , it 's not charging my wireless logitech headphones or my xbox 360 play-n-charge controller . Why . Just charge it.I did n't test any of the data capabilities ; I pretty much got it as a USB power strip . And it 's failing . Requested a replacement from Amazon in case I got a bad unit . We 'll see.Update : Got a replacement from Amazon . It has the exact same issues , so it 's a design flaw . Ports are too small and the only ports that really charge an iPhone 5 and iPad are the `` fast charging '' ports , so only two of them of the seven actually do any good for me . Requesting a refund and sticking with my two star review .	-1
Besides being unnecessarily big and bulky for the number of ports it supports , it did not always work.I had problems with my Surface Pro recognizing the devices I plugged into the ports . Sometimes it would recognize them and at other times it would not . So I ended up ditching this device for the Satech instead ( http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BERGFV6/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_23 ) .	-1
This is a nice , small , inexpensive hub with clear instructions . Unfortunately , it does not seem to work with Macs as advertised . When I tried to use it with my iMac G5 , it would not work with powered USB devices ( hp laser printer , powerwave , and ipod ) . My camera 's download cable worked OK , but I did n't buy the hub just to plug one device in . I found a web page online that suggested other Mac users have had this problem with the hub . But neither the D-Link web site nor the Apple web site included any information about the problem I had .	-1
I owned this hub for a year , and twice had to call D-Link for a RMA number to exchange it under warranty . After the third one died , I just gave up . I spent more on shipping than I would have spent on just buying a new hub from a different manufacturer.So what went wrong ? In each case the hub seemed to overheat and die . I could actually smell that distinct odor of frying circuit board . Never had anything particularly power-hungry hooked up : two iPods , a scanner , a digital camera.I understand if it happened once , or even twice , but three times a bad hub ? Not likely . Since the new hub I got from a different manufacturer is working well , then the conclusion must be that it is the D-Link design that is at fault .	-1
Thankfully - I was able to return it to the store after 5 days . So what was wrong with it -Firstly - for hardware revision B4 , the software just would not install ( some error about security code not being valid ) . Wasted many hours over this . A call to D-link tech support resulted in an email from them that only repeated steps I had already tried . Not very helpful and more waste of time.I wrote back in a stern manner - and tech support finally got back with a solution that involved installing the older driver along with a security code that they generated.OK - I was willing to live with this much . When I tried to use the device with the Jabra 250 BT headphone , I managed to get a range of around 18 feet and there was absolutely no signal one room away . Even within a room - signal was weak by the time I went to the end of the room . What was this claim about 30 feet range ? This was awful performance and I decided I had enough and returned the product.Fast forward to my Linksys USBBT100 - . Firstly - it installed in a snap . The Jabra 250 now works through the furthest corner of the other rooms - no breakup - nothing . Boy - what a glaring difference.I for one will stay away from D-link for a long time to come !	-1
I bought this product because I use them on my macs so I figured stick with dlink on this but what a mistake , the driver is a total disaster ! it loads generic drivers then it complains about a security code then if you get that all worked out the driver will then declare you do not have a valid license ! This thing is useless in windows ! That driver is a joke ! Seriously do not buy this for windows it will not work !	-1
Device driver would not install . Simply hangs . Second , this is an OEM of a Toshiba bluetooth adapter . I can not stand OEM 'd products such as this because the support is terrible . Returning the product.Also bought a d-link usb 2.0 hub that locked the computer every time I plugged it in to a known good port , using a known good cable.Probably wo n't ever buy d-link again .	-1
I own this mouse first , then just bought another one : Logitech Wheel Mouse Optical . Logitech is clearly the better choice at a comparable price . It 's ( logitech ) more responsive , comfortable , accurate , better feel , better look ... .. Unless this microsoft one is free , go get the logitech .	-1
I have one of these mice , but it was n't purchased here . Like several other Microsoft mice I have purchased it came with a defective microswitch under the left button . Most of the time it works , but sometimes when you single-click you get a double . Microsoft mice used to be great , they are no more.I have purchased 4 or 5 of the past couple years out of brand loyalty and only 1 of them worked correctly out of the box and it only lasted a few months .	-1
It 's extremely unfortunate but I ca n't help looking at this as a predatory product . There 's no good reason to make the camera require a proprietary design to begin with but then to charge this much money for it -- it 's insulting . The quality is fine but for less than half the cost , you can buy a charger plus four AA batteries and recharge them galore . Heck , you could buy three more sets of perfectly good AA batteries and never ever run out of juice.I 'm a Canon fan but enough is enough . The camera 's Excellent , the lenses are Fair to Good , the AC adapter is a bad buy for the money .	-1
Hoped to replace an aging microphone screen with this one and eventhough it met the specs , it tore immediately and fell off - so - waste of money .	-1
This quick disconnect cord was purchased to replace one that was misplaced . We 'd bought the first cord along with a Plantronics headset , and both had worked excellently for several months for my wife , who uses the phone many hours daily in a sales situation . When the original quick disconnect cord was misplaced , we purchased the exact same model as a replacement , even paying 2nd day shipping to get back to full function quickly.What a disappointment and waste of money . Whereby the first cord and the headset mated perfectly and worked without flaw , there have been consistent sound quality problems since starting to use this second cord . There are no visible problems with the cord , and I eventually tried some spray contact cleaner as I connected and disconnected the quick disconnect plugs of the cord and headset to see if that would help to produce a robust connection . The issue with poor sound quality persists.Fortunately , we found the original , misplaced version of this cord a couple of days ago , and thankfully it still works flawlessly.So ... Two versions of this same cord ... two distinctly different results in functionality and/or quality . While the confort and sound quality of the Plantronics headset has been a blessing for my wife , I 'm not sure we 'd order this combination again due to the variations in quality with this cord .	-1
So , these are supposed to work in stand alone CD recorders ? Not quite . When the CD 's arrived . half of the CD 's I tried in my recorder were n't recognized ( no OPC ) and those that did , I had to put in my machine more than once in order for my machine to recognize the OPC code , so I could record on the disc . Hmm , not exactly what I was looking for , so they are going back . Guess I should have stuck with Maxell . I 'll be correcting that mistake as I return these discs .	-1
I have these and a bunch of TDK brand CD Markers . After comparing these to the TDKs , I 'm trashing the Memorex ones . They are that bad .	-1
I bought this thinking since its expensive , it will be better . but I plugged it in and the red light came on , I read the manual and it said if the red light comes on you need to change the wiring at your house ( which I didnt have time nor money for it ) then I threw it away and bought a cheap one which is working perfect .	-1
we had a lot of fluctuating voltage a during the hot summer months . i used on on my refrigerator , but my refrigerator circuit board still got destroyed . i used on my microwave . still had to buy a new microwave . used on on my stove . every morning i noticed that the clock on the stove blinking which tells me the current got knocked off and then came on again a few minutes later . used on my computer . the computer cable got knocked out but the computer was ok. had to buy a new cable . so i am not sure that this thing really works	-1
The circuit breaker tripped after a few months . I tried the re-set - no go . It was irreparably burned out .	-1
I have a customer with three HP2300DN printers that used these 615n cards . With these three printers they now have seven dead 615n cards with the HP acknowledge built in fault . We just recently ordered a set of newer style cards to replace the last three working 615ns in the printers . HP really screwed up on these and did not make it right with their base .	-1
Purchased July 23 , it 's now Aug 5th and the thing is dead . No Power . Dunno what the warranty is , am going to try and contact them , but honestly , that amount of time indicates the thing sucks .	-1
I really wanted to like this device , but it makes it very hard to do so . It is well designed , I like the size of the ball , but the button placement leaves a lot to be desired , especially the main button ( `` left '' ) . There are two things Logitech must improve . First , this thing is a battery drain , which is expensive and environmentally unsound . Second , it 's interface to the computer ( Mac OS X ) is strange . Many times the behavior is as if the left button is continuously pressed , it would attempt to drag objects I have no interest in dragging and so on . This device will end in the trash and I will buy a new trackball from another manufacturer . Other , less important irritants are erratic pointer movement and the fact that it does not work well in direct sunlight .	-1
First , I am a huge fan of trackballs . I am still using a trackball `` Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse '' that I purchased in 2000 after talking it to war in Iraq in the desert . It still works like a champ . I bought this wireless one to use with my Boxee Box as mouse navigation is really slow on the device . The default tracking sensitivity is so low though that the ball was way to unresponsive . I believe you can fix this with windows settings of the software that comes with the mouse but that does not work for Boxee . Beyond that , I am not sure why they changed the ergonomic design so much from the `` Logitech Trackman Marble Mouse '' . I found this design to be bulky ; the wireless receiver is large and the trackball did not feel comfortable . Also I found the button placement to be awkward . For me I do not think my comfort would be improved with more use , it just felt rather carpal tunnel inducing .	-1
I bought this trackball mouse to:1 . ) Limit movement of wrist2 . ) Limit rotation of forearm by holding trackball mouse in semi-'handshake ' position on my lap . The goal here being to limit use of the pronator teres muscle to avoid repetitive stress injury.This mouse fails with respect to 2 . ) Holding the mouse in one 's lap necessitates some sort of orientation calibration ... but this is not available in the Mac OS X drivers Logitech provides.Additionally , the movement of the cursor is just not smooth enough for me ... sometimes too jittery , especially in comparison to the ergonomic Microsoft mouse I bought as a replacement.Also , no horizontal scrolling ? Lack of horizontal scrolling severely limits usefulness in photo editing , video editing , PDF file reading , etc . In fact , IMHO , 360 degree scrolling should become a standard ... & this mouse is far from it.Finally , the feel & placement of the buttons is 'just not right ' . In fact , I enjoyed using the good old corded 2-button Marble Mouse trackball by Logitech . It felt great , and it was even smoother ... lack of scrolling , though , makes it a non-option for me.I was fairly disappointed . I would still like to find a good trackball mouse to limit my wrist movement , but , for now , it will be the rather excellent ergonomic ( entire mouse is rotated a bit clockwise ) Microsoft cordless laser mouse in conjunction with an extruding arm rest from my desk.However , I do think that if Logitech wrote better drivers for this mouse , it *could* be an excellent product . The jittery ( not smooth ) movement of the mouse , though , still puzzles me . The corded version is very smooth , and my Microsoft wireless mouse is also very smooth , so I 'd be surprised if it were just *my* setup ... I guess try before you buy : )	-1
Item did not state it was not 10- 1000 as is current models in this pro line . Of no use for purpose I needed . There response was not good so will just not use them or recommend them .	-1
So here 's the thing , when I lived in Phoenix , and I had this certain cable internet provider , and it worked . Granted I had a bit of trouble getting it to work right off the bat . But , then it worked , and that was that.Then I move to Albuquerque , and this other cable internet provider , and I could not get it to work . I even called Netgear , and even though the guy on the line was very nice , and very helpful , it still would n't work ! I finally went down to the store , and got myself a new router by a different manufacturer , and that one worked . & lt ; shrug >	-1
This router was a real hassle to install . If you know all about networking and ISPs and all the numbers associated with all your equipment , then you can save 3 bucks and buy this box . I am no techie and found it impossible to install AND , when I was done hassling with the tech-support , it turned out that the Netgear router was not compatible with Xbox Live and the Xbox 360 , which is what I bought it for in the first place . Instead , I now have a Linksys BEFSR41 EtherFast Cable/DSL Router with 4-Port 10/100 Switch . It was a breeze to install , virtually plug-and-play , and it works with the Xbox . The Linksys unit was well worth the extra 3 bucks .	-1
I have used the FVS318 for about 4 years now . I was hit by lightening and blew out one router on my VPN . I bought a new one to replace it and found that the new V3 is not backward compatible with the older versions . I had to totally reconfigure the unit and purchase another one to replace the older unit that DID work . Netgear also has posted on their website that they will in no way pay or discount the purchase of a new router due to the lack of backward compatibility . I would suggest going away from this router and possibly going away from netgear . I have been a huge netgear fan in the past , but ... I recently replaced my personal wireless router with a Linksys .	-1
The firewall/router portion of the FR114P is great and easy to set up , but the print server is useless ! I have a Canon i850 on Windows XP , and it drags the print speed down so low that you want to cry . While printing graphics it literally pauses for a second or two after each pass of the print head . After installing via the recommended method ( Netgear 's virtual firewall printer port ) , I found a tidbit of two cryptic sentences on their website that suggested installing the printer via the Windows LDP/LPR port as a remedy for slow printing . This made no difference . Tech support then suggested turning off print buffering on the Windows printer settings . This only made matters worse as it still printed slowy but now also ties up the computer until it 's done ! I returned the FR114P and will now try the D-Link DI-704UP which has a USB print server . This thing 's great if you do n't mind paying an extra $ 40 for print server functionality that you 'll never want to use !	-1
I ordered a SanDisk Flash Card & received a brand that would not work in my embroidery machine . I store all of my embroidery designs on flash cards & the computer in my machine only excepts certain brands of flash cards . I can only store 100 designs on each card because that 's all that my machine will recognize . When I order SanDisk in the future , this is what I want .	-1
I bought this card reader to use with my laptop so I would n't have a USB reader hang off the side , just waiting to get broken off . To my disappointment , this reader is incredibly slow . Slow enough to make it not worth the money , no matter how little it costs.Here 's some specs on my analysis : * Test was performed with a Dell Latitude D630 w/ Intel Core2Duo Laptop* Memory card used was a Sandisk Extreme III 8GB Compact Flash* Transfer of thirty-six ( 36 ) 10.2 megapixel images ( ~4MB each ) , total size of ~160MB** From D630 to Extreme III CF card via PCMCIA , the transfer took approx 5 minutes** From Extreme III CF card to D630 via PCMCIA , the transfer took approx 4 minutes** From D630 to Extreme III CF card via generic USB 2.0 reader , the transfer took approx 20 seconds** From Extreme III CF card to D630 via generic USB 2.0 reader , the transfer took approx 20 secondsJust consider , this was only 36 photos ( ~160MB total ) . If I travel with my laptop and take hundred or thousands of photos and needs to backup or download them , I would most definitely need to bring my power supply . And when you travel , bringing more stuff to weigh you down is the last thing you want to do.So , with results like these , its clear why I 'm in the process of returning this item . I hope you all think twice before ordering this reader .	-1
I bought this reader for my laptop since it did n't have USB 2.0.But to tell you the truth , I think this device is a little slower than USB 1.0 ! I am going to buy the Lexar 32Bit card and see if that improves the download speed , because this reader is so slow.It took me about 45min to download 2GB of photos from my Extreme III card . That is unacceptable .	-1
Ordered these Cyber-Acoustic CA-2022 's based on reviews and previous experience with Cyber Acoustics . I have a Cyber Acoustics set ( with subwoofer ) I purchased at Costco a decade ago that are absolutely amazing . While I did n't expect miracles for $ 19.99 , I was hoping for a great `` bang for the buck '' from Cyber Acoustics in the CA-2022 's . IMHO , these speakers deliver muddy sound throughout the entire frequency spectrum . NOTE TO CYBER ACCOUSTICS : I would have gladly paid 3 times as much for a stereo pair ( w/o sub ) that deliver clean/clear sound . On a positive note I also ordered a Cyber Acoustics CA-492 iPod/iPhone speaker dock that does a great job . The CA-492 delivers the exceptional `` Bang for the Buck '' that I have come to expect from Cyber Acoustics .	-1
I purchased 3 pairs for an office to be shared by 3 people ( myself and 2 others ) . The only criteria was cheap , headphone jack and decent looking , and these fit the bill , except ... Like others here , the USB power method seemed like a good idea to save plug usage . It may be a good `` idea '' , but as some others have noted , the implementation of the idea is fatally flawed.There 's a HUGE amount of noise using headphones and a 5.8GHz cordless phone on the same desk causes an irritating tone when in use that only stops by turning the speakers off.Very disappointed so hopefully they can be returned despite 2 with no packaging .	-1
These speakers appeared to be a good basic pair of speakers for those who want a no-frills , inexpensive system . They look pretty nice , admittedly . Power is drawn through a USB port , which is a nice idea - no bulky transformer . And herein lies the problem.Power from the USB port needs to be filtered ; on these speakers , it is definitely not . They hiss , crack , and transmit/amplify every electronic interference signal that comes out of your PC . Move your mouse , and you hear clicking . CD-ROM usage is even worse . The noise renders the speakers unusable , for even the most patient among us.For the price , they 're not even worth the effort to return ship them . These are totally unusuable and going straight into the trash .	-1
poor transmission quality and difficult to swap around to different channels while trying to drive at the same time .	-1
Initially , I purchased the iRock to connect a CD player to my car stereo . Sound quality is very good , so long as you are n't in an area where broadcast stations use all the limited frequencies of 88.1 to 88.7 offered on the iRock . ( Other products offer a wider choice . ) Where I live , college radio uses 88.1 and 88.3 , and NPR is on 88.5 , with a strong signal classical station on 88.9 , so NONE of the iRock 's channels provides real clear sound . The connector cord , which fits into the headphone jack of the player , is also too long . It worked okay when I had a CD player , but now I have an iPod , and the cord is just annoyingly too long , causing the iRock 's main pod to slide off the car seat and dangle to toward the floor , where gravity eventually causes it to detach from my iPod . What a pain !	-1
This is great if all of electrical devices you are connecting to it are lamps or some other device with a similarly narrow plug . This is supposed to be a 7 outlet surge protector yet the outlets are so cramped together that I can only use 4 outlets .	-1
I would n't purchase these again if I only needed one outlet space available , They are a little bulky and then you can not use the other jack and it covers up the entire outlet leaving you with only one jack ( all be it one surge protected jack )	-1
I bought this & # 34 ; protector & # 34 ; about a year ago about one month before I bought my $ 3,000 projector . I thought about protection before I purchased my projector because it was very important I did n't lose what I spent my hard earned money . The warranty claim of Belkin and great reviews were hard to pass up ... and a hard lesson that words on a piece of paper do not mean much. & # 34 ; The Story & # 34 ; : One night I was watching TV on my projector when a storm rolled in and lightning struck near by . The lights in the room went out then back on within a second . The audio through my receiver was still playing along with the DVR , all of which was on a separate surge protector . The projector , however , never came back on , it was dead , the surge protector was still on ... both lights still going as if nothing happened . In my home I have 3 TVs , 3 computers , 2 A/V receivers and several more expensive electrical components on multi-outlet surge protectors ... *nothing* was touched except for the projector on this dedicated single-outlet surge protector.The claim to Belkin was sent in within the 15 days required , along with the surge protector ( still working ) , the purchase receipt of both the protector and projector to show the sole purpose of the purchase was for just such an occasion . Also sent to them was the professional repair diagnosis and repair estimate ( $ 1,500 parts alone ) , the power supply was dead as well as the main circuit board . This was also proof the damage occurred through the outlet and not some magical event . Belkin ran their tests and simulated *minor* surges and found no issues and therefore were not liable . They even sent back the exact protector so I could continue to use it ... very thoughtful ... Long story short , do n't *ever* expect to make a claim with Belkin and receive compensation for a failure to protect your equipment . There is no honor in this company and I will *never* buy Belkin again . I have never had a failure before and I hope no one has to go through such an expensive trial and error as I have .	-1
This was poor quality , because it only has one plug instead of two . The second place for a plug was a piece of plastic	-1
Got this to add a couple of outlets in the bedroom . Firstly , it only has prongs that plug into one outlet -- not two , like most you find elsewhere . Secondly , it does not replace the outlet cover -- you remove the screw , but leave the outlet cover in place and attach this over it . I do n't think I 'd plug anything into it that drew much power ,	-1
This thing randomly stopped working after a few weeks of perfectly fine use.Prior to that , the only problem I had was that it takes up too much space . Although it has prongs for only one socket , you ca n't put it in the bottom socket and have the top socket free , for example . Also , the fact that it uses one socket , and has six ports drawing energy from that one socket , probably contributed to its completely conking out .	-1
I do not like these . They do not snap closed , therefore , they do not work well to hold the CD in . They are ok as long as you just want to put them on a CD rack or in the car , but you must hold on to it when you pick it up or the CD will fall right out . I had some clam-shell cases before that were great . Do n't know if I just got a bad batch .	-1
I 've used this camera for 6 years . Last year I started getting intermittant `` Remove the Cassette '' messages . I wish I had captured the outstanding three recorded tapes onto my PC then . Instead I recorded another 45 minutes . Now , the error message is solid , no matter which tape I use.My experience with Canon in the past has taught me not to waste the time or the money to bother having this repaired . ( I spent about $ 700 having my previous Canon Camcorder repaired . It worked a few weeks and died again each time . ) Having gone to the web to research this bug , I 'm convinced fixing this one will be an expensive and time consuming exercise in futility . ( 6 weeks plus turn around ! and Canon wo n't tell how much the average repair cost is . Check the web .. $ 500+ ) Lesson learned . I 'll be shopping a different manufacturer . Sony ? JVC ? Never again Canon .	-1
Not worth the money . I actually receive MORE HDTV channels with a cheap , plain-old UHF antenna . This is simply junk : Do n't waste your money .	-1
Decent reception most of the time , but it looks very flimsly out of the box , did n't have a very high WAF , and the solder joint connecting the Coax to the antenna broke within a month of getting the thing . Consider spending a bit more on a more substantial antenna .	-1
I bought this antenna when I bought my Samsung SIR-T151 HDTV Receiver . So far I have n't been able to get good performance from it . In fact I 've been able to get better reception using an old FM dipole antenna like you use with a stereo receiver .	-1
This router would be no stars if possible . I just spent two hours trying every trick mentioned on DSLREPORTS.COM to get this working with NO success . Flashing to previous and newer firmware had no effect . I spoke with a CLEC tech on the other end of the connection who reported fragmented packet errors . Swapping out the router resolved the issue . We were using SBC DSL Speedstream 5100 connection hardware known good , I did n't have another brand on hand to check harware compatability . I 'd highly recommend another router ... do n't venture down this path.Regards , Jeff	-1
... and unfortunately the firmware sucks ! Google `` BEFSX41 firmware upgrade problems '' and see what you get . I had mine running a stable ( but vulnerable ) firmware and decided to download the latest firmware from Linksys ' site to close the security hole . Unfortunately it was n't until numerous problems began ( router reboots , disconnects , no internet connection ) that I checked for firmware issues and found problems via Google . There are NO WARNINGS on that Linksys download site . They are essentially providing software to BREAK your product ! It got so bad , I could n't connect to the internet anymore . I had to go to work to download an older firmware ( unfortunately Linksys DOES NOT provide these ! ) from dslreports . They fixed most of my problems , but there is a list of bugs that still have not been fixed . Fortunately , I do n't use the features that trigger those bugs . I 'm providing the link so that someone who has purchased it can upgrade their firmware at THEIR DISCRETION ! Otherwise , I would say do not buy this product ! It 's unnecessary headaches when other routers will work just as well . ( Though I hear D-Link products also have problems ) [ ... ]	-1
I never had a DVR ( aside from my computer ) before , so when I finally managed to get my Tivo all hooked up , I was really impressed . I especially love the `` Season Pass '' feature which will pick out all the times your favorites program airs , and let you schedule recording for all of them in a few clicks.But then the headaches began ... ( 1 . ) First of all , how many of us have the telephone line near our TVs ? Normally , the TV and electronic gadgets are on one side of the room , and the phone is on the other - right ? Tivo needs a phone line to get it 's program information - at least initially . So if your house is configured like mine , be prepared to have phone line extensions strewn all across your living room while you spend up to a day downloading and installing all the program information by phone.So of course , I almost began to drool when I read in the Manual that you can actually connect the Tivo to your local or wireless network. ( 2 . ) Problem is , you most likely will NOT be able to connect your Tivo to your local or wireless network . I took Tivo 's own approved list of hardware ( direct network adapters or wireless receivers ) to my local geek toy store , and bought the top recommended networking connection on the list . That did n't work , so I returned it and bought the next recommended item on Tivo 's list . That did n't work either , so over the course of the next two weeks I tried three ( yes , 3 ) more . Nothing . I finally gave up , and had to buy a long extension cord for my phone line and install it more perminent-like. ( 3 . ) The main reason I 'm here today , is because I found this page while searching for an explanation to the weird high pitched whistle noise my Tivo began making last night ( after only 2 months of ownership ) . Turns out this is apparently an increasingly common problem - which I never heard of until today - and even more unfortunately seems to indicate that my Tivo will be totally dead in the next few days . Right now , it 's literally delaying everything I do ( trying to view my cable box 's program guide , etc ) by 30 seconds or more ( the normal lag time should be around 1 or 2 seconds ) So , since I 've already paid for the lifetime membership , I 'm now searching for a relatively cheap way I can fix the problem myself . Do I need to replace the harddrive , the case fans , ..or what ? By the way , if Tivo goes out of business , how will I get my program guide ? Tivo does n't grab the FREE TV Guide data from your cable like the no-subscription-required Panasonics can. ( 4 . ) Oh , and also wanted to warn people about one more thing that only starts happening after you 've had your Tivo for a few weeks - which is actually intentional on the part of Tivo - but which is n't mentioned anywhere in any of their manuals or documentation , for obvious reasons ... After a few weeks ( if your Tivo still works ) , you 'll start to get little on-screen pop-up alerts RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR FAVORITE PROGRAM which stay there for atleast 30 seconds until you click it or patiently wait for it to go away . And what are these prompts ? ADVERTISING which actually is made to look like a really important subscriber announcement from Tivo . Maybe it 's important to THEM , but I 'd rather NOT see it in the middle of my TV screen . Actually , that 's yet another example of Tivo 's dumb implimentation : You 'll only see this advertising if you 're watching live TV instead of the recorded programming ... and since most people with Tivos are watching the recorded programs instead of live TV , Tivo 's sponsors are paying for ads that few people will ever see ... Great business ideas - yes ? ) In addition to these on-screen ads which interrupt your viewing , when you go to your Tivo menu , you 'll find atleast TWO links to advertisements . The really bad thing about these links in particular is that they are positioned in the place where your other normal Tivo menu options are listed . So instead of selecting your `` To Do List '' or upcoming recordings , you might accidently find yourself watching a series of advertisements - WHICH YOU CAN NOT DELETE OR REMOVE.OK , so that 's all I have to say at this point . Seems to me that Tivo had a great idea , but terrible implimentation . I do n't know about their customer service , but I probably also wo n't even bother , if it 's going to cost me $ 100 to $ 150 to ship them back their own defective product anyway.If I ca n't fix the Tivo , and I 'm not in the mood to pay double-or-triple in trying to get it fixed , then it 's apparently just become one nice looking but useless paperweight ... to which I have a lifetime subscription .	-1
I am happy with the picture quality of this web cam . However , the mechanical leaves a lot to be desiredWith one day of using it , the camera head started flopping around . Looks like the spring this is supposed to be holding the head on to the base is very weak and after pointing the camera a few times , it became very loose and there is no way to tighten it or adjust it.I thought I just had a bad one so I exchanged it . When I got the new one home , I was as careful as I can be . But within one week , the same thing happened . It is obviously a mechanical design flaw . The worse part is that the USB cable attached to the camera head is long and thick relatively to the camera . With the camera head being loose , the cable now controls which direction the carmea points to.This makes the camera almost unusable .	-1
I have to give this thing a somewhat poor rating because the documentation and web support are weak . I could not get this device to work with my Windows XP Pro system ( I am very computer literate ) and Yahoo Messenger 5.5 . I 'm not sure if it 's a Windows/Yahoo/Logitech problem , but after cleaning my computer 's registry , searching for tech notes , installing/reinstalling/uninstalling , I could not get this thing to work ( I threw away many hours of my life trying ) ! I gave up on my desktop computer ( Win XP machine ) and installed on my Windows 2000 Pro laptop ... bingo ! It worked . For the price , it 's not horrible , but I do n't love it . The software bundle is a bit cheesy . As far as being `` flimsy '' as others have written ... I 'm not sure how rugged it needs to be sitting on your monitor ? ! I have enjoyed making stupid faces at my brother in-law who lives in San Diego ... our kids love it too .	-1
I 'm very disappointed in BOSE . I bought these for a BOSE 301-V that I was mounting on the wall . These worked , but it was n't as easy of an installation as it should have been . Step one in the instructions is to *drill a hole* in the back of the speakers . There are pictures that show & # 34 ; drill in a bit , but not too far & # 34 ; , without much additional information . Not classy . It feels like a crime to drill holes into a brand new speaker.They come with screws for mounting directly into studs , through drywall , and into masonry . They link up pretty well and feel secure . Be advised , that if you are installing into drywall , the anchors that they provide require a 1/2 & # 34 ; hole -- they are pretty well sized .	-1
I purchased this thing , so I could watch the MLB All-Star game from within the Stadium . Let me tell you , the reception is so mediocre , I 'm not even going to bother lugging this mini monster to the game with me.I tested out reception from 3 different places . Inside my home , along the open waterfront area of New York Bay , and within the city amongst the skyscrapers . All were equally poor in quality.In the days when you convert video to an iPod format ( yes I know it 's not live TV ) that is crystal clear , and awesomely bright , this thing seems as quaint as a spinning wheel . Granted , it might be ok in a hurricane or emergency situation , but if the signal really will drop all together in a year or two , when they switch over to full hi-def , this is no more than a paper weight waiting to happen . Save your money , and wait until something like satellite for portable TV 's comes out.In general the picture works , but requires the long telescoping antenna , and the signal varies , while your watching it .	-1
maxell has been one of my trusted use for blank discs for longer than i can remember.up until sometime in 2005 ... when maxell changed their discs.heres the differencethe 2004 model has the maxell guy on rhe left , and the cdr/80/700 tihng on the right . on the top it says maxell in big letters . also if you feel the background , it is a whole lot more stable . it doesnt chip easily . also the plastic used was not scratched easily.the 2005/2006 model is a whole lot worse . it says cd-r onl eft , highlighted . on top of that it has maxell in small letters . on the right it says 80/700 and the maxell guy is right below it . the top of the disc is obviously used with cheaper material , and it scratches easily.another thing noticeable from the two is burn errors . ive had no burn errors at all with either of the 2004 models ( regular or music ) . on the 2005 model at least 80 % failed.also when using nero express i tested imation and sony cd-rs just to make sure my recorder was ok. imation had a 10 % fail rate and sony had a 0 % fail rate ... my recorder works fine.also , i tried burning at slower speed with no better results.why would imation and sony work on my computer and maxell wouldnt . because maxell cd-rs are garbage . avoid at all costs get imation sony or get maxell but only if the discs look like i explained on the 2004 modle becuase those were literally the best cdrs ive ever owned .	-1
I should have never ordered this item . Should have read the negative reviews first . Save yourself the $ 2.40 . Got this thing and the first day it breaks . My speaker fell off my desktop and the plug broke right off like it was nothing . Not worth the metal its made with . Do n't order it . I decided to take the loss of my $ 2.40 since I 'd rather not deal with customer service , even if I could get a refund .	-1
I bought this for a product video I was doing for myself and wanted to do some slow pans with minimal `` jerkiness '' . For the price I did n't expect a top-notch , professional panning head , but I did expect there would be some fluid dampening when panning . However , it is strictly a frictional head . No matter what I tried with this tripod , I could not find that `` sweet spot '' between not enough friction and too much . Too much and the head binds , and too little and it flops around aimlessly . This tripod is excellently priced for something that does n't work well . On the good side , the return policy for Tie Photo & Electronics Inc. , was good and I was able to return the tripod and buy the ePhoto Professional Video Camera Fluid Drag Tripod Head by ePhoto INC 717AH from Amazon instead . I paid only $ 79 for the head and attached it to an old tripod ( quality ) I had , although I did have to buy this adapter to make that work : Manfrotto 088LBP Adapter 1/4-Inch- 20 to 3/8-Inch with flange . If you 're looking for a cheap tripod for home use and do n't care about panning , then this might be a good choice . It does come with a built-in level , but do n't be mislead by the `` 3-way Fluid-Effect Head '' . There 's nothing fluid about it .	-1
I do n't expect superior quality in these low-priced tool kits , but I was definitely disappointed in this product.The screwdriver is essentially useless . It is a clever design with a swivel head , but poorly designed . It is a challenge to keep the head straight and sturdy when used as an ordinary screwdriver . I ca n't imagine one would fare any better with the head set at a 90 degree angle.I broke down and bought a Klein multi-tip screwdriver as a replacement -- that improved the utility of the kit immensely.The flashlight is useless . In this day and age , a cheapy incandesent flashlight is little more than a toy . A compact LED flashlight would have been a better choice.Overall , if you replace the screwdriver , the kit is serviceable . Otherwise , look elsewhere .	-1
See the attached photo ( when it appears ) to see the problem . A gap in the needle nose pliers that should not be when fully closed .	-1
Not a heavy duty outlet strip . If it did not cost so much I would have returned . Found a heavy duty outlet strip at Walmart for less money . Do not waste your money on this item .	-1
This is a great product for my Laptop and I use one all the time . The reason I rated it a 2 is because the average lifespan on one is about a month ... some will last 2 or 3 and 1 quit in one day . I have a box of about 20 that either the ball quit or the clicker broke . I may package them someday and send back to Fellows . However , when they work , they are really good to do graphics and easy to get details with the pointer . My recommendation is that if you can afford these , they are great , or if you have the patience to send back to Fellowes , they will replace free . Overall : Shop around for good value , expect detailed use for short time , save package and if we all send them back ... maybe they could be made to last a little more than a month .	-1
This did n't do what I expected , respect the other readers and note that this does n't convert the signal from analog to digital .	-1
I bought this so I could use a DVI cable and hook my PC to my TV . I had been using a VGA cable with an adapter on my PC , but wanted to push my TV so it was flush with the entertainment center ( the DVI to VGA cable prevented this as it was on the back of the PC ) This cable would have been perfect if it had worked ! I tried several DVI cables that I knew worked , and no signal at all . I am returning this to Amazon today ...	-1
I purchased this to use with my iPhone 3GS ( 8GB ) . After numerous tries , it kept telling me that the phone did not support charging through that device . I tried it on my iPod touch 4th gen ( 16GB ) and it worked for about 5 minutes then stopped . Tried again and same thing kept happening . I considered returning the product until I found out that it could charge my PS3 controller . I guess I 'll keep it , but it certainly did not work with my iPhone and iPod touch like it was supposed to .	-1
I bought this camera bag because it was on sale but when I got it I discovered that it is a bit on the bulky side . It 's a little larger than what I was expecting . If you do n't mind toting a larger bag for you little camera than I would say buy it but if you bought your camera because it 's easier to carry than I would avoid purchasing it .	-1
I bought this modem to run with my IVM ( Interactive Voice Machine ) I did finely get it to work . Some problems I encountered.No CD and not enough paperwork to download the drivers . I called tech support and they said download here . The driver they have was n't an exe file . I spent too much time figuring it out . I had to beat it into my computer . ( lol ) Full duplex no way this is a half duplex modem . just copy the full duplex and half duplex and past it into Google and do your research . Also the caller I.D did n't work at all . BummerThe Multi-Tech website has software that you can download to use with the modem but you had to buy it . I did try the software but I would n't buy it for the price . It was hard to use and it had a doss like look and ran like doss . you can find better phone software on the net .	-1
I 'm lucky if I can get it to download 50 meg without locking up . Only supporte 128 meg cards - NOT 256 . Will NOT support Secure digital cards . Built like a plastic toy.Not happy . Am returning this piece of junk .	-1
This Netgear MR814V3 ( meaning version 3 ) router has so thoroughly messed up my network , it 's just unbelievable . I tried to replace an old Apple Airport base station with this router . I have a Dell with a Microsoft USB Wi-Fi adapter , an iMac with an old Airport card , and they all worked fine with my old Airport base station , but I wanted some more ethernet ports . I hooked up the Netgear and everything went to pot ! After fiddling and fiddling , I got the Dell to talk to it wirelessly and the iMac to work on one of the Netgear 's ethernet ports , it would n't work on the Wi-Fi at all . But that 's not what I wanted , and the thing kept dropping the connection . I emailed Netgear 's customer support , and guess what they said ! They would be happy to help me if I would pay them $ 30 ! ! ! It seems there is some fine print INSIDE THE BOX , that says support is only free if my whole network is Netgear equipment . The box says `` 24/7 Technical Support '' on the outside . OK , so I am only paying $ 20 for this thing , it is now unreturnable , I give up . I put the Airport back into my network , I pulled the Netgear out and tried to put my network back like it was . No soap ! My iMac ca n't seem to find the Airport base station and the Dell periodically drops the connection . This Netgear thing has screwed up my whole system ! Wow ! I guess I 'm on my way to the Apple store to get a new Airport , instead . I hope they can give me some clues on how to fix the iMac 's Airport card.Unless you have an all Netgear system , DO NOT buy this ( or any other ) piece of Netgear equipment .	-1
This is my 2nd wireless router , ( I am not counting my access points ) . I 'm a tester in a network company , so I 've done sone detailed observation.Pros : Netgear did an awesome job by making this 'slick ' looking router with nice lights . There 's even a sticker which explains what each lights are for . Setup is straight forward . For most people , they will only need to stick with first 2 pages ( and sub-pages of those ) to get everything done.The ugly : First-You 'll start to get into some hairy stuff with the wifi page . When you set the 'country ' and 'channel ' , you will notice that after refresh it disappears . Sometimes it sticks , but most of the time , you have to do this several times . Not only that , the help tab does not show up until you 've made a change . Obviously a bug.Second-The port forwarding on the older firmware is flaky . You will need to upgrade your firmware to the latest released , which was in May.The really UGLY stuff.My SMC router was working fine in an urban environment . If I sniff the air , I see 5 other routers . So , I plug this thing in , put it on the same channel as SMC and it just flaked out . This router can not be trusted to be up 24x7 yet . Occasionally it will just die , and require a hard boot . After the firmware upgrade , router seems to have stabilized , but prior to this , it would die every other day from who-knows-what.In short , this router is pretty nice looking , and seems to have stabilized with '4.11 ' firmware revision . The new firmware has only been out for couple of weeks , and I 've only had to reboot once . After you upgrade the firmware , I recommend that you hard reset it via the button on the unit.For now , I can not recommend this product.I 've tested it with ISO downloads with the new firmware ( Redhat 9 , 3 iso 's each with ~700megs ) and the thing stayed up . Prior to that , this thing would hang . If you are going to power this thing on and off every day , then it 's a good deal But if you want something you want to configure once , and deal with it maybe 4x a year , this unit has not proven itself to me . The new firmware seems to be great , but it 's only been 2 weeks since it 's release ( installed the day after it was released ) , and it took them 3 months to release it . Then again , I can not recommend SMC either . If you have the money , and are willing to pay for stability , Linksys seems to be the choice.BTW : There 's a 2nd version of this router , and it 's supposidly smaller , and no longer has the 'detachable ' antenna .	-1
The Netgear MR814 802.11b Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router is very easy to set up and required no software . I like the Firewalls and parental control options that this router provides . Internet accessible from anywhere at home . And it is compatible with both Windows and Mac . The antenna for this model is 2DB . Though the router was easy to set up I had some difficulties in configuring it to my settings . There have been numerous instances when the connection dropped and I had to reset the router for it to function properly . This frequency of loss of connectivity is an unhealthy sign .	-1
It looks cool , has a lot of features , comes with lots of accessories , the batteries last a long time -- this seems like it should be a great player , BUT ... - The radio wo n't tune correctly to stations below 91.0 or so - it just keeps receiving the bottom of *its* range no matter what the station is set to- It wo n't read some audio CD 's that I tried , saying `` no disk '' .- It wo n't read a CD of MP3 's that I burned , replacing the contents of some directories with random ascii chars.- It seems to chop off the last second of some of the MP3's- On one of the MP3 CD 's that I burned , it chopped up about half of the songs into multiple songs , resulting in a blip as it goes from one to another -- i.o.w. , it will list a song three times with playing time for each one a third of the total time- Sometimes while playing MP3 's , it will randomly jump to the middle of another MP3 in another directory	-1
All I have to say is this is the worst player ever ! My MP3 cd player kept on skipping and having a rough time playing cd music . I did n't even bother of keeping it , I just throwed it outside my window into my trash can . There is way too much negative description for this player and it is way too much that I am not going to list them.RioVolt , if you want to try to make a better innovation for the community , then I suggest you to fix up this RioVolt SP350 . Stop ripping off people money and start fixing up this MP3 CD player !	-1
Unfortunately this keyboard did not work with the G4 PowerPC OS X 10.4 . I even went to Macally site and downloaded the drivers for it . Initially the sounds and eject dvd did not work until I installed the driver . After installing the driver the number lock never worked ( before or after the driver was installed ) . Along with the fact that when I typed it started added numbers in between the letters ( odd glitch ) ? so back it goes !	-1
There is no current driver for this keyboard , buyer beware . I contacted the manufacturer and they confirmed this fact . This product is of no use to me whatsoever .	-1
This is a very quiet and effective laptop cooler , while it lasts . I 'm on my third and last one ( it 's the only one I could find in my area ) . None of them have made it past the 5 month mark .	-1
I have gone through three of these coolers . All with the same issues . Either the wire stopped working or one of the fans . It is made very cheaply and isnt meant to last long . It does keep your laptop cool but its durability and reliability are very poor . Go with the antec laptop cooler , excellent unit that has worked great for me for over a year . The antec is built much more durably than the targus so go with that one .	-1
I bought this MP3 player thinking that it would be convenient and also double as a hard disk to move files from home to work and vise versa . Since I have had the machine I have had to completely reformat it over a half dozen times ( within 2 months ) . Currently it is not working at all . This machine has been extremely unreliable . Often I would go on a trip and it would simple not work- one then needs the CD and a computer to reformat the device before it can work again . and , after you reformat it , you have to re-install all the songs you had on there before . When it does work every time you shut it off and restart it you have to go from the beginning to get back to where you were . I thought small size and lack of features would mean hassle free use . Nothing is further from the truth . I am only upset now because I can not find the receipt to return this junk . Please , do yourself a favor and get something else .	-1
The thing is cheaper at the circuit city website . That 's all I have to say about it .	-1
This player is too old and not worth the money . Spend a few more bucks and get a player with Gb 's of storage space and way better audio output .	-1
... I purchased this mouse after reading the many positive reviews . But its performance is very disappointing . It wo n't move the cursor to where I want it to be and it 's very frastrating sometimes . It is lot worse than my old microsoft wheelmouse . This is my second bad experience with optical mouse . The extra functions with this mouse like navigating are nice , but I seldom use them since a lot of browsers now provide mouse gestures that are more convinient than using the mouse .	-1
After reading the glowing reviews I ordered the MX500 eagerly anticipating a performance jump from my year old Microsoft Blue optical mouse . The mouse is attractive and well built . I rather like the & quot ; heft & quot ; some people complain of and the design is comfortable . The problem is performance . The pointer is erractic ( quivering , shaking pointer with & quot ; ghost & quot ; images flashing behind it ) and the software is extremely buggy either from the CD or Logitech 's site ( numerous crashes that ended when I uninstalled the Mouseware drivers ) . Plus the CD installed Backweb Lite to faciltate online registration and updates . Little did I know that that particular program is considered Spyware by many spyware removal programs . That 's really a shock from a company like Logitech . All in all I was very dissapointed with the MX500 . I went back to my old MS Blue optical , downloaded the lastest drivers from Microsoft and it runs rings around the Logitech and is much more stable !	-1
The mouse works great . Installation was a breeze , the mouse functions exactly as I hoped it would . It looks great on my desk.But.The included driver disk tries to install all sorts of garbage along with the MouseWare software . Included on the disk are & quot ; eBay Shortcut & quot ; ( presumably a Browser Helper Object , but I 'm not going to install it to find out ) , Logitech Resource Center ( yay , more stuff in my system tray ! Slow computers are FUN ! ) , Musicmatch ( barf ) , and WildTangent GameChannel . WildTangent is known spyware ! It gets better , though -- if you opt to install the & quot ; Logitech Messenging Center , & quot ; which purports to keep you notified about driver and software updates , it installes Backweb -- an even more insidious piece of spyware than WildTangent ! This is completely unacceptable . If I 'm going to pay this much for a mouse , I should not be expected to then give up even MORE in the form of my privacy.Shame on you , Logitech . I 'd give this mouse 5 stars if it were n't for all the sneaky stuff on your driver disk .	-1
After listening to many speakers back to back while I was sampling what units I would like to try out , I listened to the 161 's . I have to say they were the worst sounding speakers in the place .	-1
After considerable research and pricing I have found this product just what I was in need of . Excellent sound production .	-1
Well , after years of resisting the Bose craze , I finally tasted the koolaid . And never again . Look , I have a large deck and had been using a pair of Yamaha NS-AW350W outdoor speakers powered by a decent 125W Sony receiver . I was very happy with the Yamaha 's , but after several years of hard exposure to the elements , they had served their purpose . So I decided to replace those with the Bose-and I am horribly disappointed . The Bose speakers just sound like mud ! The high and low ends are very lousy , and not even as good as speakers that cost 1/4 the amount of these Bose units . I reconnected the Yamahas briefly to make sure my amp had not hatched a transistor or something , but sure enough , the fault lies in the speakers.The good-I was very happy to see the Bose units were made in Mexico , not China . And the styling is very good , with easy installation . The sound distribution is also quite good , in that there is no single `` sweet spot '' for uniform stereo coverage . Hats off to Bose on the coverage , that is impressive.The bad-Although the speakers were well packaged , one of the wire terminals were broken off right out of the box.The ugly-I was not opposed to spending close to $ 400 for a premium set of speakers . However , when the sound is inferior to speakers costing much less , that is unforgivable.Well , live and learn I guess !	-1
I compared this lens to a Sigma 30mm F1.4 , the Canon 24mm was softer at the same f2.8 stop on both lenses . Neither lens is a great lens with the sun in frame , which I expected with the Sigma , since it is designed for speed . The Canon 24mm is not that fast of a lens at f2.8 , so I thought I would use it as a sunset lens . The lens makes a horrible triangle shaped flare , along with other rainbow patterns . The lens also did poorly with shooting a skyline at night . I was disappointed , maybe stopped down it would look better , but that point your at f4 , 5.6 , 8 , and there are plenty of lenses stopped down that look great . Also manually setting at infinity , wide opened , seemed slightly off the mark , I only shoot manual , since I am a professional and use a loupe to always check focus , but I was also hoping to have a lens I could pull out in a dark moonlit landscape and know for sure where infinity is . Might as well shoot though a lens cap .	-1
While this lens takes pretty good pictures , I ca n't endorse it 's purchase . When I received the lens , it looked like it was in good condition so I installed it on my camera . I quickly realized that autofocus was not working properly . After testing different shots and different conditions , the autofocus would only move every so often , and the camera would not take pictures because the AF was n't working . When AF DID work , it was very slow and sluggish . After awhile , it would n't work at all . I brought it to a local camera store , and they diagnosed it as a bad motor ( all other lenses work on my camera , so it was not the camera ) .The lens worked fine with manual focus and I do n't have any complaints about the picture quality.I 'm not sure if the bad lens motor was due to Canon 's QC or if was due to the infamous subpar packaging of lenses from Amazon . Either way , the lens was defective and was sent back .	-1
Either it was damaged in shipping , or I got a defective lens . For whatever reason , the picture quality on any photo taken on this lens ( with every setting , stop , is on/off , tested ) came out blurry , particularly on the left side . Photos taken with my old stock 18-55 lens were dramatically clearer . The zoom range was decent , but I 'm disappointed . Sending this lens back . It did n't even come with a manual . I was really looking forward to a lens upgrade. -- -Update -I reordered the same lens from the same folks and , surprise , this one came in a real Canon lens box with manual and everything . Clearly the one I sent originally was not brand new . Be advised , if you do n't get a manual and a canon box , you 're getting sent something that someone else returned . That said , the new lens is beautiful . The shots are crisp and even using it for a few pictures , it 's pretty awesome and the best lens I have.If I could , I 'd change my rating from 1 star to 4 . For the hassle I went through returning the bad lens , I have to take away a star .	-1
I bought this lense about 3 years ago and used it very little . I 've used it at Christmas and various vacation trips . It 's by far the worst lense I own . In fact I have several Canon lenses that SUCK ! ! It seems Canon has a problem with quality control . Make as many new models as possible to keep share holders happy . I would rate this minus 5 if I could . Canon want 's $ 204.00 just to look and see if anything is wrong . Plenty , autofocus sucks , pictures blurry no quality control ! ! Yes , I feel better now .	-1
I must have gotten a bad lens based on these reviews but then again maybe they do n't have to look at thousands of images at 100 % in a photo editor . This is the worst lens I 've ever owned . It is soft , soft , soft . Even my cheap 50mm 1.8 is significantly sharper.One reviewer said it 's sharp on all four corners ; not mine . It is embarrassingly fuzzy on the corners at any aperture and the edges as well as the middle too and forget about zone focusing . One of the great things about a lens like this is you can supposedly zone focus so that at .f.8 everything from 5 ft. to infinity is in focus - wrong.For the price this lens is a rip-off . This lens does have a sweet spot but you 'll wait a long time finding it and it 'll happen once in a blue moon . How can an image from a lens shot with a Canon 5D at 1/500 and .f.8 on a sunny day be soft ? Unbelievable . Another reviewer wrote it can be had used for 30 Euros - I do n't doubt it . Whoever buys mine when I upgrade should call the police .	-1
I 've purchased Hoya filters in the past and was very satisfied . I did n't realize until the filter arrived that it was multicoated and had serious reflection problems . Also , the filter had the Hoya name but was made by Tokina . I am familiar with Tokina lenses but did n't realize they had glas making capbilities . Did they buy Hoya filters ? I strongly recommend anyone buying a Hoya polarizing filter buy only one that has the HMC ( Hoya Multicoated ) labeling . Multicoated polaring filters are a must as one of their primary purposes is to reduce reflections .	-1
I purchased this machine a couple of months ago and have never had such lousy service . After loading the machine I hit the `` shuffle '' button and the carousel stopped the shuffling process after the third song . Customer service had me ship the unit to their service center in Laredo , Texas . We received a `` refurbished '' unit back in the mail . What a joke . I reloaded all the disks for the second time and the same thing happened . I heard a crunching sound and the shuffle mode did not work . I had to ship the unit `` again '' to Texas and received the third unit . Same problem . None of the three machines worked and they all have the same problem . I personally do not think the people in the service center even look at the machines . Sony used to be a quality product . They obviously have all this crap made overseas and the work is all inferior . The service is horrible ! ! ! This is an inferior product made by a fifth rate company that no longer cares about its products or customer service . I will no longer purchase anything Sony . It has left a bitter taste in my mouth . Companies like this should not be in business in America . I rate this company and its miserable product a minus 100 .	-1
I 've owned this machine for 3 years and it has now sat in the box for the last two . I have only three complaints:1 . Loading CD is cumbersome into the correct slotPossible answer is to create a thin 'slide ' like extension that can be anchored to the opening and provides a ramp into the slot . I should swing away into discrete depressions in the top.2 . Labeling is a painNot sure how to improve this . But there must be a more automated way like using wireless access to identify songs like on my media center server.3 . It wo n't play some personal burnt CD with my play-lists.I 've tried different type of Cd 's and it 's hit or miss.4 . It scratches the CD it playsIntolerable.My final solution was to create a Jukebox of my own with desktop computer and ripping music directly to it . This solves all four of my issues so I will not be looking for another hardware solution again .	-1
I bought two of these units about a year ago . The audio is amazing for for the small size , it can really fill up the room . I have not tested the AM tuning , but the FM tuner constantly drifts . Every 30 to 40 min you start to hear a bit of distortion in the station . You have to go and bump the frequency up a bit then all is well again . When it does tune into a station the sound is wonderful ( for another 30 min ) . I can tune both of these units along with a digital pll receiver on my stereo to the same station , leave the house for 2 hours and both Tivoli 's have drifted far enough off the signal that you can not tell what is playing on the radio from all the distortion , the digital receiver is still locked in and playing perfectly.For sound for pound , I give this unit 5 stars . However , the tuner section gets a solid 1 . Since this is an AM/FM radio I would think the tuner is important enough to the function to justify a 2 star rating .	-1
The Tivoli Audio Model One is nice looking tuner that performs reasonably well and sounds OK and I could recommend it if it was priced around $ 50- $ 70 . At the current sale price of $ 150+ this tuner is not recommended at all . The construction quality is decent with a very nice wood finish . Tuning is also fairly sensitive , but not more so than any other good table top radio . The sound is simply too bass heavy and not really listenable for talk programs . Pop music sounds alright but classical and jazz are simply too fuzzy due to the bass emphasis.If you can find one second hand for around $ 50 then maybe give it a try . The current unjustifiable cost is due in part to Tivoli 's popularity in novelty shops and high end department stores that sell overpriced gimmicky gadgets .	-1
Would no function with my old MS Ergo Keyboard ! Sent it back . Tried other keyboard laying around and nodda .	-1
After exchanging emails with IOGear for days support , it finally dawned on them that this KMV switch does not work with Windows 7 .	-1
My previous KVM switch could not deliver enough resolution for my new graphics . The IOGEAR worked perfectly for a month until the number 2 mouse port died . Now the fun begins trying to get it replaced .	-1
What a piece of junk . I am tired of having to restart my machine because this thing bonked out because I typed too quickly . Apparently it can not process too many keystrokes.When I type quickly , the Iogear Mini KVM switch apparently gets confused and freezes up and starts `` switching '' the monitor off , then on , then off , then on in 1 second intervals . The keyboard is no longer responsive.The only way to fix it is to turn it off by unhooking everything that can provide electricity to the unit ( all cords to both PCs ) .However , sometimes that does n't fix it , and I have to restart my machine , which means I lose ALL unsaved work.My advice is that , if you work from home , AVOID this at all costs . If you are in the middle of doing anything important and you type one-too-many-keys at the wrong moment , your work is toast .	-1
I 've been a Netgear fan for several years . After trying Belkin and Seagate 802.11b wireless components and signal dropping to poor in the next room , I loved that Netgear components gave me a very good or excellent signal anywhere in the house . So when I got a TIVO I thought I 'd use the Negear FA120 together with my Netgear wireless acccess point . Big mistake . Did n't work on the TIVO at all . To test it , I tried it on my computer . Did n't work there either . Called Netgear tech support , got a pleasant young lady , Chinese I think , whose English was marginal . Spent an hour trying to explain the problem , not sure she ever understood what an English speaker would have understood in two minutes . Finally she gave me a totally false and nonsensical solution . She claimed that the only way to get a wireless signal is to have exactly identical components on both ends , which of course is absurd . I later saw on the TIVO website they have a list of compatible adapters , and the Netgear is n't one of them . My fault for not seeing this first . But this does n't change the fact that the FA120 does n't work and the tech support was a total waste of time . I 'm sending the FA120 back , and my view of Netgear has soured considerably .	-1
I bought the Sony ICF SW7600GR for two reasons : one , because for years it 's been popular among radio enthusiasts ( DXers and SWLers ) , and two , because it probably will not be available for much longer . This is the only shortwave radio Sony presently makes , and it may be the last the company will ever make . I wanted to see what all the hype was about while there was still time.The unit is impressive in its build quality . The body is solid and weighty , and the buttons and switches seem firm and reliable . However , the antenna flops from side to side , which is ridiculous in a radio that has been around for so long . Why would Sony not have fixed such an obvious flaw over the years ? AM and shortwave reception off the whip are good , while FM is only fair . There are a number of features for better tuning in frequencies , such as synchronous detection , gain , and a filter switch . The sync is an interesting feature and can substantially improve the problems of drift and distortion . The key is to try both USB and LSB positions to see which sounds and works best.My main complaints about this radio are the display window , the tuning , and especially the audio . The window is small , poorly lit with an olive green light , and provides minimal information . The absense of a tuning wheel of any type makes skimming through the frequencies inconvenient . Instead , you have to hold down buttons , press them repeatedly , or else , let the scanner cover each meter band , one segment at a time . When the scanner reaches the top of the segment , it then returns to the bottom . In order to get beyond one segment to the next , you have to hold down , not the course tune button , but the fine tune button . And of course , you also have to know the exact frequency the scanner needs to pass in order to reach the next segment . This is a total pain in the neck , and it repeatedly sends me to one of my other SW radios . A tuning wheel would have instantly solved the problem . But my main issue is with the audio quality - thin , cheap , and tinny , like an old transistor radio . The Sony sounds worse than any radio I 've ever owned . Because I keep a radio at my desk and may listen to it for several hours per day , this is a very annoying flaw to me . The tone is much better through a set of headphones - especially on the FM band - but who can stand listening to shortwave for hours through headphones ? A pair of quality computer speakers would solve the problem , but as it is , this radio is not for those who listen to radio for hours on end , and especially , not for music lovers . Even FM sounds poor through the speaker . In my opinion , Sony 's own $ 10 ICF-S10MK2 pocket radio has better audio quality . This is unacceptable for a radio that costs $ 150 or more and gets rave reviews . It 's also a reminder to take user reviews with a grain of salt.The Sony excels as a portable shortwave radio with SSB . This is definitely its strength , and as such , it is worth having , especially if you 'll use the included wire antenna that substantially improves the reception . It also comes with a shortwave manual that offers helpful information , including frequency locations . Clearly , the ICF-7600GR was designed for the shortwave hobbiest , and the whole package makes a nice little shortwave kit - radio with tilting stand on the back , soft case , reel antenna , and two booklets . But beware that the unit does not include a power adapter . It 's batteries or nothing , unless you can find an adapter elsewhere.I placed the Sony ICF-7600GR next to my favorite Sangean ATS 909X radio and compared performances . Regarding sensitivity without the reel antenna , I found the two to be approximately equal . The Sangean actually surpassed the Sony on FM sensitivity and AM selectivity . I was quite disappointed with its selectivity , especially since a local station that I listen to constantly gets terrible interference from another signal ; whereas the Sangean picks it up with no interference at all . And of course , the Sangean has far superior audio quality and , in my opinion , a far more sensible and attractive design , including a tuning wheel . Then again , the 909X costs a whopping $ 225 . Yet , the Sony beats the Sangean whenever the synchronous detection is applicable . That is a very useful feature that alone makes the Sony a respectable AM/SW radio . I add these comments because the two models have been perhaps the most popular portable multi-band radios over the years , so comparing them is only natural . If you could afford only two portable shortwave radios , or wanted to limit yourself to only two , I would say these are definitely the two to have.In the end , the primary description of this radio that comes to mind is , `` mediocre '' . Sorry , ICF-7600GR enthusiasts , but this radio has serious flaws . It is a multi-feature multi-band unit , decent enough for SWLing , but unfortunately having a floppy antenna , poor display window , moderate selectivity , no tuning wheel , and terrible audio quality . In addition , the controls on the sides of the radio are tiny and poorly labeled , so that people with either bad eyesight or fat fingers could have a difficult time using them . I would not have purchased it , except for its reputation ; which is to say , I had expected a substantially better radio.The Sony 's outstanding feature is its synchronous detection , which really does work wonders . It allows the radio to latch on to some frequencies that otherwise would be intolerable , due to interference . But the several serious shortcomings of the Sony make me give it only a two-star rating . [ Note : The price of this radio meanders all over the place , from between $ 120 to close to $ 300 . If you 're going to buy it , then at the very least wait a while until the price nears the lower range . ]	-1
I used to be a Toshiba fanatic , but this is the third disappointing Toshiba product I 've purchased over the past 3 years . I 'm not buying any more.Overall , this is a good DVD player . It plays DVDs , DVD-R , CD-R , CD-RW , JPEG ( pictures ) , and MP3 . However , it will not play MP3s from CD-RW , and there is NO - I repeat , NO - random playback feature for MP3s . Imagine that , folks . Oh , also , you can only put 199 MP3s or JPEGs on a disk ; the player simply wo n't recognize more than that.So , with 5 disc slots , that 's about 1000 songs you can put into this player at once ( on MP3 ) , but you can not play them back in random order . This quite literally defeats the entire purpose of having MP3s to begin with . Do n't even bother converting anything to MP3 , because you 'll never listen to more than a few hours at once , which means that you 'll never hear most of your songs unless you manually start playback at random places.This is simply [ wrong ] .The remote is typical Toshiba fare , which means it looks as if it were designed and built in North Korea.Connectivity is good . Optical digital audio out , digital coax out , component video out , and S-video out are all present.If you never plan to play MP3s , and you have the fingers of an 8-year-old child and do n't mind the remote , then this is a very good DVD player . If you have normal fingers and play MP3s , do n't even think about it . What a disappointment .	-1
Toshiba did a decent job of providing a good DAC for their video and digital audio options for excellent sound . However , it lacks the intelligence that I think should be standard for a device like this . For instance , it does not seem to have continuous play ( or at least I ca n't find a way to enable it ) . When playing CDs , it stops after each disc and you have to manually tell it to play the next one . duh . So , you press the & quot ; Skip Disc & quot ; button on the remote and it goes to the next disc ( somewhat slowly ) and then stops again . duh . You then have to press play to get it to go . Repeat the above after each CD . It 's smart enough to know that it 's a CD and not a DVD , but not smart enough to know that you want it to keep going . The only way I could find around this is to do a Program play and specify each disc . This is a pain to do every time I want to just dump 5 CDs in , press play and have music for ~4 hours . My current CD changer which is 5 years old can do this , why ca n't the SD2805 ? From what I can tell after running it through the ringer for three days , it plays DVDs quite well . However , the purpose of this machine is to be multi-function device and be able to be a CD changer which IMO it fails at . Why else would you have the capability to hold 5 discs and be able to play CDs and MP3s ?	-1
All the other reviewers are in fact correct ; you 'll be lucky enough if 50 % of the package are n't dud CDs . I tried the dud CDs on four total computers , so I know my technology is not at fault . The computers wil spit them back out in the beginning ; deeming them as unwritable ... Or when it is close to 99 % completed , the computer will come up with an error message . Do not waste your TIME and MONEY . It literally took me one hour to burn two CDs because I ended up going through SO many CDs just to get the job done . What a huge frustration and headache . Please listen to the one-star reviews . We are not lying about this joke of a product.And as far as ordering these through Amazon ... The first product I received was in a huge box with little padding ; therefore , the spindle broke and CDs were everywhere . Luckily , Amazon has a wonderful return policy . The next shipment I received was in a smaller box , however , the top clear plastic lid popped off , but since the box matched the item 's size , the CDs were n't detached from the spindle .	-1
It barely works and initial setup was troublesome as the 2 boxes did n't want to talk to each other , I finally figured out that the range on this thing is pretty poor worst then on the RCA RC940 which I finally ended up switching to .	-1
Just got these earbuds . The sound is not rich ... it is tinny and `` thin . '' They occasionally crackle.I 've only been using these for ten minutes but I doubt I will change my mind .	-1
What is with the crazy price on these things ? I have bought a bunch of them , my last order for seven pairs a little over two hears ago . The current price is ***six times*** what I paid on my last order . And it was n't the first time that I had bought them ; in fact , I think I had previously bought them even cheaper from ( or through ) Amazon . It may sound like they are not very durable but that is not the case ; they are fine in durability and excellent in sound . I just have an unusual requirement and go through a lot of them . Plus , they were so cheap , I felt I could keep a drawer-full around like flashlight batteries.And now this crazy price ? I reflexively give them a single star . Actually , that may not be quite fair . Their performance may be competitive with buds in this definitely-not-disposable price range . But I 'd need a very good explanation before I bought them at this price . I think I will scout around a little and see how many stray pairs I have lying around .	-1
I do n't know why anyone rated this anything higher than 3 stars . I buy things on Amazon based on its extremely high rating among its users and buyers , and I was really excited . However , the audio quality of these earphones are seriously bad . Not hissing and popping bad - NO BASS AND ARTIFICIAL SOUNDING bad.I do n't know . If you do n't care about bass in your music , I suppose these will work . I 'm sorely disappointed because my iPod earphones must have spoiled me . I ca n't believe something that came with my iPod works miracles compare to these things .	-1
I found this adapter through a search for Mac Pro-compatible Ethernet cards ; the listing claims Mac compatibility but when the item arrived its PCI interface would n't work with my Mac Pro at all . It 's probably a fine card but it just physically wo n't fit my system . : -/	-1
I think these headphones produce excellent sound . If you are not moving around too much when you use them then I think they are a good choice . However , if you are buying these for workouts I think it would be wise to look elsewhere . The `` bud '' portion of this product is large and heavy compared to the clip so it winds up resting way outside the ear canal and will pretty easily fall out of place . I find myself needing to constantly adjust them while running or at the gym .	-1
These things are completely terrible for me . They do n't stay in the ear , and actualy fall off when I 'm lying on the bench , and the sounds is bad . Stay away	-1
Very difficult to adjust to eye width . Low light performance is very poor . I expected more from Bushnell . Zoom is very difficult to use .	-1
My first impression when I took this camera out of the box was that they forget to put the guts in the cheap plastic shell that holds this thing together . I 've never owned a `` pro '' camera that is so cheaply constructed . It feels like it 's ready to break at any point and will no way hold up to the beating a wedding or other pro work will subject a camera to . It does n't get any better in use . The camera is built on a Nikon F80 , a consumer body , that has been jerry rigged with electronics from Fuji . It features an itsy bitsy viewfinder that 's like looking down a tunnel . The focusing screen does n't have any split viewfinder for manual focusing , which is an absolute requirement for this thing because its autofocus system is pathetic , unreliable and simply does n't work right . Exposure is likewise eratic.With a lot of work and a lot of luck , nice images can be produced . But if you want reliability and consistency , forget this camera.Also , do n't even think about it if you want to shoot handhold below 1/125 . Anything below that , and I get blurred images thanks to the lightweight body and lack of internal dampening . This is the worst body I 've ever owned for camera shake problems . I have the D1H at work and can shoot at 1/15 of second with it and no blur . The Fuji would produce a fuzzy mess at that.Also , do n't even think about using a cheap lens on this thing . It demands great glass . We 're talking ED lenses to get `` pro '' results . It also wants Silent Wave motor focusing on the lenses.In short , buy this camera and you 'll be facing an endless pit in which you 'll toss money for batteries , cards , lenses and backup.Buying this camera made me appreciate my Nikon F4s bodies all the more .	-1
So I am out looking for a PDA for our budding high schooler . Lo and Behold , here is one that { appears } to worth our effort and money . Palm 's PDA latest has the lowest price for new PDAs on the market . We grabbed one and ( after we paid for it of course ) took it home for intense trials.The Zire has a white plastic design frame which I find unappealing . Thinking of all of the Coke spillage or ketchup stains that a typical teenage has on a daily basis . The protective cover is aggravating to say the least . Poorly made , attached and designed . It flips around or slides off to the side and accidentally activates the Zire while in storage . With semi standard dimensions ( 4.4 by 2.9 by 0.6 inches and 3.8 ounces ) , the Zire is no smaller than other Palms . But it does have a lighter weight , since they managed to leave out all of the good stuff.Lets talk Big Brother - Little Brother manufacturing . Today 's market and research communities are striving for smaller , lighter , faster , flashier and less power hungry products . The differences between the Zire and its Palm siblings are atrocious at best.The To Do , Calculator and Note keys have been removed while the Contacts and Calendar buttons have been slid flush against the scroll controls . This appears to offer an easier operation , especially if trying to operate the Zire one handed . There is a customizable Favorites button that can be reassigned ( as can all controls ) through the Preferences menu to allow one to restore a missing button.Since the Zire is equipped with a 16MHz processor and only 2MB of RAM , do not anticipate any blinding speed for performance . Trying to run any applications or even play a game bogs the Zire down . I have seen snails run faster ( you know , like a Commodore VIC20 ) . As compared to some of its competitors , the Zire is half as fast as other Palms , and one sixth the speed of Sony 's Clie line up . The touch screen is easy enough to use , but so is my VCR.With the lack in performance one would think other features would rise and out shine the failure . But nooooooooo ! ! The 2.75 inch screen is monochrome without back lighting . The screen operates nearly as slow as the processor . Visible streaking and blurring as objects move across the display are for kids toys , not PDAs . At least it is as sharp as those of other monochrome Palm models and the resolution has not dropped below 160x160 pixels . Palm has all ways used a high level of contrast with their screens . This makes the screen easy to read , even in dim light . But you still need light ( more than four candles ) .There is a good aspect of the lack luster screen . Since there are no backlight or colors to display ( or drain the battery ) , the battery lasts much longer . The battery lasted over 24 hours before we put in on charge.The Zire comes with Palm OS 4.1and the software CD includes the latest versions of Palm Desktop for the PC and the Mac . Windows users also get Chapura Pocket Mirror for interfacing with Outlook . But do not look for the Documents To Go feature . This has been eliminated , so you can no longer view and edit Word and Excel documents ( much less exchange them between PDA and your PC ) . There are four games included , but do n't expect to get addicted to them , lame was the term my daughter used.The one positive push Palm has with the Zire is getting rid of a proprietary data connector . The Zire uses the increasingly popular USB cable and eliminates the need of a cradle . No more cradle or wires to haul around ( or loose ) . The USB connection recharges the Zire 's batteries . An AC adapter is included for those moments one is not near a computer .	-1
I could not agree more on the issue not brought up here regarding xD memory that this camera is limited to . As if there were not already enough memory formats , yet another one . It seems to be about either desperate , or greedy companies trying to capture customers into their markets forever . Why ca n't we just have one or two formats of memory ? ? This is as bad as it would be to have 5+ formats of CD-RoM drives . And SONY is even more guilty than fuji/olympus.Smartmedia was developed by Toshiba/Fuji/Olympus , and now Fuji/Olympus could n't get along with Toshiba/Panasonic for the sD card . Memeory cards will become more and more versatile into the future and soon be used in countless devices . We need to standardize the market . We ca n't afford to buy special memory for each and every device . If you buy Fuji/0lympus , I sincerely suggest you buy a camera that is not limited to xD such as the C-5050 ( drools over it ) . Together the people can control the market for our own good..	-1
Although I had high hopes that I could carry this cleaning tool with me during my hikes , I 've since decided that it 's almost worthless . The main cleaning `` tip '' is too large to reach the oculars of my Nikon binoculars ( nice going , Nikon ! ) . And although I can use it to clean other lenses ( objectives , camera ) , the results are uneven and unimpressive . As a long term Nikon user , I 'm very disappointed that they 've put their name on a product that 's as mediocre as this one . Surely there 's a better alternative for a compact cleaning kit that I can carry in the field ! I certainly wo n't buy another one of these .	-1
Perhaps I got a defective one , but when I use the brush end on any surface it seems to leave a dark residue . I would assume that there would be just a plain , reasonable quality brush in it but it was n't . I 've used better items .	-1
The first few times I used this , it was great , but I just pulled it out after about a month of not using it , and the spongy pad thing crumbled apart as I tried to use it . When I inspected it with my fingertip , it left black smudges on my skin . The brush end is fine , I guess .	-1
This product works well , until it works . Unfortunately , the felt tip has completely eroded , after about 20 cleanings . And I do n't even have that much hard cleaning to do . Some of the competing products advertise up to 500 cleanings for the felt tip . I did n't see that until now , when I came back in to review this product . Not sure about the veracity of those claims , but 20 cleanings seems very lame , even independently .	-1
Falling apart . I ca n't believe they charge money for this thing . They should n't even give this thing away . They should pay people to take one and throw it in the trash . They should pay people for looking at this thing and skip buying it . They should pay people to forget this thing was ever manufactured . JUNQUE . They should pay me for warning people off of this tube of disillusionment .	-1
I own this product for almost an year . I use only brush of this pen as it is effective in removing any dust from the lens.I stopped using the lens cleaning part because over the period of time , whenever I use it on my lens , it leaves slight black smudges on the lens element which I have to end up cleaning some wet method.I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Amazon was wrong as it said that this would fit my Ford Focus 2005 Zx4 . The site was wrong . When I got it I almost thought it was a joke . It is about an inch too short . If it fits your car it would be nice .	-1
Scrap is not the word i really wish to use , but just to be polite , this is just a non sense product , I tried different combinations to give the product the chance to work.. it Failed to.I connected the output to my camera , then to a recorder , to a RF Transmitter , and not even noise or Humm went out of this piece of scrap.For the price , this is biiiiiggg fail .	-1
This is what I get for trying to economize . This speaker sounded harsh and nasal , like someone talking through a box . I returned it and got screwed on the return shipping . Definitely not recommended .	-1
I had my doubts about & # 34 ; BIC & # 34 ; from the beginning ! Still , against my better judgement , I ordered this POS anyway.If I could get away with it , I would n't give this garbage a single star.This cheap brick blew less than 5-minutes after plugging it in.I got a refund and placed it toward a Cerwin Vega XLS-6C.After all , I need a Center Speaker that actually works . And like everyone else I want crisp dialogue.More importantly for me , I also wanted as much inherent Bass as possible , in order to fully round out the effects of my Sony subwoofer and front speakers . The CV supposedly provides all that and more , but I 'll have to wait and see for myself . As for everyone else concerned , stay away from this no-name junk !	-1
these speakers were shipped by the manufacture or I do n't know who . when I got them the inside had been shook lose from rattling around , bad packing I suppose . I never got to hook them up so do n't know more than this . Returned : there was no problem doing this so your luck may be better than mind if you would like to try these .	-1
I purchased this product with hopes of combining my antenna signal with my analog cable box in order to get local HD channels on a secondary TV without having pay my cable company for another HD box . When I installed the combiner I immediately noticed a degraded signal especially from the cable box . The picture from the cable box signal was especially snowy . I tried several fixes to clean the signal but nothing worked . I removed the combiner and installed a switch and the signal from both sources is much cleaner ( no snow ) -but now I have to get up , walk over to the TV and slide the switch when I want to change from local HD channels to the cable box channels . I did not evaluate the splitting function of this device .	-1
This is a cable only splitter make sure you know that before you buy it . It would not let me see cable and have my ant hooked up at the same time bc of the freq range for it is too small . its ok I use it well on my other tv though just for the ant and another device .	-1
This product from Amazon itself is NOT the Cobra HA-TA antenna , but rather an unlabeled counterfeit of the stock Cobra handheld non-telescopic rubber duck antenna . Upon establishing this , I did not remove it from the package as it will be returned . Build quality appears to be adequate given that & # 8212 ; possibly even made by Cobra 's supplier . I can not be certain that the product is tuned for 27 MHz and will not be testing it . It could be absolutely any antenna in there . Use it at your own risk . Handheld radios out of necessity have to tolerate a bit more SWR variance than the average CB , but if the antenna is completely out of resonance it could cook your CB.Regardless , the primary reason to buy the Cobra HT-TA is to obtain an antenna that exchanges the convenience , size , and relative strength of a rubber duck for the signal strength of a longer antenna . What Amazon is presently selling is n't what you 're getting . Perhaps one of the alternative sellers has the real thing , but as of the end of November 2013 , Amazon.com itself does not .	-1
I bought this on the basis of the top review here , and am sorry I did . The unit pulls so hard it has torn several tapes right off the spools , and seldom opens by itself once the tape is rewound -- the motor keeps hauling away at a fully rewound tape . It often balks at loading cassettes and balks at releasing them ; numerous time I 've had to pry my tapes out of it with a screwdriver . Not once has the cleaning button stayed down , so this feature is as good as absent . I finally put the infernal thing in the garbage , where it belongs .	-1
I might of gotten a bad battery . This thing would not hold a charge at all . Showed it took 100 % , then when used the next morning it was empty . Again it might have just been the batch but this one is no good .	-1
The sound quality is n't that great . They also did n't feel that comfortable on the ear . Sony makes a very similar version and theirs is more comfortable . These feel tight on the ear , almost to the point of pinching . I would n't recommend them .	-1
I found the sound to be sub par . No bass at all . The part that fits in the ear was quite large . Way to big to fit comfortably in my ear . Seems flimsy and not well made .	-1
These must have been sized on a balloon . they did n't fit . They were ugly . They were cheap . waste of good money .	-1
I 've used this radio for a while now , and I 've concluded that it 's not very usable . The problem with it is the tuning dial . It 's tiny ! Everytime I want to tune in a station it takes ages to try to get it tuned properly . If your use is always to tune in one of the 4 or 5 most prominent stations on the dial , then this will work fine . If not , I strongly suggest getting something with a digital tuner . It is n't that much more expensive and will save you endless headaches .	-1
I bought this CD player simply because it was the only one I could find that was not too wide for my entertainment center . Unfortunately , it 's a roll of the dice whether the disc changer will work with the remote or not -- usually not . Also , It 's a roll of the dice whether the player will play a CD or not . I 've had brand new CD 's out of the box not play at all on this player . I 've moved them to another player and they work perfectly . So -- unless you 're really desperate , I 'd pass this CD player by ... .	-1
The base is not the standard size to go on a tripod . It is a smaller bolt size and will not go on a monopod or Sima Tripod . I did not return item due to low cost . Maybe someday I will have a tripod it will fit . The product description did not say not standard thread .	-1
So I have been through two sets of these now ( shame on me ) . First set failed about 15 months after installation , so no warranty support . Did n't even ask , just figured it was a fluke , and bought another set . Second set failed before 12 months but I was not able to contact the vendor about it until it had been over 12 months.I was told no warranty when I contacted TIC . I responded with an unhappy letter and they relented , agreeing to warranty the units if I paid shipping both ways . This was promising , but it was still disappointing to have had two sets fail in around a year . So I spent another $ 35.00 to send the speakers to them for warranty repair or replacement . They came back and said the speakers had been in the ground for two years , and they would not honor the warranty . No explanation of how they came to that conclusion , they just essentially accused me of being a liar , and then had the gall to offer to sell me a new set for a `` discounted price '' that 's still more then they sell for here brand new . Please ... It was a disappointing and insulting experience , buyer beware . If you look here a little bit , you will find similar speakers for a little more money , but come with a limited lifetime warranty . I am two years and $ 195.00 into TIC products , and I have nothing left that works . Unless you want to replace them every year , I suggest you explore other options , I plan to .	-1
well , I 've got those for free since the person who gave them to me had my old Paradigm monitors and let them get wet in the basement ... make long story short . I love music , and music sounds better with good speakers ! when I watch a movie those Bose are not too bad but I have them hooked up to an Onkyo receiver with a 12 '' Paradigm sub and they sound bad ! what a shame . my first and LAST Bose speakers . who ever tell you on those reviews that those speakers are good , does n't know what he/she is talking about and had never listen to a good set.the mids are flat , the highs are pitchy and there is no bass and even with a good sub , they just rewin the music . I listen to a lot of classical and operas and the mids are very important but all that is happening is losing the good vocals . I have enough bass thanks to the sub but those Bose ... comon , give me a break ... buy a low end no name speakers and get more sound . one more thing : you need a lot of power to push them , much more then good speakers do .	-1
If you are looking for something simple that is as easy as most things for Windows XP , look elsewhere . Notice that most of these reviews are from Mac users.On the PC side , there is no 'easy ' install , like is being claimed here . Yes , as a geek , I figured it out , but it was not for the normal people out there . You have to follow instructions ! Worse , the instructions are n't easy to find . You have to know to search for the manual on the disk.No compatible software ! Even though it mentions that it 's 'compatible ' with all the operating systems ( it is ) , the software that comes with it for backups ... . does not work on XP . So , that leaves you with a hard drive that you need to know how to install.If you are looking for something simple , this is NOT it . My low rating is based on installation and setup . I am not knocking it , but want you all to be cautious if you 're not a geek or Mac Addict .	-1
This is my 4th wireless mouse , and the only one that I 've owned that is sufficiently smooth and accurate for gaming . Its also reasonably easy on the batteries . Ergonomically , its great . Just one problem , and its a big one . Sometimes it just stops working . Sometimes re-establishing the connection through the control panel will work , sometimes not . Sometimes reinstalling the drivers will work , sometimes not . Sometimes absolutely nothing can be done to get it to work , but then the next day it will be working fine.If the mouse spirits are kind to you , you 'll love this mouse . If not , you 'll curse it	-1
Just because its a BOSE you tend to think that they sound better . Indeed if you go to a BestBuy store , where there is lot of ambient noise and try these haedphones you perceive it to sound better . But return home and then compare them with other cheaper headphones and you will find that the BOSE is not tremendous after all.I listened with these headphones for 3 weeks and returned them because I eventually found that I got more satisfaction from the cheaper Sennheiser HD 202 headphone for which I had paid only 20 $ at Amazon whereas the BOSE cost me almost 160 $ including taxes.So please do n't go just by brand name . Trust your ears and not your eyes because you are going to listen through your ears and not eyes . Forget the BOSE symbol on your headphone and compare them to any other headphone that you previously own . They will sound as good . Do n't waste your money on this product.The audio is too loud . The treble is too high pitching and almost pains your ears after some time . The bass is reduced , that 's the reason , it does not blur even at high volumes . Overall mediocre sound	-1
I deleted my original , 5-star review . I know this particular model is no longer available , but if my experience is any indication , you should think hard before buying a Toshiba laptop , especially a lower-end model . I had the Satellite 1415-S173 for three years -- during the first year I had it , it blew a hard drive ( thankfully under warranty ) . I had it fixed and less than a week later , it blew another hard drive . This time it went back to Toshiba to be fixed . All was more or less well for the next two years , when a Windows problem shut the thing down completely . I took my data out of it and switched back to a Mac . I am sick of Windows ' unreliability , susceptibility to viruses and other problems , and the masking-tape-and-chewing-gum nature of patching together Windows machines just in order to make them function . BUT -- more to the point , the computer had inherent problems , first and foremost being the cheap desktop processor Toshiba uses ( or used ) in their lower-end laptops . This machine got incredibly hot and I was told this is probably what killed my first 2 hard drives . If you have one of these machines , I highly recommend a cooling platform which is probably the only thing that kept my laptop running for an additional 2 years . It 's a shame , because aside from being very heavy and having a weak battery charge ( 1.5 hours at best ) , this laptop was attractive and easy to use with a nice bright display . But ultimately -- not a good value -- at $ 1,200 I do n't consider it a `` cheap '' machine by any means , and certainly not when compared to my ( less expensive ) iBook .	-1
I own this camera and while it was very good in 2002-2003 the years have passed it by . There are other cameras with more megapixels , faster response time , better battery life , lighter weight , better lens , etc . Plus they cost the same or less than this camera is advertised for here . I still use it because I bought the waterproof case ( up to 100ft depth ! ) and I use that regularly . You can probably find used s230s for way less than the prices here if you really want it .	-1
There is something nasty about the driver for this camera . On 2 different machines , the driver for this camera creates faults at shutdown -- something about not releasing control and being forced to quit by Windows XP . Install at your own peril . NOT recommended .	-1
I bought this along with a new Olympus camera , for all the obvious reasons ( faster downloading ) . I 'm not that enamoured with it.The good : - downloading is definitely faster than from the camera- it 's portable , so I can use it on any of my PC 's or laptops- I did n't have too many issues making it workThe bad- bad driver ; still not XP certified . I 'd expect Olympus to have their act together in this regard- would n't work with my 7-in-1 floppy drive card reader ; I 've had to disable that on my PC to get this to work- does n't like 'moving ' pictures - will only 'copy ' and then I have to manually delete the pictures through file manager or the camera- I think it is slow : plugged into a USB 2.0 and transfer rates are well below par . It takes about 15-20 seconds to download a single SHQ.JPG picture ( about 3.5MB ) I personally would opt for something else ( e.g . a multi reader with XP certified drivers ) before getting this card reader.Happy shoppingJB	-1
I 've only been into astronomy for 2 months now , but even for me this set is a bit too entry level quality wise . However I can see the value of this kit to some users because it does come with so many accessories that could be useful at a really inexpensive price.I already have two luminous eyepieces and opted to get this kit to round out my collection . However the image quality is very poor in comparison to what I already have so I opted not to keep this kit.The 32mm eyepiece did not show any signs that it was low quality , the image was good . However for the higher magnification pieces the image was never as clear as I wanted.The color filters are OK , definitely acceptable for the price.I really liked the case the most , it is well made and has room for other pieces you may have.The price point is very appealing for this product , but I believe the optics of the eyepieces may hold back your telescope from giving you the best image possible .	-1
Bought this kit for a Celestron NextStar 8-inch SC scope . Most of these eyepieces are useless because the Celestron telescopes do n't have the quality optics necessary to take advantage of their power . The most powerful eye piece ( not lens or filter ) would probably only be useful for looking directly at the sun ( it 's soooooo dark ) . I joke , I joke : Do n't look at the sun without the appropriate filter.Using these eyepieces in a Celestron is much like mounting a 24-power Leupold scope on an Uzi : It ai n't gon na do anything for your accuracy .	-1
I thought I 'd get these guys to see what all the hubub was about , but found myself disappointing . I felt silly after buying them because I did n't notice a difference in quality.Pros : It works ? Cons : They are so bulky and thick that my TV mounted on the wall will not angle down enough because they stick out of the back so far . You need a solid few inches of clearance from the plug . This is a problem if you need to have it close to the wall or need to loop them up from the bottom . Big issue for no gain and higher price . This bulk is completely unnecessary .	-1
I 'm thinking this was purchased somewhere else . It was Amazon 's reviews that helped make a decision to buy . Reading through these reviews it looked like heat and/or a poor power supply would result in switch failure . Placing 1 fan below and 1 fan beside kept things cool . A similar but .5 Amp higher power supply was found . My switch failed last night . All 14 computers lost net . Looking it up would tell me exactly when but it has been about 6 months . Yes turning it off and back on will persuade it to function again . Most people would agree that jumping up from what your using internet for to reboot a switch is not acceptable . Netgear 's ProSafe gigabit switches with 5 or 8 ports have worked wonderfully . This one has a problem .	-1
( Disclaimer : I 'm already bitter about Netgear , because I owned a WGT624 wireless router , and the thing would literally die and need to be reset every two weeks . But , I was told , Netgear 's ProSafe products are better , they 're more professional-grade , and they just work . Well , ha . ) I bought this GS105E `` unmanaged plus '' switch a month ago . Let me tell you , as an unmanaged switch , it works . I connected it to my router , and then plugged in my Roku , Xbox , and Blu-Ray player , and viola , they 're connected to my network . So , it does its basic job okay , at least.But I wanted more than that . This thing promises network monitoring , VLANs , and bandwidth control . Supposedly , it can give you that ... IF you 're running an older version of Windows ! Instead of a web-based interface like most modern devices , this thing requires you to use Windows-based software that only works on older versions of Windows . All I have in my home now is Win7 64-bit and Mac OSX , and `` administration software '' is n't available for either of them . ( The Netgear website called `` NETGEAR Product compatibility for Microsoft Windows 7 '' does n't mention this router at all , if that tells you anything . ) While trying to learn how to operate this thing , I learned about other unpleasant quirks it has . Apparently it uses UDP for administration login , and broadcasts your login unencrypted across your entire network . ( If you do n't know why this is bad , then you do n't need a router with `` extra '' features anyway , go buy the cheapest unmanaged router you can find instead . ) That brings me to my conclusion : While this switch works on a basic level , it 's perfect for nobody . If you do n't need extra features and just want an unmanaged switch , get a cheaper-but-better one from someone like Asus or Buffalo . If you DO want a switch with extra management and monitoring features , you should buy one with a web-based interface so you never get screwed on ( lack of ) OS support . Netgear makes one , the GS108T , but it costs more and I 'm not sure I 'll trust Netgear again for a long time anyway .	-1
PERFORMANCEiperf 94-96MB/sec - Source Linux ( Lenny ) , Celeron D 2.0 , Broadcom NetXtreme BCM5754iperf 41-45MB/sec - Source WinXP SP3 , P4 3.2GHz , Intel Pro/1000RELIABILITYOut of 6 Netgear GS line switches , I 've had 2 fail outright and one requires reboots.2 GS108 isolated for iSCSI . One requires a reboot every few months.2 GS108 switches at a different site . One failed such that all of the link lights flash at the same time , network drops each time , completely unusable . Power cycle does n't help . Power it off and unplug it for an hour , and it will work for 20-30 minutes . It took 12 months to fail , but I had swapped it in the middle with the working switch during a facilities move.One GS116 uplinked to a JGS116 and used to feed the back office PCs and laptops failed the same as the one GS108 failure above . This is in a different city than the GS108 . This worked fine for 6 months.One GS105 which works fine after 2 years , but is not left on full-time.One JGS116 ( bigger case , has heat sinks and fans ) works fine for several years.All switches have plenty of ventilation.WARRANTYThe retail versions have a lifetime warranty , but cross-ship is $ 20 . The JGS1xx switches ( with fan ) seem to be much more reliable . Alternatively , for half the cost , I picked up aTRENDnet 8-Port Unmanaged Gigabit GREENnet Standard Switch ( 8 x 10/100/1000Mbps ) . It 's been running solid for 2 years now , as has a 5-port I 'm using elsewhere . These are pretty close to the size of the NetGear , half the cost , and the status LEDs are on the front , with all wires going out the back.While the NetGear has lifetime warranty , that 's quickly negated by shipping costs for replacement . The TrendNet has a 5-year warranty which is pretty decent.SUMMARY : Stay away from these GS models . The GS1xx line seems to have a 50 % failure rate after 6 months of power-on time . For twice the cost , NetGear has a larger , fan-cooled version ( JGS1xx ) . Trendnet has a better product for half the cost .	-1
Connected to Linksys E3000 router . NO GIGABIT connection . wth . works at 100mbps . but it 's for the living room , and maxes out . idea was to have a gigabit link to the computer room . NOT worth the extra $ from a Fast Ethernet switch .	-1
I bought this 1 year ago and slowly one port after another started going dead after about 6 months of use . Now all the ports are dead and the switch seems to be in a continuous reboot mode . This is my first Netgear switch and I am not sure I would buy another .	-1
The unit works fine ; I have n't ever had functional issues with it . It gets quite hot - be sure to use the rubber feet and do n't pack them too tightly . ( There is no fan . ) HOWEVER , Netgear warranty service is now quite bad . One of these units ( two years old ) just died on me . We spent two hours being bounced from one person to another ; our call got dropped three times ( ! ) ; we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in ; and at the very , very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements AND WOULD NOT ISSUE AN RMA UNTIL THEY GOT IT BACK IN STOCK . In other words : just sit around , keep calling back ; we ca n't even send in the dud until they are good and ready.I think next time , I 'll try another vendor.If you do decide to buy this unit , consider buying two . You may not get a bad one replaced in a timely fashion .	-1
No problem setting it up , performance was fine , the case is durable . However , it just up and died after 4 years of use . Maybe that 's par for the course , but it 's the most expensive switch on my network , so I 'm not impressed . I 'm replacing it with a D-Link 8-port gigabit , I already have one of those and it 's still going strong .	-1
I bought one of these and it worked fine . About 2 years in , the switch failed and since I could not have my network down for several weeks while Netgear & # 34 ; solved & # 34 ; this issue , I bought another one and then wrote to Netgear for a credit of some sort , indicating that I could send the defective switch to them and that I would like compensation for the new unit I had to buy . They ( not very promptly ) got back to me and pointed out that they would only repair or replace ( with a reconditioned unit ) the defective switch , not replace it with a new one or a refund for a purchased unit . Remember my premise here ... if the switch goes down , you network is down . So , while you are waiting weeks for shipping and repair/replacement , you are simply out of luck . Too bad.Now I suggest that a warranty of this sort is pretty much useless , so in effect , you really do n't have a warranty at all . If you have a network that you can tolerate being down for weeks , you probably do n't need a network . On top of that , I do n't think that a network switch should fail this quickly - this is rather routine technology that at this point in it 's evolution should be rock stable . So , comparatively short life + useless warranty = one star . Next time , LinkSys .	-1
It 's very simple : if you want a great wireless desktop solution , but do n't give a hoot about Bluetooth connectivity , this is the product for you . If you want to ever connect to anything else via Bluetooth , do n't even think about it.I have done hours of Googling looking for a solution to this problem , but have come up with the same result everywhere I go : the Microsoft BT dongle is virtually useless outside of communicating with the mouse and keyboard ( and maybe a printer ) . It seems that many people have had to buy a BT dongle from a 3rd party and throw away the Microsoft dongle.I feel extremely betrayed by Microsoft 's claims of connectivity with this set-up . I just bought a Sony Ericsson T616 with BT , and ca n't use it with my computer . If you want to connect a phone , do n't buy this product ! ! !	-1
The sound of these headphones has too little treble and too much bass . You feel like you are seated in the bass section of the orchestra and can hardly hear anything but the basses . I much prefer my Sony Fontopia MDR-EX51LP earbuds , which have plenty of bass , but it is not overpowering .	-1
The sound quality is good for headphones of this size and price . The problem I have with them is that the ear-cups do n't rest flat over the ears . The angle of the ear-cups is n't right , so after awhile that part of each ear that receives more of the contact of the ear-cups begins to hurt . I 've never had this problem with headphones before , so I do n't think my head or ears , etc , is anything out of the ordinary . I 've had cans that were too tight on my ears , but I do n't remember the ear-cup angle being the problem . I previously used similar cans -- one from this same manufacturer and another from a different maker ( both of which I wanted to replace with these new units since they the old ones had a lot of miles on them and the sound quality was gone ) , but the ear-cups on both of those units rest perfectly flat on my ears . I put them on again to confirm it . I prematurely ordered two sets of these cans and the ear-cups are the same on both -- resting at an angle as opposed to flat on my ears.I prefer this style of light-weight headphones , but these are uncomfortable because the ear-cups do n't rest flat on my ears , so I have to order something else . The sound quality is good and the volume is better ( louder ) than my older units , but since they become a bit uncomfortable after about an hour or so , well , they 're no good for me	-1
nicely designed , good sound , comfortable , very reasonable price . just what i was looking for . However , the point at which the wire enters the 3.5 mm plug head , repeated bending with seemingly inadequate support led to the early failure of this otherwise good headset .	-1
My elderly Mom purchased this radio perhaps 6 or so years ago from CCrane . It worked well initially , however , about a year or two ago it started to fail on her.The LCD display only 1/2 works and the switches along the top need to be pressed so firmly her arthritic hands ca n't do it anymore.It now sits in the closet gathering dust . She has some cheapo drug store radio by her bedside so she can listen to her AM radio shows at night.Other far cheaper radios and electronic devices have faired much better than this $ 159 has . It was great while it was new but not so great anymore.PS : The TV band does not exist anymore so that feature is useless too on her radio ...	-1
As my other reviews show , I 'm easy enough to get along with and do n't expect the world from cameras , radios , etc . But I do expect them to do something for the price , and this did n't . I bought one from C Crane five or six years ago and had the typical complaints that have been voiced here : Poor AM performance when GREAT was advertised , and the mysterious LCD fade out.We 're talking metro NY here , it could only sporadically pick up WCBS in Parsippany ! ( That sounds like a Seinfeld line , but it 's true ) My $ 5 garage salew bought Thompson ( GE ) did better in Bergen County ) Now , since you 're reading the reviews ( which by the way , I 've never seen so many 1 , 2 , 3 star reviews for ANY product on Amazon ) I will make a recommendation : the Etone E10 , which is what this was supposed to work like and did n't . And save $ 60 , or save $ 90 and get an FR400 , or get that in camaflouge and save $ 120.BUT GET SOMETHING OTHER THAN THIS ! ! ! ! Luckily I lost mine a couple of years ago so it 's not around to annoy me .	-1
CC Radio needs to get their S**t together and produce a radio that isworthy of the cost . Sticky buttons , bad LCD readout , and poor customerservice . Buy something else . Anything else . BL	-1
I bought the for an old 2000 computer . It said the hard drive is new . Apparently , mine was manufactured in April 2002 . I bought it sometime in June 2013 . So you might not get a new hard drive . I used crystal disk info t check the health status . It 's in good condition but it ha about 35000 hours on it . It 's also kind of loud , but it works so I 'm happy with it.Update 7/7/14 : The hard drive gave me the click of death . I expected this to last longer than a year , despite its age . I am now disappointed in this product , and would never recommend it to anyone unless they like dead hard drives .	-1
This product did not work at all and with multiple ethernet cables and computers . I believe all the ports where bad .	-1
Linksys appears to be riding on their reputation . During the 1990s , their stuff was top notch and we bought nothing but Linksys . Then , they were purchased by Cisco , and their quality appears to have nosedived since then.We had the exact same experience as another poster , with indicator lights remaining on after the plugs were pulled from the corresponding sockets , and within a day , the whole unit died.We 've stopped buying Cisco/Linksys and found Netgear products to be what Linksys used to be : well made at attractive prices . I 'd suggest anyone looking to purchase Linksys products look into Netgear instead .	-1
I have never had a huge problem burning music onto cd-r discs till I purchased these Memorex . I am an avid Amazon customer but I did not purchase these from them . I still felt I owed it to all buyers to warn them . Had I bought them from Amazon I would have been able to return them hassle free with the huge problems I encountered . Regretfully I purchased a 100 spindle of these Memorex cd-r discs somewhere else and 20 out of 25 have been unusable and turned into everready coasters . I have a great HP computer with a superb recording drive andd also use Roxio as my main recording source . Over the past 5 years I have used many different brands from name brands to store brands and honestly never had problems other than the rare and random fluke bad cd . But here whenever I go to record my own playlist the cds have a mind of their own and will burn some of the songs but not all . Like everyone else I thought it was me until I realized howe many hours and discs I had gone through . I tried burning through itunes as well as Roxio and I am not a novice . I do know what I am doing.So , does anyone out there want 50 coasters ? I wo n't even attempt using these ridiculously subpar cd-r discs . And as one other reviewer said items such as this really are basically a 1 or 5 star product . If you purchase a 100 spindle pack and have 2-3 discs that may not work that is a 5 star product but if you use over 50 of them and 40 do not work as is my new score at the time of finalizing this review that is in no way anything above a 1 star product . Please be kind to yourself , avoid the hassle and purchase another brand . Last note , I found a cd-r review site that categorized excellent quality , medium quality and bad quality cd-rs and Memorex was on the bad list . And remember , Amazon sells the product but is not responsible for its subpar performance .	-1
Despite the description , this is NOT a touch lamp . There is a switch and it offers only one level of brightness .	-1
I 've had this for a little over 3 years . The first few months when I first purchased the printer it worked fine . I had a Canon printer prior this and I was looking for a printer that will save me money on ink , unlike the HP printers I 've owned . I was proven wrong . This does n't save me anything . The printer head stopped working and I had to replace it . Took me awhile to figure that out , I 've bought inks after ink and it wo n't print anything , it would always come out blurred out and as if it ran out of ink when I just literally installed a new one . You 'd have to replace the printer head for it to work again . Found and bought one on eBay for $ 30 . Ink is n't cheap and it does n't last very long . When it 's working , it works ok but you 'd be better off investing your money on something else that wo n't waste your money on ink and all the trouble of replacing the print head .	-1
Straight-wired usb to psb does n't always work , or works intermittenly . Be sure this is what you 're after before you purchase it.Tried it with various PS-2 keyboards and USB jacks on the computer side ... with limited success.Though it 's only a few dollars , consider that basic USB devices ( like logitech keyboards for example ) , are usually around $ 10.00 in 2010 dollars U.S . Unless you got a special use , might not be worth the hassle .	-1
For the price I suppose I ca n't be too disappointed , but the USB cord seems to intermittently lose it 's connection to my PC . Every so often I have to unplug the adapter then put it back in . Lately I seem to need to do this more often . Besides this I have n't had any issues with the adapter , but I 've only had the adapter for a month or two and at this rate soon it will no longer be worth using with the frustration it causes.Edit , about two months after writing this review , I threw out the cord because it had to be replugged in too frequently to use . All in all , the cords lasted about a third of a year and the issue started immediately after buying them and only got worse .	-1
I have a Kinesis ps/2 contoured keyboard , which is admittedly a little unusual , but another adapter I have works fine . This one does not work at all . At least it 's cheap enough that trying did n't cost much .	-1
Pro : It 's cheap.Cons : It did n't work and was n't fully assembled on arrival . It took 35 days to arrive.Edit : I 'm typing this on the SANOXY USB to PS/2 Adapter . I pried it apart with nothing more than my fingernails . Where the problem was immediately obvious , a wire was not soldered to the fingernail sized circuit board . Pulling out my trusty soldering iron and attaching the needle tip , the board was properly soldered in 5 minutes . Still rating as a 1-star since DIY ( Do It Yourself ) was not in the description .	-1
I bought these hoping I could attach my KVM switch to some new HP servers . The servers just do n't see them . I have no idea if they will work on anything else but Server 2008 R2 does n't recognize them .	-1
Routinely looses major parts of the signal -- like color . Picture looks like black and white with green tint . Power off and on and it is fine for a few minutes . Full of odd user interface hangs . Press a key not anticiptaed in the current menu and you have to power off to get it back . Typical of my experience with Samsung products -- poor software engineering .	-1
Got a pack of 50 of these to burn playlists for X-Mas gifts thinking Sony would be better than the Staples or Memorex brands , which I did not recognize . WOW , did I ever go wrong . These made a racket in my CD burner before ejecting . Eventually , some worked , most didn't.Returning these tomorrow .	-1
I bought the exact same spindle at office depot , for only 5 dollars ( I now know why they were so cheap ) . I have a 32x burner and tried to burn several at that speed ( the cd 's are supposed to be 48x compatible ) none of them were readable . I had to burn at 4x for any of the cd 's to work ! I would suggest instead buying Memorex , I 've found spindles of 50 cd 's for $ 10 in some stores , and I 've never had a single bad cd . I 'm surprised by the quality of Sony 's cds especially since I 've read elsewhere that they are supposed high quality .	-1
I tried these with V-MODA Crossfades . The sound from these was clearly not as good as the crossfades . However , I did love the long cord and the padded top headpiece . However , the ear pieces ended up putting pressure around my jawline , and after about 30 minutes it was really starting to hurt .	-1
I bought these because I had tried several other headphones , one costing $ 1500 and could not find a pair that offered good sound and was comfortable . These were inexpensive and the reviews were decent so I figured , what did I have to lose by trying them . The answer to that question is , shipping to and from Amazon.I can not recommend them , even for $ 45.00 .	-1
I bought this lens for portraits etc ... It brings a lot of light and takes nice shots . It does have some trouble focusing and is kind of `` loud '' focusing . My main issue is the build . This lens got stuck on my Canon T2i . I had to really force it off , and broke off the plastic back on the lens . Over the next few hours of picture taking , my camera starting giving me the ER1 error more and more . It turns out the lens broke a contact point on my camera body and shoved it back into my camera . Fortunately a local camera shop was able to fix it for very , very cheap and only 1/2 hour of time . For the price , it is still a decent deal . Just be careful taking it on and off . I got lucky .	-1
After selling the old one a few years back ( along with all my old gear ) , I knew I had to buy it again . This piece of plastic just came in , and from testing it I can tell it 's definitely not as good as the older model ! It was redesigned with much cheaper materials , but the product link is the same as the original 50mm 1.8 ; be warned : all those beautiful photos you see that customers posted -- anything from probably 2010 and older -- are from the OLD lens.Changes : -all-plastic construction -- used to be heavier , most likely metal-slower/noisier autofocus-resulting images are not as crisp , despite same settingsIf you are broke and want a decent lens to toy around with , this will always be a great value , and I will always recommend it for beginners . My complaint , however , lies in the fact that this product was `` updated '' to something of inferior quality and make , without any transparency in the process.Had this been my first time with the lens , I would have given it a 4-star `` great value '' review . Since I once had the pleasure of using the older version of this lens , I notice a clear difference in quality . Moral of the story ? Companies will do ANYTHING to make cheaper products without informing the public -- hold on to all your old gear , because it 'll all be replaced with plastic without your knowledge !	-1
I was very disappointed by this product . First off , the photo shows `` Nikon '' in yellow stitching . The product I received had `` Nikon '' in white in what looked like a fuzzy sticker . The strap is too short to be usable . I do not know why it is listed as a `` wide strap '' because it is no wider than the strap that comes with most Nikon DSLR 's . In fact the default strap that comes with Nikon Cameras , is much better quality than this one . SAD . I bought this to be an upgrade , not a downgrade . Being so cheap I 'm not too upset , but it is still a waste . Do n't buy this .	-1
Someone previously pointed out that these earphones did not filter out the highs well . It may be the highs all I know is the only thing it seems to filter well is my wife and kids voices and allow in every other ambiant noise around.Now I may have gotten a lemon but the sound is poor . Volume cranked to high on any device I put this on comes out low at best . Put in any other set of earphones and it is painfully loud.The little inline triangle that has the on/off switch is cumbersome and is at a strange distance from the earphones . Just seems to far from the earphones or not far enough . Just does n't seem to clip naturally anywhere . Either to much cord or not enough.I am not a music or sound expert by any means so it does not bode well that I think these earphones are poor at best .	-1
The design of these should be fine but it 's not . They are light weight but often become itchy and uncomfortable .	-1
These headphones sound great and at first fitting feel very secure . However , once you start running and bouncing , they will practically fall off your head and dangle from your ear . I 'm not sure what non-slip means . Anyway , if you are looking for comfortable headphones that sound pretty good and you are n't planning to run with them , go for it .	-1
The sound is clear but the pitch is way to high , almost squeaky . It is well made and will survive a noisy gym environment but it is not much use anywhere else .	-1
These did n't really stay in my ears that well . They were also quite cheaply made and the left one broke and would n't produce sound after a 6 months to a year . These headphones are quite an old model though , so I 'm sure you 'd be better off buying a newer model of Sony ear buds if you 're interested in them . I use & # 34 ; iLuv & # 34 ; now and they have been thus far my favorite pair of I 've ever owned .	-1
I bought these because of the over ear design . They were cheap so i gave it a shot . The sound quality is horrible . Cheap earphones will sound like cheap earphones . There 's also slight hiss coming from the earphones even when the music is paused . Do n't waste your money on this .	-1
I ca n't get earbuds to stay in my ears , so a few years ago I got some over the ear headphones that sit in your ear like earbuds-style . I really liked them , but so did my dog as it turned out , and she chewed them into tiny pieces.Since I knew that I like the style and fit , I thought I would be quite happy with the Sony MDR-J10 as a replacement pair . I do n't really care about bass or midrange or treble or anything like that while I 'm working out , so $ 10 is the right price range for me . When I plugged them in to my ipod , though , I found that there was something wrong . Even a slight movement of the wire where it connects to the plug causes static and interference . No protective case in the way holding the plug out or anything like that . I figured it was the one lemon in the bunch.I know Amazon has a great return policy , so I sent them back and got a replacement pair of the the same model . Exact same problem . It would n't be much of an issue with stereo-type headphones that are n't going to get jostled too much , but for active headphones ? That 's a dealbreaker .	-1
Bought a pair of these earlier tonight in Best Buy for a few bucks more than listed here . Sadly , it still was n't worth the price ! First off , the fit is good . They stay on your ear really well . Having said that ... The sound is AWFUL ! ! ! Really awful ! Do not buy these unless you want to waste money on shipping them back.For what you spent on an iPod or MP3 or whatever ... spend a little more & get better .	-1
Sound is poor at best , and they do n't stay up in your ear , as a gym rat who wears a head band it it both disappointing but fixable with a head band .	-1
This little infrared remote must be used in front of the camera . So , its most useful function is taking portraits of yourself . Hardly worth the effort .	-1
This remote has no indicator to let you know if it 's transmitting to the camera . I expected more from a nikon product , like a light indicator or a vibrate etc . You just have to hold still to see if the picture is going to take . Also , it does not work well if obsticles are in the way of it . I was only a few ft away & was slightly behind a column & it would not take the picture . I do n't want the wu-1 connector b/c I like to use a discrete remote when I 'm taking pictures of my husband & me . I do n't know what I 'm going to do about a remote ...	-1
When I received this item I expected the battery that came with it to work . It was dead . Have no idea how to get hold of the supplier to deal with this problem .	-1
It is not working , i 've tried changing the batteries but nothing , zippo . Made in China .	-1
I have tried a lot of different things and am unable to get the product to work . There were no instructions . Maybe there 's a setting I do n't know about ? I put the camera on manual or auto , with or without the rubbver protective casing , and it does n't work at all . I have a Tamron lens . I do n't know where the pickup is for the remote or whether you have to be in front of the camera to trigger it . None of the reviews I saw on Amazon addresses my challenge .	-1
Just has too much noise . Anything I hook up has a buzz sound to it . Would send it back , but just not worth the hassle .	-1
Thin wiring and breaks easy . That is if you do n't receive it already broken . I do n't recommend it . I recommended buying one with a thicker cable .	-1
This cable failed almost immediately . You have to wiggle and balance it in order for it to work properly . Lots of static and L & R both stop working intermittently.I do not recommend this product .	-1
I attached it to a microphone , and the cable worked well for a while . After 4 months , it just died . Shame really ...	-1
wasted .06 cents with this purchase , sound cut out if you even touch the cable the very first time i plugged it in , its six cents for a reason , stay away from this	-1
again i have to say DO NOT BUY WIRES OF ANY KIND FROM AMAZON ! I have no clue wtf it is but so far NO WIRE/S HAVE YET TO WORK .	-1
It picks up lots of RF noise.In the digital age where a cable either works or it does n't , it 's easy to forget that analog cables are different . Cheap analog cables sound bad . This one sounds awful .	-1
this cable has terrible sound quality . The sound is garbled and staticy and the cord has to be adjusted to even hear any bass . Contacted the seller and was refunded .	-1
I 'm a video professional . . . my normal brand was unavailable and Panasonic has a good name in the industry . Not anymore when it comes to media , in my opinion.I 've had nothing but problems with my batch of 25 tapes.I 'm experiencing a strange lack of recognition of the timecode , like i 've never seen . . . not just dropped frames . It 's Bad ! Ya know . . . if you have an anomalous batch in your production , if it does n't meet your quality specs . . . do n't sell them to a discounter or something like that . . . just throw them out , will ya please ! I do n't have time for this crap . Guess i should n't be buying one of the cheapest tapes out there , but i 've had great success with TDK cheap tapes .	-1
The Axim has a bug that even Dell customer support will grudgingly confirm . Sometimes the unit will stay on after you power it off and slowly drain down the battery . After a few times of this , the reserve battery drains as well , and POOF ! no more data.happens to me on my Axim . No software fix yet .	-1
I have had good luck with off-brand camera batteries in the past so I was confident when I purchased this one as a second battery for my Canon G9 . Unfortunately , I have just returned it . When placed in the charger , the charge light would illuminate but , instead of turning green when the charge is complete , the light would just go out . When I tried the battery in the camera - nothing . Would not power up at all . The camera and charger work fine with my original battery , so it 's definitely this off-brand battery that 's the problem . I wo n't order another Digital Concepts battery .	-1
I bought a pack of these based on the high-ish review of them . When I received them , I realized that a lot of people do n't have an idea of what a really GOOD screen protector should be like . Yes , these are adequate for minor abrasions and scuffs , however , they are much too thin and rigid to be good for a long period of time . As other reviewers have said , these scratch easily ( more easily than your LCD would without them ) . While I was pressing out small bubbles with the edge of a coin , I noticed that it was leaving scratches on the protector . The screen protector from another company on my other camera is significantly thicker and feels more fluid than these ones . This made it easier to remove bubbles and while you could create a `` scratch '' in it by pressing your fingernail hard into it , the `` scratch '' would heal itself and be invisible about 30 seconds later . I have had this protector on the camera for almost two years now and it still looks as clear as the day I put it on even through moderate use . I have NO expectation that these screen protectors will last even 1/4th that long as look as good as they do at application .	-1
I had used some previous Trendnet spoolers in the past , primarily the USB Print Servers , and found them very easy to use and configure . We had a similar style ( maybe identical hardware inside , actually ) D-Link that failed , and I ordered this to replace it . What I found was that instead of using RAW/9100 standard for Generic Servers , it used an LPR with Spool Designation configuration , which was unnecessary on a single port server like this . Regardless , I am returning the product because no matter the configuration method -- manual or using their wizard -- the printer ALWAYS prints garbage characters . We verified the printer was working correctly through cable-printing , and used another older-styled and larger HP spooler to test , and everything is solid . Their website does not contain firmware or support for this v3.0 version of the hardware either , or even acknowledgement that revision exists .	-1
I spent a few hours of my Saturday trying to set this thing up but I had no luck ... If I get it going I will update my review .	-1
Installation of the driver was easy , however this converter did not work for my application and my computer is unable to recognize the device I am connecting to this coverter .	-1
Every one of these I have purchased no matter the brand has gone south after about a year . I keep buying them because I have a split keyboard and mouse pad that only have ps2 connectors . Can not buy USB models so I am stuck purchasing this adaptor . Ugh .	-1
So I was hoping this would work with my Mac , and it has a very bare bones functionality . It can transfer data , but it is extremely slow and the installation instructions say that it is only compatible with OS X 10.4 - 10.6 , which would have been nice to know BEFORE purchasing . If you are looking for a cheap alternative to the Apple version , this is NOT it for newer Macbooks . Plus , the TRENDnet site does n't have the Mac driver on the site , so you are forced to use an external optical drive to use the in box CD .	-1
I made the following mistake : I read reviews and compared good and bad ones ( number-wise and specifically ) . When I got the USB to PS/2 converter I tried it in several configurations ( different machines and keyboards ) . Worked intermittently , maybe 10 % of time . Thought maybe I got a bum device . When I re-read the reviews I realized the high rating reviews were almost all for a different device , mainly the USB TO RS232 converter . Amazon just jumbles them all together since they are selectable on the same page . Mostly bad reviews for USB-PS2 version . Bummer ! The short part is , this fails to respond almost all the time . Computer sees the converter in `` Hardware Devices '' , but does not respond . I advise you not to buy this in the USB-PS2 version . Not worth even paying to send it back .	-1
Seemed to drop traffic when attempting to program my scanner , resulting in timeout errors . Look for an adapter with an FTDI chipset instead .	-1
I am going return this item . It on occasion will repeat keystrokes from the keyboard . This just irritating when typing a document but the other day I hit the delete key to erase an email and it chose at that time to repeat and started deleting all my other email . I ended up having to recover over 20 emails that the repeating key had deleted before I got it to stop ( by madly depressing the offending key ) Amazon is pretty good and sent me a replacement but as it turns out it was n't that the first one I purchased was bad , there is a flaw in the device design itself . After reading other low reviews I learned that this has been a problem in the past .	-1
These batteries work great . They last a long time , hold their charge well , and they supposedly can be recharged a thousand times . But there are two things I do n't like.First , just like all rechargeable NiMH rechargeables , they only supply 1.2V . Most electronics will work fine with a slightly lower voltage , but devices which require more than 2 batteries can have more trouble . For example , my thermostat at home requires 3 AA cells , and actually does require closer to 4.5V ( what you 'd get from three 1.5V alkalines ) . The 3.6V from a trio of 1.2V NiMH cells just does n't cut it , so I still have to buy alkalines for the thermostat.The second problem with these batteries is specific to Duracell-brand rechargeables . I get that `` the copper top '' is their trademark , but unfortunately the big ribbon of green around an otherwise normal-looking Duracell AA is n't enough to catch the attention of a casual user . We 've had a couple sets thrown away by employees or friends who did n't realize the cells were rechargeable . I think the labeling should be made much clearer . The label needs to be completely redone to make these look like they 're obviously not your normal Duracell alkaline AA cells . Perhaps the whole label should be copper , or the black should be replaced with another color and the word `` rechargeable '' should be even bigger than `` Duracell . '' Purely because of this confusion , I probably wo n't buy any more Duracell-brand rechargeables , because I ca n't afford to have them mistakenly thrown out at a cost of about $ 2.50 per cell . Other brands ' rechargeables , such as eneloop and Energizer , look much different from typical alkalines and are less likely to be mistakenly thrown out .	-1
I 've owned this radio for less than a year and in that year I have replaced the batteries twice , now the radio wo n't play unless I jump start it plugged in , after that it will work several hours unplugged but whenever I turn it off I again have to jump start it.While removing the battery one of the two fragile screws snapped off.Another problem is terrible reception , mostly static.I called Tivoli and was told they will repair it for $ 50.00.So you can make up your own mind whether this expensive radio is really worth it or not.I registered it immediately after I recieved it and Tivoli will not fix it without a receipt , Does anyone keep a receipt that long ? Total cost $ 200 for the radio , over $ 50.00 for batteries , and now another $ 50.00 for repairs plus the shipping charges.I have only taken it out of my house one time and the rest of the time it stays on my desk plugged in.I personally will never buy another Tivoli product .	-1
We got one of these some years ago for about $ 130 , and though that seemed a bit steep , this has been a swell little radio : easy to carry around the house , goes a long time on a charge , sounds good for its size.But $ 220 ? ? ? What changed to make it cost $ 90 more ? So 5 stars for performance , but 2 stars due to plain greed on the part of the manufacturer .	-1
I 've had one of these for probably 5 years now ( the original PAL , not the iPal ) . While the device is supposed to be weather resistant , I found that after about 18 months the tuning knob became very `` dirty '' and staticy when tuning . I think this is due to moisture getting into the case . We keep the Pal on a shelf in the bathroom , and I suspect the steam from the shower did this.But the serious problem is something I 've just noticed recently . The rubbery material the case is made out of has started to deteriorate . The rubber case material has gotten almost sticky and ca n't be cleaned . And if you make the mistake of trying to clean it with Windex , the material almost melts.So you 're left with this device that 's totally absorbing all the dirt that comes in contact with it , and ca n't be cleaned . Even just a damp rag makes the rubber case sticky now , leaving marks in it and not getting the dirt off.I 've seen other rubber things break down this way- usually it 's the little rubber feet on older components , or certain cables.And while the Tivoli still works now , it 's kind of gross looking and worse is kind of strange to touch because of the permanent stickiness.This is an expensive radio , and I just think it should have lasted longer than it did.My only other operational complaint is that there is no `` AUX ' input switch on the front panel ... you have to plug and unplug the jack from the back , which makes switching from radio to Ipod a hassle .	-1
I have the WRT 54g v8 . Router . Every so often , it drops the connection . It becomes useless until you reboot it . I was surfing yesterday , using my Pocket PC . Everything was fine . I tried a couple of hours later and I got the message Invalid Key . I went to my wired computer and I could not get online . I used the Easylink advisor and it showed that it could not find the SSID or the key or anything . So I had to reboot . This has happened twice so far . I did not spend as much time trouble shooting this time because I had seen it before . It looks like it will stay up for about a week before I have to reboot . I can live with it but I expected better .	-1
the version 5 is junk ive been disconnected 2times a day and i have there newest firmware ... for the love of god i downloaded 5 updates on firmware and the only thing its cahnged are the slow dwnlaod speeds NOTHING ELSE it still disconnets	-1
I tried 2 of this one . Followed all the setup procedures but can not detect my DSL internet ( Verizon ) . The ones I got is version 8.2 . I will try the WRT54GL since it has great reviews .	-1
First off , the router works fine for normal consumer use . It was easy to install and was as simple as any other Linksys product I have purchased and setup ( I have owned the BEFW11S4 for nearly 4 years , I have version 1 ) . The range and speed are great.HOWEVER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! If you wish to use this router with static IP addresses ( or static PPOE ) it is impossible . There are forums after forums complaining about the same thing I will tell you below.I recently bought a Dell PowerEdge 2850 for an online music lyrics website I am starting and purchased the WRT54G as well . The BEFW11S4 simply does n't offer any type of UPNP setup which is required for remote assistance.Shortly after setting up the WRT54G I realized that there are no adjustable WAN settings . Supposedly it `` automatically '' configures to your WAN . Well that is probably all hunky dorey if you are a normal consumer however when you are trying to set a specific IP address for the WRT54G to use to connect to the internet , it creates a problem.Furthermore , the router is not user friendly regarding the opening of ports that are necessary for setting up a web server ( i.e . port 80 for HTTP , Port 21 for FTP , Port 3389 for Remote Assistance , etc. ) . It allows you to DMZ however doing that simply opens up an entire can of security worms that no one wants to mess with.So what do I recommend instead ? The D-Link DI-624 router . Why ? Because not only does it allow you to manually set just about anything you can think of , it even gives examples of how to setup a web server and which set of settings you will need to do so . It is EXTREMELY easy . Do n't worry it also offers the `` Wizard '' to help the normal consumer.I was a very very very loyal Linksys fan , but this D-Link has me changing my mind.Hope the review was helpful for all you folks trying to setup your own site .	-1
I upgraded my Linksys 802.11b ( which always worked fine ) to this `` g '' model for the improved speed . I have been disappointed with its performance . Initially , I noticed it was SLOWER than my old router . After reading reviews on the internet ( which I should have done before I bought it ) I learned of many complaints about version 5 . I hurried to my office and flipped over the router and there it was , v.5 on the bottom . Reading on , I learned about the firmware updates so I downloaded them which helped improve the speed a bit . Now , the problem is streaming video . With my old router , I used to be able to watch movie trailers and other streaming feeds . This v.5 stutters and locks up the video . If I ca n't resolve this problem I will likely find another router .	-1
UPDATE- I emailed amazon to let them know about this router since their supplier may be giving them second run products and they have offered to allow a return of this and refund my money . So Amazon does stand behind their products ! I bought this router and for unforseen reasons I was unable to install it until this past week , the dumb thing is defaulted to spanish and will not revert to english ! I spent almost 2 hours on the phone to linksys and they could not do anything with it . After almost an hour I asked for the supervisor and even he could not get the router to english . They offered to send me a newer version but placed a hold on my credit card of $ 79 ! To make matters worse the new one would not even connect to the internet . I contacted tech support but I refused to spend another 2 hours on the phone so I sent it back and will be calling them to remove the hold on my card.I kept the spanish one only until I can find something to replace it other than linksys , it at least connects to the internet but I ca n't secure it since I ca n't read or speak spanish ! At least I do n't live where many could have any access to it.Why would amazon even sell one that is in only spanish ! ?	-1
If you enjoyed computing in the days of the Commodore 64 , and hey , who did n't , then this is the router for you ! First the boring stuff : the router is acceptable in terms of performance , though in an older house you 'll have trouble getting a signal twenty-five feet away because of the thicker walls.The real fun comes in setting up , or in my case re-setting up the modem . Let the adventures in user friendliness begin ! Check out this link for a preview of what you have in store : [ ... ] None of this graphical user interface nonsense for Linksys , we 're back in the glory days of eight hour installs ( Pool of Radiance , anyone ? ) , physical copy protection and `` press play on tape '' if you forgot to tell the computer that your program was on the floppy drive not teh tape player.Searching for the Router takes a full minute . The thing is directly connected to the computer and it takes a minute to find . `` Make sure the internet light is blinking '' , great strategy , thanks Napoleon ! Linksys has a great way of helping you when your router can not find the internet , you just chat online with one of their techs . I 'll let you know how that turns out . I am 36th in line after a mere 15 minute wait.Go ahead , buy this router , everyone else does . But if you get it working , never ever touch anything ever again . Ever . Unless you want to experience the 1980s again . Excuse me while I press `` play on tape '' .	-1
OK for first week or so . Afterwards needed to reboot several times a day as the wired connection to my WAN would lock up . Really frustrated the non-technical family members as they could never figure out why `` email was down again '' . Additionally the computers on my network would periodically not recognize each other , corrected by rebooting the router . This was with the latest Linksys firmware update.I went back to my old Motorola BR700 which , to my knowledge , never exhibited instability in the 3 years I owned it.Thanks Amazon for taking it back . It was replaced by a ZyXEL X-550 router - so far so good.Followup 11/24/06 : The ZyXEL X-550 continues to be a champ . Has n't had to be rebooted yet due to connection issues . Unobtrusive , works well .	-1
I set the wireless router up according to the instructions in order to add a notebook computer to my AOL account . Worked like a champ for about 48 hours . Then , certain web sites would no longer load on my desktop that is connected to the router via ethernet cable ( particularly web sites that require a log in ) . After another 48 hours or so , I could not access the web at all . I had to reboot the router and reload the software , and the whole process repeated itself . I have no idea what the problem is .	-1
After two members of my family received computers for graduation presents , it quickly became clear that wireless Internet access would be needed in order to suit everyone 's needs . Not being a tech guy myself , I did a bit of online research about wireless Internet routers and purchased this one , as it seemed to be the most commonly used . A few days after receiving this Linksys product , I severely regretted that decision for a number of reasons.First , the installation software did not even work as it should have , taking multiple tries in order to set up a home network.Second , once the network was established , it would suddenly disconnect for no apparent reason , requiring a resetting of both the router and cable modem in order to get the system up and running again . I had the router for roughly two weeks and did not have a day in which a connection lasted 24 hours at a pop.I would steer clear of anyone wanting to buy this wireless router . After my bevy of difficulties with this product , I returned it and bought a D-Link product that has worked like a charm with no problems.Perhaps the more tech-savvy people among us have been able to figure out what ails the dropped-signal problem of this product ( as described in other Amazon reviews ) , but for those who do not want to be overwhelmed with techno-jargon , steer clear of this product .	-1
This thing is JUNK ! ! ! Do n't waste your money . I am a computer professional and I had it working for about 5 minutes , then after powering it down and back up it never did work again ! If you buy one , go through the setup and if it does n't work immediately SEND IT RIGHT BACK TO AMAZON ! Do n't waste your precious time trying to get a $ 70 brick to do wireless because the odds are that you will just be wasting your time.Finally , Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged . However , YOU SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO THE BAD REVIEWS THAN THE GOOD ONES . If the product is in fact good it wo n't have many bad reviews , or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional . However , look up all the bad reviews for this product . They should tell you that something is seriously wrong with this product .	-1
Though it is listed for use in ME , I am not able to get a connection , even 16 '' away from the signal.I wanted to add wifi to the laptop I carry on trips instead of the small screen on the phone . Even downloading from Cisco did n't help . It always hangs at aquire . Could be the laptop , could be there is n't any service for older OS 's hard to say . Do n't need the card with newer laptops , because they already have wireless connectivity installed.The seller I got it from packed it very well & it got here from across the country fastest of all the products i ordered that day .	-1
This card was purchased because I had a coupon making this what I thought was a very good deal . I was wrong.I 've installed a lot of wireless cards and this one was just terrible . I followed their directions to the letter and it just kept telling me that it had associated with the AP but could n't find the network or the Internet . OK , I finally used the profile page to enter all the settings manually ( IP , DNS , Gateway , you get the idea ) and it connected immediately . However , I should n't have had to do that.It turns out that the IP address the card was trying to use did n't come from my router . I have no idea where it was getting it ( nearby unsecured linksys router ? ) Once configured , the card has a tough time holding a solid network connection at what I deem a reasonable distance.IMO there are better cards out there .	-1
While the model I bought is similar to this one ( CK1005 ) it is doing the same exact thing everyone else reports . I tried charging all my rechargable batteries a couple of times with this charger and NONE of them work in my digital camera ! At first I thought it was my camera until I put two ordinary AA batteries in it and it worked fine ! What a waste of money . I 'm buying a better more reliable brand . Thanks everyone for your reviews , otherwise I would n't have known what was going on !	-1
I bought my first hard drive and it worked great for 2 weeks until it crashed . Clicking sounds were loud and a dead giveaway that the needle touched the disk . Maxtor sent me another one ... worked for another 1 month and 1/2 ... Same thing . Maxtor will find any excuses for the crash and of course I am to be blamed , after reading several reviews all over the web , it seems that too many people have this issue . Stay away from it ! ! !	-1
Drive was slow to open , and got the `` click of death '' after 13 months . Maxtor only warrenties for 6 months . Seems they know something you should know !	-1
I would not even give it one star but that is the lowest score possible . This is the second Maxtor drive that failed after just over a year ( you think that I would have learned by now . ) After crashing a couple of times already , the drive seems to be heading to the death zone after the latest crash . Of course , as another reviewer noted , the waranty is shorter than the short life of this drive.This may appear to be a bargain but it does not last so it is very expensive in the long run.I would not use a Maxtor drive even if it was given to me free bacause it is not worth the time I spend on recovery every time it crashes not to mention the unrecoverable data between backups.Never again Maxtor .	-1
I wasted two weeks trying to use this as directed , along with the DWL-G650 wireless CardBus ( PC-card for laptops ) . I selected the WPA-PSK encryption format for security and found that it worked from 5 minutes to 2 hours at a time . Same thing with the old and fairly INsecure WEP encryption format . I emailed and phone D-Link 's tech support line and got responses that did nothing to help in any way . I spent weeks researching and reading ratings penned by numerous others to choose what should have been the best wireless networking gear for my environs only to find D-Link 's products a miserable failure , backed up by mediocre , faltering tech support .	-1
This is a great router for the most part as the other reviews will tell you , but it has one big flaw : It ca n't coexist with 2.4GHz cordless phones . As soon as me or my neighbor pick up the phone , its dead . Cycle the power and click repair on the network connections . Extremely annoying as I went through two of these before I realized this was the problem . Unless you are sure no one in your area has a 2.4GHz device , avoid this router .	-1
It started out great , no probs with connectivity . Then I updated the driver . After that if I left the PC on overnight , the next morning there would be a BSOD . Sometimes even after a couple of hours you would get one too , eventually I got tired of it and took the card out . I 've swithced to using cable now , had it out for over 6 months now and I do n't think I 'm going to put it back .	-1
I purchased it to be used with a new phone , but I had problems with the new phone . The initial feedback was it did not sound good . Kept it anyway ( should have returned ) and I will try it again once I replace the phone .	-1
This broke in no time . It seemed like a great product for a few weeks but its not something that can handle a lot of use .	-1
I had one that was still working , but thought it time for another one for a back up as I use it a lot , upon receiving it , I called my friend in Fl and said Hi , what do you think , she said huh ? I ca n't hardly hear you , I checked to make sure it was turned on , than checked volume and yes it was up , so I moved it all the way down and then all the way back up and still had to speak very load to be heard , as for hearing her , it was not nearly as well as I could hear her on my old set , so I probably over rated this product , panasonic used to make good products but seems latley every thing I buy from them is not up to standards . If you want to yell while talking on this product then it is for you , I would not buy this product again .	-1
Just does n't work . No sound clarity , customers said I sounded like was in a box . $ 12 . you get what you pay for . Do n't waste your 12 bucks and move up to some $ 30 ones- you pick .	-1
This product did not stay on my head well . I used it for gaming , and could not handle the constant head movement through multi screen play . Going with bluetooth instead .	-1
I can hear the speaker at the other end well enough , but apparently my voice sounds like it 's under water , or else there is a constant hum in the background . Ultimately not very useful , but not worth the price of sending back .	-1
The sounds is just too low . No volume control , and no mute either . I knew I should n't have deviated from the Plantronics . Placed order for Plantronics after this ... very disappointing .	-1
Initially , sound was good compared with the competition . But within a couple of weeks , I started getting all sorts of crackling sounds . The problem is probably in the submini phone plug making a poor connection with the handset . I had the same trouble with several handsets.I have put the product in the trash .	-1
Just okay for the price . I have had some complaints from people saying they could not hear me . Very cheap , mostly plastic . Would have give it another star if it fold like my old one for storage . Will use until I can find something better .	-1
I bought this intending to plug it into my computer . No , it does n't fit those ports . Fortunately there is a proper jack on my desktop phone , and the product works with that . So , not a total waste .	-1
Probably got about 3-4 years of pretty infrequent use out of this machine . Worked well enough until just recently , now I have the H07 error .	-1
This is my second comment on this card . I have recently found out that there are compatibility issues with some higher memory cards and certain cameras and manufacturers . Apparently the firmware version I have on my Olympus C-5050 is v77 and works poorly with higher capacity cards . Companies are still giving little info on this , but Viking 's website says the CF1GB works on my camera ...	-1
I bought this adapter to connect to my Linksys router.PROS++ Cheap priceCONS -- Loses connection often . I would constantly lose my wireless connection to my router. -- Low signal strength - My computer was about 20 feet away from my router but I was constantly only getting 1-2 bars signal strength . Newer wireless adapters have more then just this 1 antenna .	-1
I 've set up 3 Linksys wireless adapters now -- two of these and oneLinksys WPC54GS Wireless-G Notebook Adapter with SpeedBoosterto work with myLinksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router with SpeedBooster . The first one of these and the Notebook Adapter had serious issues in handshaking with the router and required significant time on the phone with Linksys to set up , and I 'm still not completely happy with their functionality.Surprisingly , this second WMP54G that I installed had no issues whatsoever , and setup was a breeze . Too bad it only lasted 3 weeks before `` frying '' itself.Am waiting now on a replacement from Linksys .	-1
I had so many hope in this pen ... and I find the tip is off for 2 or 3 mm , very annoying for an illustrator . Worse yet Wacom does n't know how to fix it , also is kind of light does n't feel right and I 'm an artist with a lot years of free hand sketching . But hey it work with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 ( GT-N5110 ) , but just not as it suppose to .	-1
I bought this item for use with my Tivo . It it was one of their two recommended USB network adaptors ( the other is Linksys 100TX and I had to replace that 3 times within 6 months ) . Now that it 's broke I am on hold with their tech support and it 's a very painful exsperience . They are getting worse and worse . The item itself is VERY flimsy like other users have stated . It just stopped working for no reason . I will never buy a linksys adator again , they should stick with making routers and hubs .	-1
I got this to connect my DSL modem to a portable computer . It works fine when it is working , but the connection is pure Mickey Mouse . The little trap door connection site is so flimsy a minor brush will disconnect you . Plus , the little door falls off when this occurs , and it takes a watchmaker 's skills to get it back together . The latest brush even broke a tiny plastic peg that attaches one of the door 's hinges . Surely Linksys is capable of better design .	-1
This is a horrible design for an adapter . The ethernet cable is held in palce but a pop up door . The door is flimsy and it will break . There is no question about it . Just a matter of time , and once it breaks it is pretty much useless . I am currently using rubberbands to hold it in place . There are much better and cheaper products than this one .	-1
WARNUNG ! The IQue Palm Series Garmin PDA/GPS handheld systems will no longer be able to run through Microsoft PC based platforms . This will render any of the Palm series IQue 3500 and other Garmin Palm OS based systems useless in so far as Windows Vista is concerned . Garnmin has no plans to port their Palm Desktop drivers , and sync software to Vista .	-1
Just like another reviewer , my DCR-TRV19 I purchased almost exactly 18 months ago stopped `` seeing '' . Like another reviewers state , all other functions are retained . When recording it will record the audio w/o video . I have owned several Sony camcorders and I guess quality at Sony is going down .	-1
Just got this 514 today . I got it on buy.com for 9 bucks so that was a steal . However , I am starting to realise why they gave it away for $ 9 . The setup was pretty smooth . I got it done in one shot . However , it has been dropping the connection every 5 minutes or so , sometimes even more often . I am sitting right in front of the thing and the signal strength is excellent . I do not understand why this is happening.For what I paid , I will live with the dropped connections . This router is not worth even a penny more though , so be careful before you buy.ps . The connection dropped thrice in the space of writing this mail . I am starting to think whether it is even worth what I paid !	-1
As noted on several websites ( with which I have no affiliation ) , SanDisk SD/MMC cards work slower than SimpleTech or Lexar when plugged into Palm Devices . This is especially true of writes on my Palm Tunsten T.Note that if you remove a SanDisk from a Palm and modify its contents thru an external SD & quot ; reader & quot ; , you will see read/write performance that is similar to its competition.The problem appears to be unique to Palm devices , if you are n't using this for a Palm device , I am not aware of a reason to avoid this product .	-1
Switched to Mac ? Switch back.I built an 802.11b network for the PCs in my house . I set up everything and had it working and tested for a few weeks before tackling the Airport install . Since I 'm not usually a Mac user , I thought I 'd make sure everything else was working first.Well , it was the right decision . 8 months later , my Airport card still does not work . I put it in our iBook , and it 's recognized , but there is an error message that locks up all the wireless applications and configuration , so the Airport is useless . Yes , I have the right OS version , and I 've gotten the latest drivers and applications , but nothing works.I 'll try again , sometime , but it 's just really hard to get psyched up for hours and hours of beating your head against the wall , trying to get something to work.Hey , it might work out of the box for you . If you have an older iBook , though , I 'd prepare for a struggle .	-1
The local computer superstore did not have an ordinary mechanical KVM switch available , so I went with the Belkin on the strength of their reputation . Unfortunately , certain assumptions are made in the design of this unit that cause it to be poorly suited to use with my setup ; I 'm trying to control a docked Dell D600 laptop and a Compaq desktop from the same keyboard , mouse and monitor . There are several issues involved which the instructions do n't take into account . First , the KVM switch wants to use the same keystroke as part of its selection sequence that the laptop wants to use as a control signal emulation ; the `` scroll lock '' key . This caused the need to select a different key for the laptop 's control signal , which had its own set of issues as a result . Second , it turns out that the KVM switch is picky about the timing of the two keystrokes needed to swap from one system to the other ; lag too long between keystrokes , or try to swap back too soon , and the sequence gets ignored.I wish I had saved the packaging and receipt ; this purchase would be going back to the store if I had , but some of the problems did n't become apparent for a couple of weeks because one of the computers involved was n't present right away.I 'm going to replace this gadget with a mechanical switchbox from a different source .	-1
These headphones start out with white noise . Then in about 30 seconds generate a loud crakeling noise . I wanted to return them . But unfortunately , I discarded the packageing before I had a chance to use them on a flight .	-1
I needed a travel set of headphones , so the reviews convinced me to try these . OK , not so good ! I travel with a Zen V+ MP3 ( and a CMoy Amplifier for times when the background noise is too much to overcome otherwise ) . The earbuds that came with the Zen ( I 'll bet , not top-of-the-line ) compare well to the PX 100 's . I found the PX 100 unconfortable to wear , even for a few minutes ( but maybe my head is on wrong , or something ) . I 've decided to travel with my ( very ) old Sony V6 's -- large , but totally confortable and incomparable better sound than the PX 100 . I guess I 'd say the the V6 's have a `` transparency '' of the sound -- an impression of life , presence , vitality -- rather than the impression of distance and flattness in a foggy day that I get from the PX 100's.I do n't write a lot of review , and most of the ones I write are negative ( although I buy-buy-buy from the internet ) to help other avoid my mistakes . This was one of my mistakes . Generally , Sennheisser 's are expensive , upper-end . Maybe I should have suspected that the price of the PX 100 's reflected the quality and effort put into them.One thing I have not tried is the `` ear canal '' buds . I 'm not a purist audiophile , simply someone who enjoys music listening ( mostly popular , w/ some classical thrown in ) .	-1
What I ordered : Sennheiser PX 100What I expected : Sennheiser PX 100What I got : Sennheiser PX 100-IIThanks for lying . Since I live in South East Asia and the freight costs 1/2 the price of the earphones , I 'm not even going to bother to send it back and just take it as bad luck .	-1
One star because I want people to know the sound quality of these Sennheisers is passible at best . I generally use Sony MDR-V150s with my iPod because the quality and price are great . Much better sound than these Sennheisers . I ONLY use these to backpack because I 'm a super light weight backpacker and these are small and fold . That 's all I 'd use them for . Other wise the Sonys every time . I 'm a music freak , thousands of albums , CDs , digital files , worked at Towerrecords etc . I 'm into sound but I also like to keep my money . I 've got half a dozen headphones or more . Believe me , the Sonys are good for the money .	-1
First of all , FWIW , I listen to classical music , especially to opera.I had an awesome Sennheiser HD433 . Unfortunately they do n't make this model anymore . I went to a store that carries Sennheisers and tried one headphone after another to check which one comes close to the HD433 . The salesperson was also impressed by the quality of HD433 ( I brought with me to compare ) and agreed to no headphone came closer , even the most expensive ones . This PX100 sounded the best of them and I bought a pair of those . In the first couple of days I was impressed , then , all of the sudden the sound quality started to deteriorate . The bass started to be too powerful , the treble was gone and the midrange with no significant presence . I am very disappointed with this headphone and I am willing to resume my hunt for another headphone that gives me the pleasure that the HD433 did .	-1
These are terrible . I had the PX-100 's and was going to switch them for the PX-200 's , huge mistake . One , they do n't reduce outside noise , and do n't cancel the noise from your headphones . Two , there is no bass at all . Three , buy the PX-100 's . Cheaper , and 400 times better .	-1
Stereo Sound but at what price ? .I never thought I would pay 50 bucks for this and since I got this as gift , I was excited.Save your money , This is not what you would expect from $ 50 sound !	-1
For $ 100 more , buy the 28-105mm 3.5-4.5 version . results are far better . This lens ( 4-5.6 ) is not quite there . do n't even buy it .	-1
I wish I had just bought a regular fax machine . The documentation for using this product is pathetic . I am an experienced computer user and it took me a couple hours to figure it all out . I finally discovered that I ca n't send more than one file with the software that comes with this thing ( my scanner creates a separate file for each page ) . I ended up using the Windows Fax Manager application ( Win 7 OS ) with the TrendMicro hardware because that software allows me to combine files .	-1
The modem never worked but was too cheap to return . It installed okay but would never actually dial out . I found another modem in an old PC in the garage and it worked just fine .	-1
No note of if it was a soft modem , or hardware based modem . I do n't enjoy the thought of having the modem have to operate out of the CPU . I would prefer if that part of the computer can operate on its own.I did not keep this item , I had to return it . I suggest a hardware modem , something old , something external . Something kept in the family for safe keeping . They do keep your telephone line nice in the trunk for your area .	-1
This modem worked , but it was flakey . Because of the weight , it seems to sag if you put it into a horizontal USB plug ( I recommend vertical ) .The bottom line is the device broke less than a year after purchase , and that is with very little use . I had this setup on my mom computer , which she uses about once a week ( at most ) . Maybe there is a warranty on it , but for the cost it 's not worth the hassle .	-1
I purchased this drive 6 months ago as a spare and just recently installed it . The drive has a controller board error . I contacted Western Digital for a replacement , but they tell me that it is out of warranty . Apparently the year warranty starts ticking the day the drive leaves the factory and not the day you purchase it . If it sits on a store shelf for over a year you do not get any warranty from Western Digital . With other manufacturers providing 5 year warranties , I will never buy Western Digital again .	-1
Do n't buy one of these until they fix what must be a design flaw . As others have noted , there is a high pitched whine audible whenever the box is switched on . It 's there regardless of whether any music is playing or not . This is almost certainly a design flaw . It could be aliasing noise , a leaky carrier tone , etc.XM is an interesting concept , but this boombox is poorly implemented .	-1
Boombox was ok right of the box . The problem is the unit is poor quality . My unit has never even moved off my desk since its purchase . Here we are 7 months later and the sound has quit working . Delphi warranties the thing for a year , but its a big hassle . They should just exchange the unit right away . You just ca n't go turn another radio on when you using satellite .	-1
I use this 256M Xd Olympus for my C5050 . taking pictures is good and comparable to the 256M compact flash with about half of the price tag . Ater downloaded the pictures to my computer , the card went poopy ! ! ( card error and can not be able to reformated ) I used the same Sandisk card reader as for my compact flash card ! I used the other reader ( computer built in ) , well I fried another 64M Xd fujifilm . Performance may be ! but reliable , I do n't think so . Giving a 2 is too generous ! ! !	-1
Out of three DVD players this disc would not load , with various error messages for each dvd player . On cd player , disc would not eject requiring me to disassemble unit to remove dvd cleaner . So not good luck for me	-1
As far as cleaning , I was n't impressed and that 's what I really bought this item for . The portion dedicated to proper set up of your sound system is pretty good . If you have a CD/ DVD player that does n't get much use and you just want something to run through every now and then , this may work fine , for my truck 's CD player , it 's not cutting it .	-1
Did nothing to repair my nonworking disc ! No less scratches , no nothing ! In fact , it seemed to made it worse ...	-1
The manual CD repair products do a far better job than this one . In fact , I could n't see that it did anything at all . It does a fair job with mere cleaning , but who needs to spend this kind of money to clean discs when you can clean them for free with water and a soft cloth ?	-1
I got this Apple 1GHz iMac , but it 's a lemon.The speakers did n't sound at all when I first time turned it on.The screen quality is kind of fuzzy compare to Sony 's and Apple LCD monitors.Also it 's slow . Even the unit had 1GHz CPU with DDR , but it did n't make any big improvement with other slower iMac Models.The only thumb up feature is the styling look.It really can dress up your office , but do n't count on it 's performance .	-1
Unless you own a rechargeable battery factory , you must have a supply of freshly-charged batteries on hand to use this camera . If you charged the batteries last week , have not used them , the charge may have decayed enough for the camera to not work . I have tried several brands of premium batteries with the same results . Many times I have switched the camera ON only to receive the `` low battery '' warning and watch the camera switch itself OFF . As a result , I have missed several photo opportunities.In addition , the display is slow to respond if the camera is moved to better frame a subject .	-1
I am NOT HAPPY with this camera . Here 's why ... :1 . This camera is very bulky compared with almost any camera ( for the same resolution ) out there in the market . Since this camera is not available for display in popular electronic stores , you really can not hold it in your hand and get a feel for it BEFORE you buy it . I like my camera to be slim and small . Else I do n't feel like carrying it with me when I ought to . What then is the point of buying a camera ? 2 . This camera is power hungry ! . It sucks the juice out of the batteries in no time . I find myself changing batteries all the time . And yes , I do use NiMH batteries as the manufacturer reccomends . Talking of replacing batteries , the battery compartment door looks pretty flimsy and does n't lock very well . I have a premonition that this door is going to dictate the life of this camera.3 . I use a 256 MB compact flash card and it takes forever to save an image after clicking.IMHO , there are smaller/slimmer cameras ( that use just 2 AA batteries ) available for the same or lesser price .	-1
This camera takes beautiful photos . The wide lense gives a nice straight picture.However ... A set of AA alkalines lasts for only 5-10 flash photos.Using expensive lithium batteries allows the camera to consume all it wants and thus overheats to the point that touching the memory card burns you . Laughably , the manual warns against touching the hot memory card after long continuous use ! The battery door is plastic and becomes chewed up by the metal case . Also , the zoom is easily damaged by switching on the camera accidentally when it 's in a bag.I bought the Canon S50 . It was a couple hundred dollars more and photo quality is a tad poorer than the S414 , but it has a rechargeable battery which lasts for a whole day of photos and the memory card hardly even gets warm .	-1
TWO YEAR UPDATE : After two years of use , I love it more and hate it less.It is worked WIHOUT FAIL on daily use . I ca n't say this about most of my electronic gear . I use it mostly for `` time shifting '' of my favorite radio programs . I also use it to listen to books on tape ( which I 've dubbed over ) ... again it is a great product for this . The bookmarking feature is wonderful for keeping track where you 're at in the book.I now have the SonicStage version 2 and it is much better . Still not great ... but much more useable. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I use my MD player every day so , obviously , something is right about it . I actually own two ! But I also want to write a cranky email to this engineer at Sony signed off on the software ! It is AMAZINGLY bad ! SonicStage ( 1.5 is my version ) is SO counter-intuitive that I just ca n't use it ... and I 'm pretty savvy with computer stuff . LITERALLY -- I ca n't use it.I ca n't figure out any way to just drag-and-drop songs to the player in the SonicStage software . Why in the world not ? It 's baffling.Instead Sony makes you go through this ridiculous `` check in check out '' process . ( or is it `` check out - check in '' ? ) It makes no sense to me . Maybe if you grew up on right-brained computer games like Mario Brothers , you could just let go of the need for logic.FORTUNATELY , you can get a plug-in for RealAudio which is better but still not that great . The SimpleBurner is n't too bad either -- it 's just limited to copying your CDs.The Sony MD player is terrific at recording stuff off the radio for time-shifting . However , Sony wo n't let you transfer it back on to your computer for safe-keeping . The only way to do this is real time dubbing through your sound card . How FRUSTRATING ! The MD could be one terrific tool for ripping your old LPs , or whatever , but Sony has made this impractical . This crippling of functions by Sony makes it useless for lots of people , I 'm sure.The compression and audio quality are terrific and it sounds great to my ears , even at the highest compression rates.One terrific thing you can do with the MD is record off you favorite radio stations and then edit out the commercials and even move the songs around . This is so easy to do , that I do this while on my evening walks ! You end up with a custom `` best of '' tape . But , then it 's a pain-in-the-neck if you want to get that back on your computer.The price is a deal for such a great piece of hardware and the MD disks are cheap , sturdy and hold a lot . I take mine on trips all over the world and even 5 MDs is plenty . I take my MD places that I would be nervous to take an IPod or some other higher-priced MP3 player . Also , battery life is great and it uses just normal AA 's which you can buy anywhere -- a big advantage for travel.Even though it is marketed as `` speedy '' it does n't seem that fast to me . I have n't ' actually timed it , but I think you could burn an MP3 CD quite a bit faster.So , if you want to time-shift NPR or Rush , it 's a great little machine . I havne't seen anything around that can beat it . But I would n't recommend it for listening to MP3s.If Sony had just written better software and had n't crippled it , the MD player would be killer . But , it 's good for some functions like time shifting .	-1
I bought this because it was cheap and I just wanted to use it as an extra network switch , and possibly an access point later . First thing I wanted to do was change the IP address so it coincided with the rest of my network . By doing this the router gets confused and changes to a random IP . It still works with the settings you had in it before changing the IP but you ca n't connect to it to configure anything else . If you try to use the `` Access Point Only '' mode , that does n't work either and the router stops working altogether . In both situations you have to reset it to factory defaults and start all over . Belkin has no fix for this problem , I called them . Their solution was unacceptable and here we are a couple years after I bought this thing and they still have n't fixed it . Buy Belkin cables , stay away from all their electronics with firmware and/or software , they do n't support them very well .	-1
There no other word to describe this camera . Do n't go for its 3MP/3x tag , there are many others things which need to be good . For example picture quality , battery life , features , indoor pics , build quality are all bad.Anyways the camera is n't worth your money . Just 3MP does n't mean good pics ...	-1
I have a 32 '' letterbox Toshiba TV ( NOT high definition ) . I put in a DVD and then used the zoom to fill the tv screen . The picture quality degraded very badly . Be clear , it was not a minor amount . The faces became blurred and the colors turned to mush . I tried everything in the manual to correct the problem . I tried the same test on my old Philips DVD player and the picture only degraded a minor amount . I am not recommending Philips because it has a hard time with episode DVD 's , remote is bad news , and loading is forever.I am not a picky detailed person . If something works okay that is good enough . I do not expect perfection.The remote on the Panasonic was okay and the DVD tray opened quickly . See , I found something good to say about the Panasonic .	-1
It worked well , but after constant use for 2 weeks they broke . Different parts broke . Will not buy again . Sad	-1
First , this product is very difficult and impractical to use . Whatever speed you can work with on a regular mouse , this is 4-5 times slower ( for example , if a task takes 1 second on a regular mouse , it will take 4-5 seconds on this mouse ) . It is so slow and impractical that you will abandon it after a few minutes of use.Second , I purchased this product thinking the joy stick has a joint and you keep the mouse in one , idle positions and push the stick in different direction and move it ( like those helicopter commands ) . There is no moving joint . It is FIXED so you have to move the entire actual thing around . It is not a light mouse to move.Third , moving around is not so much the problem . The real problem is HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO MOVE IT just to move the mouse pointer across the screener . You will have to get an Extra-Large mouse pad because will not fit on a regular mouse pad ; it has to be moved at least 8 inches just to move the pointer across the screen.Fourth , it feels really awkward and unnatural to use.Fifth , 3M does not even offer a specific driver for this mouse . It does not come with a CD and all sorts of Google searches did not yield a legitimate driver software so 3M has not released one.CONCLUSION : In short , you will be moving this mouse over large distance just for simple tasks . It takes 4-5 longer to use than a regular mouse to use , both because of the distances and because it is awkward and unnatural.It 's also over-priced relative to what you get . I really do n't recommend it at all .	-1
iRiver gives you a one year warranty and it WILL break after that one year . Contacted their customer service for repair options . They said , essentially : `` drop dead '' .Same problem as other reviewers : these buttons break . Poor quality and poor engineering - great for a few days.You can not do worse with other brands . Try them first !	-1
Granted , I have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for Christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . First , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . When I hit & quot ; menu & quot ; it told me , & quot ; playback only. & quot ; I actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu . This is extemely lame . The remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . In addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . The player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . It also has an optical out , which it should . I think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .	-1
Actually , $ 5 passive antenna from other company makes it possible to receive FM station located 50 miles away from my place . This one gives only static	-1
This antenna seems cheaply made and when plugged into my Tivoli Audio Model Two radio it actually increased static . The included single wire antenna actually received better than the Terk FM+ . Thankfully Amazon was able to credit me for this item .	-1
This antenna seems to get mixed reviews , but I decided to give it a try . As many others have said , it just does n't seem to work in my area . My & # 34 ; T & # 34 ; wire antenna gets better results .	-1
Reading the reviews of this Terk antenna is a bizarre experience . People have dramatically improved their reception and love this product , or people 's reception has n't changed , and they hate it.I 'm unfortunately in the latter category . Worse , even : the Terk actually gives me *worse* FM reception than the standard single-wire that came with my Tivoli , and that 's true no matter where I put it and no matter which local stations I listen to here in NYC . Bizarre . Oh well . Not worth the trip to the post office and the return postage . I threw it out . No lesson learned here , because there 's no lesson to *be* learned . Just hope for the best .	-1
I travel extensively internationally ( around 30 weeks a year ) so I was looking for a universal adapter that I could stick in my bag instead of having to remember to bring the right adapter for each business trip.I tried this adapter out and found it was lacking.Pros:1 . It does work in most outlets worldwide . The one exception is some UK safety sockets ... more later2 . It is not too terribly large3 . The trendy white color : - ) Cons:1 . It will stop working frequently when using the europlug . In order to make electrical contact the europlug must be flipped all the way up . Unfortunately it is on a hinge with very little resistance so any weight on it ( like a cable plugged into it ) causes the plug adapter itself to rotate on this hinge causing the plug to lose contact . You only have to wake up to a dead cell phone once before figuring this out.2 . It does not work in UK safety sockets . Some of the safety sockets in the UK require the grounding pin to hit a switch that allows the rest of the plug to go in . For some reason this plug does not always work in those.3 . It is bigger than it looks in the picture.In summary , buy the Kensington model instead . I have 2 and they work great.Kensington 33117 International All-in-One Travel Plug Adapter	-1
This is a fairly useless device . It does not convert voltage , and since most other countries use 220 volts , you will simply destroy your shaver or cell phone if you use this.This fact should be prominantly advertised , and it is not .	-1
This is a plug adapter only , not a voltage converter . This was not clear in the advertising . My only clue was the sticker across the plug holes that said , YOU NEED A CONVERTER to use this ! GEEZ . Keep shopping . Find a converter/plug adapter kit instead .	-1
PLEASE CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING A CANON 'A ' SERIES CAMERA . Slightly more than a year ago I bought a Canon PowerShot A70 , having read many excellent reviews of it and having compared it with other 3MP cameras then on the market . Until a few days ago ( when its warranty had lapsed by several weeks ) the camera was a joy ; all the good things said about it in its many reviews had proven true . But then , one afternoon , out of the blue , an 'E18 ! ' error : the camera 's optical unit failed , the lens would not retract , and the camera became completely nonfunctional . To no avail I tried the few remedies suggested by Canon tech support on line , by e-mail , and over the phone ( where responses were quick , courteous , but completely ineffectual ) . The telephone tech rep then informed me that I could send the camera , at my expense , to Canon , who would repair it for anywhere from $ 100 to $ 200 . I asked him if lens-unit failure was a common problem with the camera ( already , from the dozens of reports I 'd read on the web , I knew it was ) , and , quite candidly , he replied that it was . He added that this was true with ALL PowerShot 'A ' series cameras , so that I could not buy a subsequent model ( e.g. , A75 or A80 ) with any confidence that the 'E18 ' problem would not occur with it . Please read the negative reviews of this camera and consider that the problems described may affect your camera ( and those of the rave review writers ) several weeks or months into ownership . For over 40 years I had been a highly satisfied user of Canon products ( most of them , unlike the new digital cameras , made in Japan ) . No longer , alas , since I shall not buy another Canon camera .	-1
All PowerShot A70 owners who 've seen problems with the camera sensor ( CCD ) failing to function or exhibiting excess noise or other image distortion should take advantage of a recall . Canon will repair this widely seen CCD defect for free even if your camera is out of warranty.See the A70 support page on Canon 's website or search for `` PowerShot A70 CCD failure '' . [ ... ] Unfortunately , Canon is n't making this offer conspicuous on its website and is not contacting customers proactively . I only learned of it on an independent camera review website.I had contacted Canon Support about terrible noise problems in photos I 'd taken ( often discovered only later , when reviewing photos on the computer ) , and at first they failed to reply , let alone inform me of the free repair program . After discovering the recall notice , I contacted them again to request free repair , and they 've agreed to repair my camera.In other respects , I 've been very happy with the PowerShot A70 's features and performance , but not very impressed with some design defects and this CCD problem . The only mitigating factor with the CCD defect is that several other manufacturers ' cameras have been affected by the same problem , though they 've dealt with their customers better in addressing it . Olympus offers to repair cameras with CCDs that may be defective , regardless of whether the camera is currently exhibiting problems.This issue , combined with a Canon camcorder that is now unreliable due to a widely-seen recorder section problem , severely undermines Canon 's reputation for quality . This is especially disappointing for me because I believe Canon 's products are often functionally superior , and I previously had Canon film cameras that were bulletproof .	-1
Look , a great number of people I know exclaim about how great Canon 's are in general , especially the S400 . I am going to talk about why the Sony DSC P10 destroys the Canon S400 and to address the gripes of other reviewers.The only advantages the Canon S400 has over the Sony P10 are as follows:1 . Flash is more centered over lens of camera to avoid & quot ; shadow & quot ; effect2 . Compactflash memory is cheaper3 . Double sided memory sticks are & quot ; bad & quot ; 4 . The S400 has 9 points of autofocus , compared to the P10 's 3Yes , I know the flash on the Sony is not centered over the lens , thus in theory it would cast shadows over the subject , BUT in practice , THIS HARDLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE . For the most part , I have not even noticed that this was possible , but in those small instances if I payed extremely close attention , I could notice that something small and insignificant placed in a very specific way in front of the subject was casting a slight shadow on the subject in like 1 in 100 of the night pictures I take.This is FAR outweighed by the fact that Canon 's in general , and this PARTICULAR Canon , has THE WORST lighting problems I have ever seen . SKIN TONES , COMPLETELY wrong . Canon has a history of problems with underexposing color tones and this camera is no different . Using TWO different A400 's , the skin tones of people in the pictures often comes out terrible . People 's skin often comes out EXTRAORDINARILY yellow and fuzzy . I am not sure what causes this problem , but this ALONE renders the camera completely useless in mild light conditions . Go develop some night pictures off the A400 before you buy it and you 'll see what I 'm talking about . The skin tones come out all wrong and it is obvious to almost everybody . Especially if you are Asian ! They 're not THAT yellow ! Compare the pictures side by side to the Sony P10 and I guarantee you can tell.First of all , compactflash memory is only cheaper than memory sticks if you do n't know how to shop . Sure , if you buy a Viking Compactflash card then it 'll be cheaper , but then again you should n't be doing that anyways since Viking makes dangerously terrible cards . Furthermore , if you shop on amazon.com , you can buy a 256MB SONY brand memory stick for practically the same price as a reputable maker of a CF card ! I agree , that memory stick pros are not that great since they have that really odd copyright protection , but if you plan to only put pictures on this card , then that should not even be an issue . Also , people have complained about the & quot ; double-sided & quot ; memory sticks and how inconvenient they are . Both me and my dad have one and we actually think it 's better than a conventional 256MB stick . First of all , if you have an MP3 player then it would be nice to keep MP3 's on one side of the card and pictures on the other . You do n't want to mix the two , and it 's a great way of dividing it . Why would you not want to mix the two ? Say you wanted to format the card to delete all your pictures so that you can take a whole new round of pictures . If you had a 256MB compactflash , you would delete all your MP3 's as well , or you would have to delete each of your 100 pictures one by one.With the double sided stick , you can just delete one side at a time , leaving all your MP3 's . The same holds true if you are just taking only pictures as well . If you want to keep some pictures or movies on your card for a presentation or demonstration on a TV , then you can keep those pictures on one side of the card , and then continue formatting and taking pictures on the other side freely . And when you do have to switch the sides , it really is n't annoying at all . You just take out the card and move one button . This is far easier than tying your shoes . So one reviewer named tmchow complained on switching sides to the memory stick that it was & quot ; Far too much hassle for me.. sounds easy in theory , but in real life , you will hate it & quot ; He must wear velcro shoes or something , because if you can do simple things like tie your shoes , SURELY you can press one button , really it 's not hard at all.And WHY on EARTH would a non-professional photographer need NINE points of autofocus ? ! ? That would mean you would like to focus on an object NOT in the center of the picture and leave everything else blurry . So this spectacular feature would come in handy in the following situation , you are taking a picture of two people at a restaurant but you would like to focus on the salt shaker , but leave the two people fuzzy . USELESS . So basically if you would ever like to focus on something completely outside the center of the picture but leave the remaining 90 % of the picture fuzzy , buy this Canon for the wonderful autofocus flexibility.So let 's look at why the Sony P10 is clearly better:1 . I like people 's skin to look like how it does in real life.that ALONE should be enough , but let 's carry on2 . Sony P10 is 5 megapixel3 . 20 % longer battery life , VERY important in digital photography4 . Takes great pictures in the dark , and even has a solid night modeSome people get completely lost in megapixels and think that more megapixels is better and forget the rest of the camera . Not true , megapixels only matter if you are blowing up your pictures to uncommon and extravagant sizes like 20 X 30 . In this case , the Sony P10 takes far better night pictures as well as having more megapixels . But if you really insist on messing up everyone 's skin tones , go right ahead and buy this camera.People keep talking about how compact the A400 is . Well , in my experience , pants pockets generally are rectangular , not square . Making the Sony P10 a far better fit when it comes to a conventional pocket.Overall , Canon cameras are completely overrated by all those blind Canon lovers . Do n't be biased !	-1
Just received the response shown below after me second email to Canon . It seems familiar - exact wording that I saw on another website claiming ignorance about a problem . I have now filed a complaint with the California and New York Attorney General 's Office and the New York BBB . I strongly suggest all of you with this problem to do likewise so we can build a fire under Canon . If your camera has this problem and you have n't yet posted to this site let us hear from you . We should also start posting to other shopping websites ( dealcatcher , epinions , etc ) as well as the photography sites , including their Letters to the Editor . We need to make others aware of the way Canon has turned this problem into a profit center. -- -- -- -- -- -- Thank you for contacting Canon product support . We value you as a Canon customer and appreciate the opportunity to assist you.Please note , Canon USA does not monitor , confirm , endorse , or attest to the accuracy of any information posted on third party websites . It seems many customers are overwhelmed by the barrage of information ( or misinformation ) being posted on unregulated , non-Canon websites .

Very disappointed with this purchase . Their Tech Support was pretty good although they could n't help with drivers for other software . I wanted to capture some old VHS tapes . The capture software supplied was poor , I had other capture software , but none would work with this card because Hauppuage does n't have any drivers for other capture software .I had many other problems while trying to capture . If I changed to full screen while capturing the software would change channels ! I returned the card for a refund and I am looking at other cards .	-1
I live in the boondocks and still cant get this item to work . It has lots of static , and is not clear at all . The range is more likt 2 inches and no where near the 10 - 30 ft as advertised . Belkin is ripping people of on a product that looks like heaven .	-1
If you live in a locale that has a multitude of radio stations that come in relatively well , this puppy does n't work at all , it is n't powerful . You end up spending hours just trying to adjust the damn thing so it will be picked up by the radio . When you finally find the `` sweet spot '' in your vehicle , the sound quality is so awful ( LOTS of bass distortion ) it 's not even worth listening to . To top it off , it eats batteries like a mofo .	-1
I saw this , and thought & quot ; The solution ! ! ! & quot ; -- I wanted to play my IPOD through my CD only car stereo . Wrong . It sounds like a frustratingly almost out of range FM station . True , we have a very strong signal at 88.5 , but none at the other frequencies . I thought it might be the distance to the antenna ( at the car rear ) . Tried it at home , with a boom box . I 'm afraid 30 feet maximum range , 10 feet for optimum performance is not just wishful thinking , it is mis-representation ! This doesnt work with any fidelity whatsoever at a distance of more than 1 foot ! I thought it might be defective , but I 'm guessing not .	-1
I got this device about two months ago , and up until tonight , it performed admirably . Setup was easy , I got my internet connection up and running in about 5 minutes , and got all my wireless security settings up and running in another 15.Up until now , it has performed well . However , its failure tonight and subsequent wading through Netgear 's technical support offerings turned me off of this product forever.I was playing World of Warcraft , and after about an hour , my connection abruptly died altogether . No internet , I could not even access the router 's internal setup page to check on its status . It seemed to be in some sort of hard-locked state . Rebooting it did n't improve things.I broke out the CD that came with the device , with the idea of looking at the manual ( they do n't give you a paper copy , it 's all on the CD ) . Pretty basic stuff , checking connections , etc . The troubleshooting section was full of hints on how to make sure that it is n't a problem with another component in your system before daring to blame theirs . I have a more surefire method . My old trusty Linksys Etherfast cable/dsl router had no trouble getting me back online.So I went to netgear 's website to download the latest firmware.With the firmware image ready , my next task was to get the Netgear device back up and running so I could access its setup page . I discovered that if I disconnected the WAN cable going to my cable modem , the device would actually stay in a usable state . If I connect the WAN cable , it seems to die within about 15 seconds . Ordinarily I 'd suspect something to be wrong with my cable modem here , but my Linksys router has no trouble with it as I have been online problem-free for over an hour using it now , as I 'm writing this review.Anyway , I got the thing to boot , and loaded the new firmware image on it , then restarted the router . I hit the setup page again , only to discover it has been replaced by a `` wizard '' . The wizard was unable to get an address via DHCP , and so guessed that I use a static IP . Or at least , that is what I am imagining happened as it displayed `` we are now detecting your internet connection settings '' for several moments and then announced that I needed to enter static IP information.The thing that most galled me about this is that they do n't provide a way to say `` no , that 's not correct . I use DHCP . And where the hell are the rest of the menus I used to use ? '' I discovered you can get to these if you forge static IP settings and tell it to continue . On the failure page that results , you can find a link that takes you to the `` basic settings '' section , which is essentially the menu system the old firmware used to set up the router.The summary of this complaint is this : the device and its associated software go to great lengths to make setup easy , and to minimize the steps necessary to get things running , *if everything is working . * I imagine many customers can just breeze through the wizard and get themselves online . However , if something goes wrong , the `` wizard '' is useless . For one thing , almost all of the technical support documentation 's suggestions are impossible to carry out without fighting your way past the wizard into the normal configuration.So for now I 'm back on my trusty Linksys , without wireless support , but given the reliability I 've experienced between the two brands , I 'm going to buy a Linksys wireless router instead .	-1
I really thought this would be a great product . But if you have an iPod Touch or iPhone , you 'll often get `` unable to join network '' and if you have a PS3 , you 'll often get a 8013013D error . Even both our macs in the house could n't connect . We 've been through two of these and both have the same issue . We 've replaced the PS3 and same error again . We 've returned it , went with a Linksys WRT54G and have not had a single issue .	-1
I purchased this router a while ago . After installing it and following the setup instructions , I found out the router was n't obtaining an IP address from the cable network . I tried both using the router 's MAC address , and making the router `` clone '' the PC 's MAC address ; none of them worked . Then I upgraded the router 's firmware to its latest version ; that did n't help either.At first , I thought the issue had to do with my cable company , but after reverting to my original configuration ( PC directly connected to the cable modem ) , the DHCP problems were solved . Checking in Netgear 's forums and in some other sites around the Internet , I 've found many customers with similar issues.I decided to discontinue using the router , and to purchase a Linksys WRT54G , which has been working flawlessly.Think twice before purchasing this Netgear router ... for the same money , you 'll be able to find a better product .	-1
I chose this Netgear product over other brands simply because in the past , Netgear products have always worked flawlessly . Nowadays however , Netgear 's routers seem to be degrading in quality and the WGR614 is no exception . I recently purchased a version 5 and while it is good for basic routing , any complex addition to a network will cause this router to malfunction ( e.g . adding a network printer ) .I 've talked to tech support over 2 days and the only solution they can give me is that my network printer is at fault however as soon as I tried using a Linksys WRT54G , my network works as expected.If all you need is to route a couple computers together with no extra features , this product should suffice . Otherwise , look elsewhere , especially the Linksys products .	-1
Your mileage may vary , but I feel the pain of the reviewer who went through two routers already . Been there . Doing that . I bought the WGR614 as an upgrade to my MR814 , which ran like a champ . I had visions of blistering-fast wireless speed dancing in my head , since my Dell X300 has fast wi-fi built in.Set-up was a no-brainer on the first WGR614 , but it croaked fifteen minutes later -- just up and died . Amazon 's great return policy had a new one on my doorstep two days later . This one is n't dead , but weeks later I am concluding that it is definitely ill. At least once a day I have to reset all of its information entirely . Several times an hour , the router drops the connection -- last night I was walking a staff member through a long Web-based project , and realized what a nightmare this router is in terms of reliability . I have a rock-steady DSL connection , so that 's not the problem ( if I take the router out of the equation , all 's well , but then , of course , I do n't have wireless access for the other PCs in the house ) .I 've switched the channel on my wireless phone and twiddled with other settings , but that did n't help . Yes , it 's fast , it 's easy to set up , and it 's compact . If yours is working , mazel tov . I just do n't have the patience any more . I 'm going to admit defeat and turn this in for another brand , and get by in the interim with my older router . I 've been loyal to Netgear , and tried hard to stay loyal with this purchase , but I ca n't . ( You can check my other Amazon reviews -- I 'm pretty generous with stuff I like . ) I need a router that works . Try again , Netgear .	-1
I bought this router and it worked well ... for a while . Now it will frequently just stop working . I find that this usually happens when I am not actively using it . I will come home from work and have no internet connection until I unplug the router . Also , it seems to run very hot.Setup is fairly easy and the interface is n't that bad , but having to unplug it every couple of days is highly annoying . I would not suggest buying this router unless you want a headache .	-1
My cable company give me this crappy router for free . It is nice at first allow my desktop and laptop to connect to the internet no problem.However when I connect from my laptop to my desktop PC and try to transfer a file over 100mb It says lost stream half way through it.I hooked up my old Linksys WRT54G v.1.1 no problem . I replace it due to resetting it seem to have been a bad power cable . I am using the power cable from the Netgear on my Linksys and no issues resetting .	-1
This was my third attempt at setting up a router of one brand or another and all either returned or given away after a few weeks . My daughter kept telling me to rent one from Time Warner and I finally did - an it works perfectly . The NetGear was easy to setup but dropped connection frequently and when working was very slow - taking 30 sec . or more to go to another page , wireless or connected . Short videos would frequently stop playing after a few seconds or so and would n't go on no matter how long I waited , wireless or connected . Sometimes I could n't get a connection at all and had to go completely through the setup again and again and again . I did n't try support as I expected little to nothing from past experience with a variety of items . After three weeks of frustration I put it in the GoodWill bag .	-1
This is a nice looking compact device , but that 's where the benefits end . I had this thing for about two months and it worked flawlessly until it died . I unplugged , replugged , unplugged yet again and nothin ' . The modem to which it was attached was also powercycled and when connected directly to a PC it worked fine . Not only was the wireless portion dead but the wired connections were dead as well . The useless Netgear just sat there with some of its LEDs running except for the one with the everything's-OK-checkmark . I tried contacting Netgear 's tech support department but they charge $ 33 for a support call . How nice of them : release s ( * $ t that does n't work right then charge people $ 33 for repair . Nice way to encourage people to never buy your products again . POS . Why the hell does something like this break ? It has no moving parts and is even plugged into a UPS device.Needless to say this wireless router met my concrete floor at a high rate of speed and I 'm about to go out and buy another model from a different company .	-1
WAY too many dropped connections . Their tech support is totally clueless . They said this router doesnt work with my wireless adapter and I needed to buy a Netgear adapter ( wtf ? ! ) . Of course their support is located in India where you can barely understand what they are saying . Avoid this junk at all costs	-1
Over the past 2 years I have owned two 614 's . After 12 months the first one suddenly died . Now the one I paid for as a replacement has died after about 9 months . NetGear stuff tends to work fine for the one year warranty period . Then they die . Maybe they have a built in timer set to kill it 300+ ( a random number ) of days after you turn it on . I am not going to buy another one .	-1
I got this unit to replace both my old DVD player and old VCR . Went with the Sony because it touted being compatible with all the DVD-RW/+RW formats ( which is the only good thing about it ) . From day one , I had problems with it freezing about halfway through each DVD I watched . I think it 's probably at the layer switch as it is constantly around the hour mark . In any event , to fix it , you must hit STOP then PLAY on the remote . It plays the rest of the movie fine after that . It also does many other annoying things that it should n't do , but there 's to much to list here . It 's like a college student 's senior design gone wrong . I 'm going to try and send it back for warranty work , but from what I 've been seeing , I 'm not going to hold my breath . Terrible Sony ... . terrible .	-1
Folks , these are great sounding speakers . They truly are . But these speakers are ALL digital and play TRUE digital sound . Even though they may sound great , these speakers only play 2.1 sound unless you have a DIRECT digital connection . Not even your Audigy 2 can play with all five channels going on here . Even if they are plugged into the D-IN on your Audigy 2 , they will only play 2.1 sound , and no more . If you have an nForce motherboard such as the ASUS deluxe edition , then these speakers are great because on that specific motherboard you can play true-to-life digital sound , including direct Dolby Digital . The decoding on the Audigy 2 soundcard is way different . These speakers are meant generally for consoles and can only be used to the fullest on computers containing an ASUS Deluxe nForce2 motherboard . To those users out there : You are VERY lucky people . For the rest of us with KT400s or etc. , you should go and buy an all-analog system or a digital speaker system made specifically for the Audigy 2 if you want digital . These are not the option .	-1
I 've already replaced this item once . I love the headset but the lifter is weird . My second unit failed today ... just like the first one did : it just quit working . So I started to do research on Google related to problems with it . I also remembered seeing reviews on Amazon prior to our original purchase so I came back and read the three that were already attached to this procuct . I was amazed at the July 2007 review that said GN Netcom tech support said to tap the unit on the side . I did and it worked ! Needless to say , I laughed right out loud ! Evidently a sensor inside the unit is poorly engineered so that every once in awhile it hits a dead spot . A little `` bang '' on the unit either wakes up the unit or gets the sensor off its dead spot . Go figure . This item has been around for awhile too , so I 'm surprised it has n't been reengineered . Sounds like an insert should be put with the operating instructions saying , `` If unit stops working , bang it on its side . `` Update ( June 24 , 2013 ) . I chuckle out loud every time I see another post related to this review . Also want to say that I have `` fixed '' my replacement lifter multiple times since purchasing it .	-1
Part of the problem is that the Denon receiver did n't bother to provide a signal strength meter for non HD stations . So adjusting this is hard . But the Terk user manual gives almost no information . What is the LED mean . Not answered . What does it mean when the LED is red instead of blue . Not addressed . What does the little loop do and how should you position it . Might have been addressed but they did n't explain the parts . Want information from their website ? Nothing more than in the manual . Want to ask a question . You have to create an account.I just know I do n't have enough strong enough signal cause the Denon mutes the sound while I 'm listening , and had very little hint of what to do about it . Probably will buy another antenna .	-1
I was putting this together when the antenna just broke off . They have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off . This also has a huge clumsy AC plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space . When I returned this to the store , I saw another person retuning this exact same model also . GE has a much better model that I bought instead that does n't break and does n't have any AC plug which works wonderfully . Do n't waste your money on this RCA antenna . I give it ZERO stars .	-1
I bought this coffeemaker at the end of August thinking it was a simple , no-nonsense coffeemaker . In mid-May , it started leaking from the vent at the bottom ... at first I thought I did n't have the carafe in correctly or that there was an obstruction with the filter ... after looking at it closely , I noticed a steady drip through the bottom of the coffeemaker . Not good .	-1
I do n't know about sond quality as I could n't use it . I bought these so that I can listen to Music or Web Seminar by connecting to Desktop Under my desk and cord can not reach my ears . Too short a cord . Make sure when you shop the cord length is enough atleat 5 feet or more .	-1
The picture gives the impression these maybe inner canal type headphones , but they are n't . They 're the old-fashioned huge bud that pains small ear holes . Had to return these , because neither my wife or I can tolerate those.Since we did n't use them , we have no idea how they sound .	-1
Black and red text ghost really bad . Try reading your email or text with large black font . See picture added , best I could do with phone camera . I 'm going to return for a different brand . I do n't recommend this . Cable color is actually grey not white .	-1
The gauge of this cable was not specified and it turned out to be much more than my system could use .	-1
I bought these cable tie mounts for management of some computer cables that run through the inside of a metal kiosk , since they were the same size and seemed almost identical to the mounts my company used to get with a different kiosk we used to buy . Well , these Startech HC102 's are absolutely HORRIBLE for our purposes.We stuck up six mounts inside of our kiosk and a couple of hours later we tied up a few cables to them . The only mount that did n't fall off within a day was one that we ended up not tying any cables to at all . The kiosk was at room temperature the entire time , and the mounts were n't supporting much of the cables ' weight at all . One of the mounts only had one thin/flat computer power cord tied to it . The really bad thing is that is was n't even the adhesive that failed . When the mounts came off , each one left its square of adhesive still stuck to the metal . The adhesive on each mount had separated from the little thin later of white foam rubber , which was still attached to each of the plastic mounts lying in the bottom of the kiosk.I found a tiny logo on one of the left-over GOOD mounts we had , which turned out to be made by Panduit who I 'm familiar with . Even though the Panduit cable tie mounts are 6-7 times the cost of these Startech mounts , I 'm ordering some of those now since I need the mounts to actually stay in place for a few years - not just a few hours . If all you 're doing is sticking up a mouse cord to the underside of a desk or something , then these HC102 's might work , but I would n't count on it .	-1
i ordered these because i had read some reviews that claimed they produced high quality sound for this style of headphone . the price was ok , the order process was smooth and they arrived on time . unfortunately , i really dislike their sound and do n't use them . only the manufacturer and the reviewers are to blame .	-1
I got this because the studs I used to use would always fall out when I went on a run or a bike ride . Little did I know that the wire connects to the left ear piece that then sends another wire to the right ear piece . Major fail . Someone was n't thinking when designing this headset . It 's extremely annoying to wrap up and store anywhere . It always get tangled and is a pain to unwrap and wear ... To make matters worse , when it 's on , it actually starts to hurt my ears after about 15 minutes . Maybe I have big ears or maybe it 's just too tight of a hard plastic build , I ca n't decide ... also , when I had it on during my bus ride home I 'd have to turn the volume up because my bus is n't the quietest ride which would be okay except that everyone around me can then also hear what I listen to ... I would have loved some more noise canceling or a less public listening experience at higher volumes ... ( like with my ear buds ) Now , I only keep these in my work out bag in case I want to use it on the treadmill or for a run . I definitely would NOT get these as my primary pair of headphones .	-1
Unfortunately , even after unscrewing the protective heads , these cords/tips are so bulky they could not be plugged in on any TV I own or that my parents own , and I had to return the product . I would recommend buying a different brand ; the other set of cords I bought worked just fine .	-1
This is a very good cable signal splitter and it is easy to set up . However , I learned yesterday from a Comcast Cable technician who came to fix a cable box that could n't communicate that it passes too wide a frequency spectrum for Comcast Cable.Comcast only uses frequencies up to 1 GHZ for its video services . The technician said that allowing signals up to 2.5 GHZ to pass through allowed interference to pass from one connected device to another . That interference , as well as some incorrect cable connections in the house , turned out to be the reason why the Comcast HD cable box could not communicate properly with Comcast 's servers ( it could n't get an IP address ) . In any event , a good quality splitter that cuts off at 1GHZ is what one needs if Comcast is your cable provider .	-1
this product does normalize the audio as advertise but it also introduces some significant artifacts . i can heard severe popping noises when i watch movies with high dynamic range audio . it 's very annoying . i ended up not using this product.i know everyone is extremely irritated from uneven audio butt he only sound solution is buy an audio receiver with some audio normalization feature . it 's expensive but there 's no other option . good luck everyone .	-1
The standard FM/AM reception is decent on this radio and it 's size is convenient but I have yet to find a weather station on it . Maybe it 's just me . I 'm going to try another brand .	-1
Nice size portable radio . Reception poor with a lot of FM band overlapping . Tune for one station get 2-3 overlaping . Battery door broke within 2 weeks of use . Biggest complaint is the ear bud jack that within 1-2 months of use I get either right or left side of stereo sound and not both at once . And I have to keep moving the jack to get one side . I tried 2-4 different ear buds & head sets to no avail . You ca n't get to the plug in socket to fix without damaging the radio . This is the same problem I have had with other portable Sony radio products . Needest to say , I am not buying another Sony portable radio . Oh , at least the belt clip has n't broken yet , even though it keeps slipping off my belt .	-1
I loved this when i got it for xmas 2003 -- then about a year later , the trouble started.. i had many problems hotsynching with my mac at work , finally worked that out , and then the battery must have been running by being in my purse ( the joystick must have been pressed in ) and i lost everything on my palm . i had backed up fairly recently and was able to convert alot of my info back on to the unit ... then the fun really started ! some phantom appeares to be playing with my palm , i will hear click click click and it will be in a loop of toggling beetween functions , or in the calandar it will highlight an event over and over again , and i can not get it to stop . I will turn it off and turn it on , and still the same issue - we did a restart and now it is unusable- the stylus will not respond and it just clicks all over and it is a waste.I am sad because i really enjoyed the camera function and used it a lot for quick pics to friends and family via email of things that were new in my life.i will have to find a new pda , and i do not see myself getting another one of these , beware ! ! !	-1
This is an over time review . I bought this item 4 years ago . What I have to say now could have also applied 4 years ago , so here goes . I needed a cassette recorder to do a music project recording old 78 rpm discs . ( records ) I can also assume ( to be charitable ) that I received either a factory reject , or an item that was used before , returned , then re- sold as new , I do n't know . So here goes . This item will record and play back . The only thing is ( based on my Sony TCM-22DV ) for recording music , this sucks . I got a very annoying overdub of what I can only describe as motor noise overshadowing the recording . Also , when hooked up to my PC , for example , using a 3.5 mini cable from headphone jack ( PC ) to mic ( Sony recorder ) , if you touch/move the Sony , the tape reels will STOP . ( while the music plays ) . This is unacceptable . My solution was to go and buy a vintage Pioneer full size 1970 's tape deck . Now , THAT works . ( as long as belts hold out ) I do not believe that companies still produce good quality cassette recorders today , since they are a dead , ( or at least dying ) media system . My Sony 200DV is only good for punting into the trash can .	-1
In over 10 years of networking computers I have never purchased anything but Linksys products . From wired routers and NICs to wireless units it has always been Linksys . I will never buy another Linksys product now . I purchased this router to replace another Linksys router that lasted about a year . This one is less than a year old and I have to reboot it about every 45 minutes to an hour . The network monitor shows that I am connected at 54 Mbps and my signal strength is excellent and yet I am unable to access the internet , email , or other computers on the network . Tech support 's only suggestion was to upgrade the firmware and that seems to be what they tell everyone . Since that failed to fix the problem they have no other suggestions other than find my receipt to see if it was still under warranty . Do n't they keep a list of serial numbers and when they were sent out ? I assumed incorrectly that I purchased a quality product and therefore did not keep the receipt . I will not make that mistake again . All in all I wish I had read the customer reviews before I bought this POS . As a side note I had to reboot the router once before this message would go out . I wish there was an option to rate items at ZERO stars .	-1
If you are buying this for the 802.11a do n't bother . After fighting to get it even working with factory defaults I finally got it up and running . Then I opened port 80 on my firewall and the router crashed and I had to hard reset it . Once I finally got it to connect agian I could not enable WEP . Once you enable WEP on the 802.11a network the network stops broadcasting . So long as all you want out of it is factory defaults you may be ok.The product basically does not work at all for 802.11a .	-1
Worst product I have ever bought - it has never worked - sent it back to Linksys 5 times - supposedly to get a new unit - none ever worked - I wo n't even try to sell it on ebay because it would ruin my reputation - I sent it back to the head of Linksys as a gift . I just wish he was forced to use it and waste as much time as I have with it .	-1
I ordered this bridge based on the product manual on the Linksys web site , stating that the bridge supported WPA-PSK TKIP encryption ( I see that a firmware update to version 3 of this bridge supports WPA2 Personal/Enterprise ) . The problem was that Amazon shipped an old , obsolete hardware version of the bridge that supports only WEP . I have no interest in WEP . It is a weak , broken encryption scheme . This old bridge has no business being sold as new in 2007.This product is also overpriced . One can get a Buffalo WLI-TX4-G54HP Ethernet Converter for about $ 65 , and the Buffalo also comes with 4 LAN ports . You 'd have to spend additional money for a 4-port switch to get the Linksys equal to the feature set of the Buffalo.If zero stars had been allowed , I would have given that rating to this product , although Amazon also deserves a lot of the blame for still selling this obsolete junk . At least Amazon customer support came through and covered the return shipping . Kudos there .	-1
Works great at first ! But just over a year later ... it bit the dust . Hmm ... . ironic ... . the Warranty only covers the first year . I would have thought I just recieved a bad one , but then I was over at a friends house , and we wanted to watch a movie , but his RF modulator stopped working a few weeks prior . Low and behold ... same exact model and same exact symptoms . The red light turns off after being plugged in for 1 second . If you want something that will last for less than a year , get this , otherwise , get something other than RCA .	-1
The option of having everything plugged in at once is very appealing , but this modulator was not the answer for me . It introduced extreme video & # 34 ; noise & # 34 ; and I was n't able to find a location for it where this did n't happen . I had to go back to my old Radio Shack model , which requires me to switch wires whenever I switch devices but at least does the job and without interference . Love Amazon 's return policy !	-1
THIS PICTURE IS WHAT I CALL : & # 34 ; MISLEADING ADVERTISING ! & # 34 ; - THE BUTTONS ARE NOT ON TOP AT ALL ! - THEY 'RE ALL & # 34 ; IN & # 34 ; THE SIDE OF THIS BOX ...

IN THIS PHOTO ! - SO BEWARE !	-1
It is not the advertised product	-1
OK hardware with a limited & unreliable driver . No customer service . I strongly recommend AGAINST the purchase of this remote.Full review : I am a professional software developer . I purchased this product to control a media PC running Beyond TV ( on a dedicated Windows XP system ) . Key selling points were that the product advertised specific support for Beyond TV and also Girder ( promixis.com ) advertises support of the remote.Initial impression was moderately favorable . The remote is packaged with a driver CD . A quick web-site check showed the CD to be current . The remote installed ok and immediately worked with Beyond TV.Then I started checking the supported functionality and found that several Beyond TV functions were not supported . No problem I thought ... I 'd assign these functions to one of the 4 colored buttons at the bottom . Unfortunately , you ca n't even assign a keystroke to one of these . The driver supports only a limited , fixed , set of actions - and does n't include the most obvious one - typing a keystroke.Then came the driver problems . After everything looked OK , I left the PC and came back later . The remote no longer functioned . The red indicator on the receiver flashed ( nice feature ) but no action was taken on the PC . I tried to restart the supporting software with no success . Reboot of the PC clears the problem.It seems that after a period of inactivity , the driver will go into a processing loop . On my dual-core machine , it maintains a steady 27 % while in this state . Others postings on the net have confirmed this problem.I 've contacted their support - no phone number - only email . Other than an automated confirmation email , no response after 3 days . ( Other users have reported the same . ) Bottom line - the hardware seems OK , but the driver is unacceptable . Even if the driver did n't get stuck , the limited , hard-coded functionality provided is weak ( at best ) .I strongly recommend AGAINST this remote .	-1
I used two Celestron Omni 6mm 's and one Meade 6.4mm eyepieces for comparison using my Celestron 70mm Travel Scope . For looking at a star , there is a slight difference ; the Meade has a little less distortion - small spikes that radiate from the star as you closely focus . BUT , when looking at terrestrial landscape , which I do a lot , the Meade has much less distortion ( almost none ) between the edges and the center . The Meade has much better field of vision and slightly better eye relief . These differences would show up when looking at the moon or sun ( with filter ) . Even though they are both Plossel eyepieces , there is a definite design / quality that makes the Meade a better eyepiece . The difference in magnification is pretty much negligible .	-1
Returned the first one because the optics wer not aligned . Basically it was cross-eyed . The replacement was better but the focus adjustment ( pin ) sheared on the fouth time using the binoculars . Now there is no focus unless you can slide the eyepieces out just right to simulate the focus action . This rarely works and the eyepieces generally just fall out.On the bright side , it LOOKS impressive sitting on the window sill looking out over the water . Just dont touch it , like an antique telescope .	-1
I bought these binoculars because of the great reviews . Living in Costa Rica it is very difficult to return things or I certainly would . In addition to the knowledgeable review written by M.M . Vance regarding collimation ( which make my binoculars worse than useless ... they make you dizzy ) , I will add that the binoculars are extremely uncomfortable . The light shields around the eye pieces are very hard and do n't flex into your eye socket . You can fold the shields out of the way , but then you ca n't block side light . The binoculars are heavy and basically useless without a tripod even if they were n't out of cullimation . The rubber protectors for both ends of the binoculars do n't fit . The small protectors to cover the eye pieces do n't even closely fit and you have to push them out of shape to make them `` fit '' . The covers that protect the objective lens fall off if you just shake the binoculars lightly in your hands . Not a good purchase at any price !	-1
Absolutely to big . It 's good for a man , but very awkward for the average woman . Never could get to focus .	-1
Binoculars seemed great but when I looked through the eye pieces , the view was not synchronized , I saw two uncorrelated views.Returned and Amazon credited me the day I sent back the package .	-1
Poor quality optics but that 's pretty much what I expected for the price . The real problem is that after a few uses , the attachment from the focal adjustment to the left lens came off , tried fixing it but not successful . Attractive price but bad value . Stay away .	-1
While these look like nice binoculars , mine arrived with a screw floating around inside one of the oculars . Not surprisingly , it also had loose parts wiggling around inside . What happened to quality control ?	-1
works for a few hours , than kicks off wifi and you have to reset to get it to work again . not worth the money even if it was free .	-1
It was described as refurbished but it was simply re-packaged . The Ethernet activity light never came on so I presume there was a problem in the circuit board . It 's annoying that someone would send a defective unit , call it refurbished and then I had to go through the trouble of returning it at my own expense.Note : I have finally replaced my TWC modem with a Surfboard that I acquired elsewhere and have no problems . My beef is with the seller who must have known it was broken and it cost me double shipping : - (	-1
These FM tuners must be quirky little things and highly dependent on local conditions . All I can say is I could not receive any of the local FM stations I wanted to listen to in the middle of Washington , D.C. nor the nearby suburb of Arlington , Va. , not using the stock headphones nor my good Sony earbuds . Not on the regular or & quot ; city & quot ; sensitivity setting . Bah ! Back to Amazon with these .	-1
The radio broke only after a few months of normal indoor use at the gym ( 8-10 hours per week ) . Some of the preset buttons stopped working first . Soon thereafter , the unit just stopped working completely . Very disappointed with the purchase .	-1
I was plesantly surprised at the sound quality of these headphones . It is rich and full and you can pick out a lot of different insturments across the tonal spectrum . They perhaps do not look the best and do not have the best comfort . But well worth 5 stars for the price . I am going to be using them at work , and they were an excellent choice.Update 11/17 . My original review I have left intact above . A couple of weeks ago these developed crackling , then one side went out entirely . In spite of multiple efforts , that side has remained in-operable , hence the new 2 star rating . I wanted to leave the above review here , because , any product is capable of having some that end up not working for long . But for most of the products I buy that is not my experience . So I wanted to update what happened with mine and for whatever it is worth that was my exprience with the smallest possible sample size of 1 .	-1
We bought these to use for the family room TV so teenagers could play games or watch videos without all the noise . These headphones sound OK , but the construction is very flimsy- headband broke in 3 weeks . Sony wireless phones have more robust construction and lasted for several years in the same application before being moved to a different room . We 're goong back to the Sonys .	-1
I was considering this or a T5 after my T3 died within the warranty period as I needed someting to work with while waiting for repair . In December 04 I sent the T3 in for repair after talking with support . It came back within 7 days ! However I soon found that Palm sent the same T3 back to me unrepaired with no explanation.Back to support calls again , they say to send it in again . They get it on January 24th . I get no notification they have it . ( Glad I sent it Fed Ex to check delivery ! ) I call mid February and am told it will ship Feb 23 . It is now March 15 and no T3 and no word from Palm . The so called repair status on thier website which is supposedly updated hourly has not changed since 1/25/05.Tried calling again today and after a 15 minute wait was hung up on . I emailed , so will see what they say now . My T3 has been out of service for over 3 months . I went switched to Pocket PC in January . This was my second Palm , I was a big Palm supporter - not any more . I advise not to buy Palm unless you can afford to buy a new one if it dies within a few months .	-1
This WOULD be a great product . Bright screen , powerful fast processer , loads of memory . But The first one I bought had the wireless fail in 6 hours , the second in about 5 days . Quite frustrating to have your system all set up nice and then have the wireless die . After all , WIFI is the reason to buy this unit for the price you have to pay . Steer clear of this one for now . I returned my second for a refund rather than an exchange . Its a shame , because everything else is bluetooth and this would be the one to get for wifi .	-1
I have a Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 200 , 21 '' CRT . I needed to get farther away from my monitor . I bought this cable , because Cables To Go is supposed to be a good brand name . I bought UXGA because I run at least 1024x768 and higher at 75-100 hertz . This cable would not take the load over the distance of 15 ' . My monitor 's colors ended up being a bluish tint and if I tried to go over 1024x768 it got much worse . My monitor was dim and ugly looking and adjustments did n't help . I put it back the way it was and it 's great once again . I have a new system and a very good video card , so I know it 's this junk cable . Maybe on a small 15 '' - 17 '' CRT it might work or maybe on a small LCD , but it 's junk when it comes to my 21 '' CRT . Maybe someone who does n't know about Monitors and never really looks at the screen would think it 's great , but for a photographer , it 's a junk cable.I threw it out instead of dealing with returns ... ...	-1
I bought this adapter so that I could use an older PS2 keyboard with a Dell Inspiron notebook that only has USB slots . I plugged it in , and the keyboard worked for a few hours . But then I started to have problems . Sometimes all of the keyboard lights flash ( caps lock , num lock , etc ) , and the keyboard stops responding . Or else it will suddenly turn on the caps lock , or it acts as though the shift keys are being held down . I also found some odd behavior with my web browser while I had it plugged in . I unplugged the adapter and the problem went away . I have gone through this same cycle 3 times now . So although most people seem to have had success with this device , it did n't work for me .	-1
if you need this product in order to connect it to a switch view ( KVM ) it did not work , the mouse was not recognizedalso if you have a USB mouse and a convertor ( USB to PS2 ) it is not working , it did not recognize the mouse , I had to directly connect the mouse , disconnect it ( after driver was installed ) and connect throught the adapter , and it worked until the next boot , this is not a problem of the mouse or windows , when the usb mouse connected to the PS port directly ( throught the USB/PS2 adapter ) it worked , only when the adapter ( splitter is in use it wont work )	-1
I bought this card hoping it would be better than an & quot ; inferior & quot ; NVIDIA AGP card with less memory . The Radeon 9800 Pro AGP 128 MB was a big disappointment . Compared to the much cheaper NVIDIA card which came with my 1+ year old system , the colors are washed out and there is no noticeable performance improvement while watching DVDs . If you 're a gamer , perhaps this card has features that you can appreciate . However , I 've managed to find lots of posts on web forums from gamers who have had difficulty making their 9800 Radeon Pro AGP 128 MB cards meet expectations . The possible solutions that are flown in reply are extremely technical and complex and do n't seem to work . Unless you 're an expert , steer clear of the 9800 Radeon Pro AGP 128 MB .	-1
The volume control stopped working quite soon - works in certain positions only . The soft covers deteriorated very quickly . Two stars for a relative comfort .	-1
I bought this to use with my Skype ( free internet phone service ) . I had high expectations and was happy with the low price . This product turned out to be horrible . After a couple months , three problems:1 . Only the right ear of the headset is working now,2 . The little volumn control thing is bad , it does not change volumn smoothly and you have to carefully turn it to some specific place for it to make the right noise.3 . Connection to the computer not good . I have to press down on the connector with my fingers to hear anything.DO NOT BUY THISI am editing this review , because this pair of earphones just completely went broke on me . I am angry ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I 've owned this headset for about two hours . On the first plug-in and use , it worked tolerably well , though the output from my microphone ( tested by calling Skype ) was rather low ) . I 've changed nothing setting-wise , but 60 minutes later , both the headphone and microphone quality are getting worse . Definitely a piece of junk . Very sorry I wasted money on it .	-1
I bought the Belkin F5D7230-4 a few weeks back when I bought a new Dell inspirion 600m with Intel Centrino 1.5 GHz.Though the setup was easy ( nothing great because all routers are easy to set up ) . But I found that router kept dropping my connection every few minutes . I finally called Belkin support and they told me that Belkin routers have an issue with some Intel processors.The tech support told me to call regular customer service . When I did , Customer Service said that even if there was a problem ( notice they did n't deny it ) it should have been fixed by now.FINAL VERDICT : Save your money . Buy Netgear or Linksys routers . If you still want to buy Belkin and if your laptop has intel chips it will be a good idea to call Belkin customer support and verify if that particular router supports your particular processor . Also keep the receipt of your router in case you have to return it to the store . Remember , Belkin will NOT refund your money .	-1
I 'm really beginning to wonder why computer manufacturers seem to think it 's OK to push this junk out on us to waste countless hours of our time before returning it . Another day shot . This is nice and stylish , but like others complain , the connections suck -- and I even paid full price . Unless it is in the same room ( 8 feet away ) , forget it . Mine is downstairs ( maybe 10 feet away but through the floor ) , and I consistently get 4 or 5 bars in XP , but it takes several minutes to connect if at all and frequently drops after a few minutes . For example , it dropped during the few minutes to write this review , and I will be long done writing it before it reconnects . Ironically , my computer keeps connecting to my neighbors Netgear box next door even though it is only 2 or 3 bars . But , he is not using encryption . Maybe the encryption hoses this products ability to connect . Also , the firewall/DHCP feature set is utterly primitive , so I configured it only as an access point . One last problem is that it fails to boot with my real firewall ( SonicWall ) on the same network , so this requires another unplug and reboot . At least the firmware is more stable than the D-Link product which I am also wasting my time returning . Next up is probably LinkSys , but they get even worse reviews and the older blue ones do n't even support WPA . Is it too much to ask that a product works for even a few hours ? ( P.S . 8 failed connection retries to submit this review -- all 5 bars before I gave up and used my neighbors ' router . )	-1
Very troublesome to install on Mac . the security features involve unnecessary complications as well . keeps logging of the net and disconnects every once in a while	-1
Only the older Broadcom based ones are worth dealing with since you can put custom firmware on them .	-1
Buy this router if : a . You are a network engineerb . You wrote the setup softwarec . You plan on being luckyd . Your life is so dismal that a weekend spent chatting with the nice ladies in Hyderabad is the best you can hope for !	-1
I went ahead and spent the extra $ 500 bucks based on the Nikon reputation for a reliable quality product which could be used in the field for years to come . After a little over 6 months of pampered use , the autofocus on this lens just stopped working altogether for no apparent reason . Being the first Nikon product I have owned , I was not impressed . The image quality however was quite nice and very wide at 12mm . I never experienced any vignetting , but lots of flare when pointed anywhere near the sun . I got the auto focus fixed under warranty and ended up trading it in for a little over $ 500 dollars considered in EX+ condition . So I 'm learning . I 'm done wasting my money on overpriced equipment . Unless you are independently wealthy or get free gear from Nikon I would get a Tokina or Sigma instead . If anything good comes out of this , it is that I used this lens in trade toward a Mamiya RB67 body and back , which looks like is going to be a lot of fun : ) enjoy .	-1
I own 3 of these units already , and needed a fourth for the same application . The units ( new original its replacement ) that I received did not function in my application ( no power provided ) . I have two Raspberry Pi 's powered by this same model hub . The output of the older units ( two purchased within the last year from the same source ) is sufficient to stably power the Pi , a 2TB WD My Passport , and the network connection , plus a USB flash drive . This saves space , cost and the need for an extra outlet . A USB to micro USB cable is placed in one of the four ports and the other end into the Pi to power it . The USB stub cable is connected to one of the Pi 's USB ports . The old ones work great like this . Unfortunately , when the new unit was used in the exact same application , the hub would not light or power the Pi ( even without anything else - like the 2TB drive ) . After going through the effort to take a 2nd item , I was treated to a deduction of the shipping charge for the 2nd one , but did n't find out until after I placed a $ 100.00+ order including a different USB hub at a higher price since no exchanges or credits were permitted . Here comes the Grinch .	-1
I purchased these headphones because I needed a cheap , silent alternative to my computer speakers . These headphones looked like they had quality and they did sound alright . My problem with these headphones is that after a few hours of gaming while wearing these , my ears would become extremely sore , almost as if I had hung a huge weight on my ears . It kind of felt like someone was trying to tear my ears off after two hours or so . When headphones become this uncomfortable , they become very noticeable . When they get this noticeable , they are more of a pain than a joy to use , literaly . The price for looking cool with these & quot ; street style & quot ; headphones is not only whatever you pay for them , but also excrutiating pain comming from the tops of your ears .	-1
The headphones deliver good sound and seal off the ambient noise almost completely . Unfortunately after a very short time the cheap plastic band broke off next to a hinge , and the cord started fraying next to the plug . I would not recommend it .	-1
fause advertisement.They claim to be & # 34 ; studio & # 34 ; quality B.S.I have a very old pair I bougt -SONY-MDR-55 Not over the ear and they sound SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER ! I JUST WISH I COULD FIND EARPADS FOR THIS PAIR1	-1
Well I bought these 71 's because of the sound quality I read about during the opinions . I planned to use these for my MTB rides and around town . Well when I got them they worked like a champ - at least for the first few months ... then I noticed something happening to the wire 's jacket near the buds - they were turning dirty and softer than the surrounding jacket further down the wire.A few weeks later the jacket was stretching and looks now like it wants to peel off the inner wire ! That is the bad side of the earbuds from SONY.THe only good thing I can report is that the sound is the best for the price and they fit my small ear canal . I have bought others and they do not fit as well than SONYs ... but with this very major issue with the wiring jacket peeling away from the wiring , I am staying away from SONY.Going to try out the V-moda Bass Freq . The cost is similar to the SONYs , I just hope that the wiring jacket last longer than Sony 's .	-1
These broke on me after just two weeks and I therefore wasted $ 50 on headphones with just average sound . The problem is with the very thin wires . I never pulled them out by the wire , mostly just listened to them in bed at night - yet in such a short time the right headphone stopped working . Sony must consider this to be a disposable product , it certainly was not made to last . I was trying to save some money , but should have gone with Shure . Sony customer service was of no help to me by the way , nor was Amazon .	-1
I purchased these headphones for their ability to block outside sounds during my commute . While they are good at this , the sound they produce is terrible . There is way too much bass -- you actually feel the physical pressure on your eardrum with every beat . At the same time , midrange and treble are very muffled . There is also noticeable interference between bass and treble -- whenever there is a bass beat at the same time as vocals , the vocals fade out and distort for the duration of the beat . Compared with the crispness of the standard iPod earbuds , everything sounds as if you 're underwater.With that said , when I set the equalizer in iTunes in a steep stairstep pattern , reducing bass and increasing treble , the sound was great . Unfortunately , custom equalizer settings do not transfer over to the iPod ( regardless of what model you have ) , and none of the preset equalizer settings come even close to making the sound acceptable . So while these headphones might work with an MP3 player that supports custom equalizer settings , they are useless with an iPod . Bottom line : If you at all like the sound of the earbuds that come with the iPod , even if you wish they had more bass ( as I do ) , these headphones are not for you . ( And if anyone knows of a pair of in-the-ear headphones that have clear mids , detailed highs and are n't so biased in favor of the lows , write me at [ ... ] )	-1
Comfort is tops , but I think I would go so far as to say the specs for this headphone are a lie . On none of the several players I use is there any change whatsoever ( contrary to other phones ) in the sound with changes in EQ ( likewise for Koss ' similar pair , by the way ) -- that 's telling me that bass and treble are beyond the scope of what these can reproduce , and that 's what my ears are telling me , too . Transparency is lacking , as well.They 're much cheaper , and I know they do n't have the glamor , but Sony 's MDR-W08L phones deliver more sound for the $ $ $ , though not at the same comfort level . I keep looking for ( and buying ) sealed in-ear phones that promise deliver better sound than the MDR-W08L for anything like a reasonable price , and I have n't found them yet . Look , the MDR-W08L costs peanuts -- Sears has them for seven bucks in their stores . Buy a set and use them for comparison -- see if you do n't agree that they 're hard to beat . These are n't the ones .	-1
Bought this product along w/ matching auxiliary battery pack BR24BP based on APC 's Selector - an online app which asks about your equipment then recommends the products you should consider . The Selector gave me bad advice for my MacPro . I was never able to completely ascertain what the mismatch was about , but threads I found suggested it was either `` inrush current '' where a waking computer 's current needs spike momentarily OR something to do with this APC unit not producing a `` sine wave output . '' In any event , any time the APS unit was needed to step in due to an electrical outage , the waking of my sleeping Mac immediately overloaded the BR1500 and everything crashed . I returned this unit and replaced it with APC 's Smart-UPS 1500 and have never had another issue . Bottom line : APC 's Selector needs an overhaul . The two stars are n't meant to say the BR1500 is necessarily a bad product , but rather that its suitability to task was NOT what the Selector said it was .	-1
The DVDs I burned successfully showed the movies in excellent quality . The only problem is that for every 3 good burns I get one bad one . I 'm using the Plextor DVD burner ( love it ! ! ) , but I 'm going to try my luck with a different DVD brand . The failure rate for Memorex is unacceptable . It 's less the cost that bothers me , but more the time wasted on burning coasters .	-1
This is very low quality media . The quality can even differ from each individual disk , instead of per batch like with most disks . A lot of my burns do n't end up having proper quality . Sure , they burn fine , and may even work for the average user , but the quality is very low . I now know why the price was so low . My recomendation is to find some TDK or Verbatim media equivalent , which may have the same Media Code in the ADIP & quot ; RICOHJPNR01 & quot ; , but it is of much higher quality . Try to avoid Memorex media as much as you can .	-1
I was disappointed in this pack of blank CD 's . I have been buying this brand for years and always happy to use them , but this time they kept saying put another disc in when I tried to record . I thought maybe they were DVD 's so I tried one in a friend 's DVD recorder and the disc just did n't work.Maybe they were a defect . Sorry I tried at least 8 and each I threw away.I hope the next ones they may have will be as great as they always have been before this pack.Most of my reordings of music and pictures are on Memorex CD 's . I do n't hold a grudge towards this seller.I 'll try them again . Maybe they have new ones this time .	-1
Sound quality is ok at low volumes but speakers `` rattle '' as you turn up the volume . Bought them for both my notebook computer and cd player . Batteries go dead really fast when turned off . Very short speaker cable ( 3 ft ) . Not worth the price !	-1
What can I say . Poor piss performance from western digital again and again . This drive was in a server ( temperature controlled env ) and failed 6 days after the 1 yr warranty expired . Didnt loose the data due to raid ... but 1 year ... gim me a break . Seagate 5 yr warranty seems like the way to go . NEVER BUYING WD again .	-1
Then noticed it was the first thing that came up ... .Im not going to waste my time going through a long list of '' why nots '' when it comes to this winder.Lets just go with this , INSANELY slow ! and occasionally eats tape ! Those are the 2 things I want LEAST in a rewinder.If there was a zero star option , I would of taken it !	-1
I was a bit disappointed in this item . The rewind button will not stay locked when rewinding . You have to hold it in place in order to rewind it . Cheaply made . : (	-1
This made-in-china thing is a junk . When I first opened the box I saw 2 things : 1 ) The tripod bag has huge scratch looked like it 's a used goods or what , 2 ) Few fractions dropped down of which I found out later they ware parts of a turning knob . I uploaded pictures of both damages . I know I paid not expensive for this thing but as I buy something , I do expect some quality in return . This product is a pure piece of junk !	-1
This tripod is made of very cheap materials . Feels like its going to break any minute . Plastic is super cheap . Everything moves , even when `` locked '' in place .	-1
Overall for the price this thing costs its great . I would probably give it 5 stars even though its not the best quality.I 'm only giving it one star because mine does n't sit perfectly strait . It does n't matter how sturdy or how many features or whatever this thing has if all my pictures are tilted to the left by a few degrees ... . Yes I know how to adjust it , but the adjustment is already at its maximum .	-1
I would not put my camera on this tripod . It is very flimsily constructed , the center pole regularly comes disconnected , the handle for raising the top bar appears like it will fall off any day . I would not recommend this product . The only use I could have for this would be using this as a table tripod , and not risk damaging my camera or speedlite .	-1
Of all the DVD players I 've ever owned this is the worst . It continually skips and freezes . The progressive scan capability fails on most DVD 's . I have owned various players over the years and this is the only one that has failed so miserably.I contacted Philips to see about having it replaced and have received the worst service imaginable . It is apparent they do n't care about quality.If you want a good DVD player I recommend going with Toshiba instead .	-1
The in-ear headset is way too BIG to fit into my ears . Extremely uncomfortable . It is a size of a nickle of hard shell.No sound isolation .	-1
Used them while working out . Spent more time pushing them back in my ears . Base response good , OK product , but not for me . I bought Koss `` Sparkplug '' ear headphones , they are outstanding .	-1
This item is way over priced . Other audio plugs sell for around $ 4 from Amazon , this Sony plug sells for $ 7 , and the Monster plug sells for $ 14 . `` It 's a Sony '' . Nah , I do n't buy that marketing slogan . At monoprice.com , it sells for $ 0.39 for 1 if you buy 1 , product ID 7139 , and only $ 1.83 shipping cost.I plugged this into my CD player with an iPhone 5 headphone and I did n't know what was happening as the voice sounds were in the background and the musical instrument sounds were much louder . So I pulled out just the headphone jack and plugged it into my Audinst DAC unit and it seems fine . I tried it on the CD player again and the same thing . As I was pulling it out , I get the full sound . With this Sony audio plug , you have to wiggle it to get the correct contact , which is totally unacceptable . I do n't believe my plug is a one time occurrence , but a design and/or manufacturing flaw on this item . Made in Taiwan if it matters to anyone .	-1
I ca n't remember if I posted a review for this back in January or not . Now it is December . I mostly used it for video games when family went to bed . It was n't exceptional and only sat 10 feet away . It would crackle during quiet times and range was garbage but it did okay . I recently used it for the first time with a movie and it was terrible . The hiss was constant and the audio was just bad . I feel the quality has also degraded some what with video games too . I am considering another newer sony headset but only because sennheiser 's are so expensive .	-1
I decided to go with these since they were infrared and I had hoped interference would not be an issue . Boy was I wrong . Maybe I have too much going on in back of my TV , but I could n't get these to work without a continual hissing in the ear piece . Seller did great , but I had to return .	-1
lasted 5 minutes , then quit on me , nothing but static now so a zero recommendment . Wish i hadnt gotten this thing .	-1
I liked the charger , the plastic and metal and how they sit . But they produced loud hissing noise even when not connected to a source . Maybe I just got defected item ... I had to return them .	-1
This product is useless . The TV screen generates enough light to majorly affect the infrared rays that are used to transmit the signal . As a result , total noise if you 're sitting in front of a large flat-screen TV ( 42 inches ) . Also , due to being infra-red it transmits only line of sight , so if anyone or anything comes in the way , instant noise and you ca n't hear a thing .	-1
The idea was great but the workmanship and parts can make any great idea a flop . After a week the battery charger stopped working in the headphone cradle . I expected better from Sony . Very disapointed .	-1
I was surprised that Sony of all names has this poor product . I would only be able to use them for a few minutes befor distortion would start then get worse then the headphones would just shut off from it . I was not moving and I was at most 3 or 4 feet from my tv and closer on other attempts to get it to work . There was no blockage between me and the transmitter and my tv and cable have no static noise without the headphones . Its worth spending more on a better qaulity headphones if you want quality .	-1
Bought two pairs and both went dead within 48 hours . One died within one hour of using it for the first time . In both cases , there was a loud electrical sound , like a slap over the ear , and the phones went dead . Sometimes they came back on in 5-10 minutes , sometimes they did n't . Very surprised since most of my experience with Sony products has been positive .	-1
I 've gone through two pairs of these earphones , both white and black versions and about 8 months through the right or left ear piece died out . Sony only gives you a 90 day warranty so you are out of luck when these things die on you . I decided not to go for three and saved up a few extra bucks and bought the SHURE E2g 's ( $ 100 but really amazing ) .I highly do not recommend these earphones . Please save your money and buy something better .	-1
it works , but it does n't work flawlessly . just like most of the other reviews say , this mouse makes for a jumpy cursor . one second your in the middle of the screen , the next your in the upper left corner . it 's only once in a while , but still annoying . go for a logitech instead .	-1
This is n't basic , it is n't functional - it 's a piece of junk . I talked to customer service , they finally said , `` take it back to the store '' . Look at all the reviews that say this thing skips all over your screen and believe them .	-1
Did I mention that this keyboard is flexy ? Way too flexy ? It is . Could n't use it . Sent it back . I do n't want to be annoyed while typing .	-1
Did not successfully link the Presonus Firestudio firewire 400 to the Macbook Pro firewire 800 . No problem with a firewire 400 connection to older Macbook ( FW400 ) . I have not tried others .	-1
I choose windows xp and it wo n't work on my win 7 puter , I do n't like it and wish I had not purchased it . do n't buy one for your private use .	-1
I think this is a very bad wireless mouse . It did n't work wireless for me even though I charged the battery for more than 4 hours according to the manual . So I had to connect the recharging cable with it all the time . That makes it a WIRED mouse ! ! ! The buttons on the receiver and mouse are so tiny that you have to use a pen or something to press it . The battery cover is hard to open . This mouse does NOT have a sensitive signal . The motion of the cursor lags behind your mouse . Terrible mouse ! ! !	-1
I bought this to experiment with recording meetings using my laptop . This microphone did n't seem any better than the built in laptop mic .	-1
Worked great until it broke . Had it for about 3 months , always handled it very carefully , but then it just stopped working right ... The audio it was picking was extremely faded/distorted/weird , and ultimately unusable . : (	-1
My never-ending search for a mic that does its job w/o feedback.I was looking for mics to use while skyping ( long distance relationship ! ) and blazed through a few mics that ended up not working very well . This was one of them . Worked well at first but died really quickly afterwards.I got & lt ; a href= '' http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MYPPPE/ref=as_li_ss_tl ? ie=UTF8 & camp ; =1789 & creative ; =390957 & creativeASIN ; =B000MYPPPE & linkCode ; =as2 & tag ; =talesfromthec-20 '' > Olympus ME-52W Noise Canceling Microphone & lt ; /a > & # 60 ; img src= & # 34 ; [ ... ] width= & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; height= & # 34 ; 1 & # 34 ; border= & # 34 ; 0 & # 34 ; alt= & # 34 ; & # 34 ; style= & # 34 ; border : none ! important ; margin:0px ! important ; & # 34 ; & # 62 ; instead .

I was able to install and configure this mic just fine . However , after about 5 minutes the quality degraded and eventually became un-usable . I could unplug the USB cable and re-plug and it began to work just fine . Yet , as before , after 5 minutes the quality degraded , began to sound `` `` staticy '' and eventually the audio faded away into complete static.I bought this through Circuit City . I was disappointed to see their terms of return as they asked that manufacturer be contacted to get their authorization to return it . I find these terms to be rather onerous and wrote them to let them know . I have yet to hear back from them . If I get a response , I will post the results here.UPDATE : I contacted Circuit City via Amazon Marketplace . They issued me a return authorization number . For that I am thankful . Thanks Circuit City ! Still , I am surprised by Logitech 's quality in this case . I always thought they made good products .	-1
I liked the quality this mic recorded at , but the volume was so low even right against the edge of the desk that I had to replace this with a clip-on . Later replaced that with the stationary mic on the Lifecam Studio for convenience , but did not enjoy this mic . Heard something about a defective batch but did not try soldering this mic .	-1
I have a standard issue Dell desktop , with the default AMD sound . Nothing fancy , but 3.5mm analog headset mics have always worked great for me . This mic , however , can not produce an acceptable level of volume . I tried multiple applications , but I always sounded like I was talking from the other side of the room.And here 's why you should n't buy this if you have a cheap sound card : I could not change the settings enough to compensate . I set my mic level to 100 ( max ) , but because I have a cheap sound card , there was no `` microphone boost '' option like I 've always seen for the analog mics.This mic possibly works great if your sound card can support it . Me , I went withCyber AcousticsStereo Headset/Microphone , Ambidextrous design AC-201because it 's analog , and it sounds just fine .	-1
I LOVE this microphone . But I 've been using this model for five years , and I am shocked at the price / availability.On 20 April 2014 , why is this microphone $ 70 ? ? I bought it in January for only $ 25 ! This is an OLD microphone , do not get ripped off with this ! Check eBay , you 'll get a much better price ! ( $ 20-25-ish )	-1
I Have a good 6-8 hours of effort into getting my brand new 15gb windows ipod to just have a playlsit work . The included MusicMatch software for PC is basically totally broken ( and this is confirmed by numerous posts on sites like ipodlounge.com ) . The standard advice is to go buy another program like xplay since the included software from Apple does n't work . The problem with the third party programs is that most have n't been updated to work with the latest crop of ipods . ... Not sure if this is apple 's way of suggesting that everyone buy a mac ... , but if you are a PC users I suggest looking elsewhere . I am very disappointed ... -H	-1
This is a load of crap . I got it as a christmas present.. and now it 's february.. so i 've only had this thing for 3 months . Well , at first it was all right and all.. but now it 's officially DEAD . I have yet to send it in to be repaired and i 'm not sure if i want to considering my dad paid so much for this skimpy thing that fails to deliver after only 3 months . I get tired waiting for songs to upload and furthermore , the battery life drains so fast . i started out w/ an ok battery ( the battery would go down one bar after about 30 songs ) to battery life of an imposter duracell bunny ( less than 20 songs and it 's down one bar ) well great , my ipod died completely when i tried to listen to it a few days ago . it 's not responding to snything . i see some ppl think it 's great and it has worked out well for them but i really think this is a hit-or-miss product . Either it works for you or it dies within a few months . I have heard other stories of people 's ipod dying within a few months and even though there 's a one-year warranty , the person still had to pay for some repairs . So buyers beware.. make sure you know what you 're getting yourself into ! Edit : I got a replacement ipod ... had to transfer all the songs over to it ... moreover , it just died again . So this stupid thing has died TWICE in less than SIX MONTHS .	-1
Going on a long flight or not near an outlet . This is handy , for its price . There are other recharges out there , but they cost double or triple the cost . AA batteries are easy to come by , so that makes this a good product . But turning it on is a chore . You better have a key or nail file near by . Sliding the switch on is a struggle . And when you do not need it , turn it off , otherwise the batteries will drain . It also does not snug completely to the 30GB . If your iPod is low on batteries , this will work in a pinch . But if the connection comes loose and the iPod batteries are low , the iPod will turn off without any notice . Also , the suction cups are not needed . Most people keep their iPods in some sort of protective barrier ( plastic or rubber ) . So the suction cups are a nuisance.If it snugged better and rested at the bottom ( like the other rechargers ) I would give it a 4 , a 5 if it lasted longer .	-1
I 've installed a lot of print servers in the past , mostly HP JetDirects . They all just work . This , on the other hand , is utter garbage . It is ridiculously difficult to set up , it crashes all the time , and never prints anything right -- on my laser printers and ink jets both , every printout comes out off-center or even running off the edge of the page . Avoid , avoid , avoid . I did n't even bother returning it for a return , I threw it straight into the e-waste bin . Yeah , it 's cheap , but save yourself the time and trouble -- this thing is nothing but abandoned orphanware ( has n't even had a firmware update for years , and does n't even mention Vista or MacOS 10.4 or above in its FAQ or online knowledge base ! ) that D-Link continues to sell only because they have a warehouse full of the things that they need to get rid of before they can `` officially '' discontinue it .	-1
Sounds like a great product , but the manual clearly states that printing is OS X requires postscript compatible printers . My inkjet is not postscript , so I have to return this . I wish this had been clearly written before I purchased .	-1
Tried for three hours to set up this print server . Called tech support -- 30 minutes on hold , hung up . I have a broadband connection through a Motorola Surfboard modem to a Netgear wired/wireless router . I want to be able to print through the router with my laptop 's wireless connection . With this print server , I could not even print from my desktop computer.Followed set up instructions to the letter , again and again . Not able to print through this server -- and , yes , I turned off all my firewalls and other security.Will return this server	-1
First the pros : Large ball feels very nice and scrolls very smoothly.The unit ( aside from the item mentioned below ) seems well made.The buttons have a nice positive click to them.Now on to the cons : I had to send mine back . The scroll wheel had something wrong with it . When it scrolled it felt like it was out of round and scratched and scraped around as it turned . Whereas my mouse feels like I 'm rolling a rubber wheel on glass , this felt like I was rubbing sandpaper on hard plastic . Reading the other reviews it turns out this may be by design ? ! Apparently it has to `` wear in . '' I really have a hard time believing that mine would ever `` wear in '' enough to be acceptable.That notwithstanding , the design on this trackball is really hard for me to understand . Now this is probably a matter of personal preference , so try one out yourself and see . The angle you have to hold your hand at to use this is terrible . My wrist started hurting almost immediately . I have a Logitech Trackman and it fits my hand perfectly . This was just really awkward to use . Even with the supplied wrist rest the angle of extension on my wrist is just to much for me.The large size of the ball combined with the inclination of the device places the top of the ball about 2.7 inches off the desk and about 1.2 inches above the part of the device where my hand rests ( with the pad installed ) . Without the pad my hand rests on the desk . To compare , the top of the ball on the Trackman sits about 1.5 inches from the surface of the desk and only about 3/8 of an inch above the part of the device on which the back of my hand wrests . This feels much more natural to me.Again , the caveat here is that this is one person 's opinion . I think a trackball is a very personal thing and it depends a lot on your own preference . However , all the research I 've done indicates that wrist extension and flexion are things you want to avoid . Your write should rest in a natural position as much as possible . I do n't see a way to accomplish that with this device .	-1
Bought this to replace a Logitech Trackman Marble . Plugged it in and went to the website to download the driver . I went to install it and I got an error message that it was n't compatible with my version of Windows . ( i have Windows7 64 bit ) although on the website it says it is . I contacted Support . They sent me an email asking for screenshots of the error message and my system info . I sent them and they replied thanking me for doing so . Well 3 weeks pass and not a word . So I returned this and just bought a new Logitech . Then a week after that they finally contact me telling me that since they have n't heard from me in 2 weeks they consider the problem SOLVED ! WHAT ? ? ? ? Plus they send another email to take a survey rating their service . I took the survey and told them the I solved the problem by returning it and i would n't buy another one of their products . Then a couple of days later I get ANOTHER email that they were updating the software in a few days so it should work then . Like I said in the title ... I 'm sticking with Logitech . ( Besides the button placement stinks on this anyway , IMO )	-1
Purchased the Slimblade model and have had no complaints . Purchased this model for a friend and it was nothing but trouble and was returned . Tried to install it on a computer running Windows 7 and first it would not work at all . Windows tried to download the appropriate software and was unable . The trackball works software , located at their homepage , would not download ( error messages such as unable to copy or unable to locate ) hence I was constantly getting multiple error messages , one atop another , and constantly being told to reboot the computer.I 'm not a tech . type , but I went into the program files found the related files and erased them and then tried the process again . No changes . Very frustrating . As mentioned product was returned .	-1
I know many on here love this trackball , so please do n't flame me . I bought this today and set it up . I was shocked at the flimsy , cheapy feel of the scroll ring , and of the motion of the trackball itself . I was not at all impressed , for 100 bucks . I 'm returning it .	-1
Basically this item comes down to the money to build ratio . For the steep price tag , you would expect the item to feel durable , smooth , comfortable , etc ... But really what you get is an awkward , rough , flimsy item.I have had the Logitech Marble Mouse for quite some time and love it ( although I would like a scroll wheel - hence why I got this guy ) . I am going back to the marble mouse , because this trackball after two weeks has just been awful . I figured it might just need an adjustment , but it really is not a quality item ( ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE TAG ) .The feel is awkwardly uncomfortable and it lacks vista+ drivers ( as many have noted ) . Other than swapping left-click/right-clicks , you are stuck with the defaults of `` middle mouse '' and `` back '' .The scroll wheel gets in the way here as you move the ball around - it gets rotated pretty easily . Also , the wheel is not a smooth glide or even slightly rough - it really does feel like you 're damaging it during use.Save the money and annoyance and get the Logitech Marble Mouse , they are getting rarer ( as trackball users are few ) - but they are great . Vista+ drivers , four button customizable , and if you want scrolling - you can customize a button to initial the scroll . Spend the extra 30+ bucks on some new ram [ well , until prices started rocketing ] .	-1
I got really excited about the four button feature but it does not work on vista . I can see that angle of the hand would have given me problems too .	-1
This company must be using cheaper parts . The buttons work okay and the ball . The wheel , however , that is supposed to scroll up and down is garbage . I had this product before and it was good , but it was 10 years old and not compatible with my new computer . I 'm extremely disappointed with this new trackball .	-1
WARNING ! ! ! Kensington does NOT support windows XP 64-bit ! You can not program the buttons or get full functionality under x64 and kensington has bluntly stated that they have no interest in supporting it . If you are a CAD user this hardware is obsolete , stay away ! That 's a shame , too , because I would otherwise rave about the ergonomics , the scroll ring ( though it is quite scratchy , even after a couple of years use at 45hrs/wk ) , and the convenience of programmable buttons.Disgraceful behavior from an otherwise top manufacturer.==Update 7-17-2013==I 'm still using this trackball at work . I 've had a piggyback driver work around in place for years in order to get three button functionality ( I ignore the fourth button ) , maybe Kensington supports Windows 7 x64 these days , maybe not . No failures or issues , its physically holding up like new after perhaps 14,000 hours of use . The scroll ring is still scratchy .	-1
recognize that less than stellar reviews are almost labeled as 'not helpful ' because people somehow take it personally that another person has disparaged some product that they want positive validation on . So be it . Here 's the honest review of the Expert Mouse nonetheless.For $ 80.00 , I 'm shocked . This is an incredibly cheapo feeling product . My purpose in going this route was to eliminate some growing wrist pain . I can already tell that a trackball is going to help ; but it wo n't be this trackball . My days are spent with Photoshop , InDesign , and a myriad other applications that demand extremely precise cursor and tracking accuracy . This trackball rests on tiny plastic/nylon bearings that either do not rotate or do so VERY poorly . All of which leaves the trackball to herky jerky around . Yes , there are extensive settings in the driver software to fine tune some the actions for your personal needs . But understand this very clearly , the fine tuning is meaningless because the actual mechanical workings of the ball are sooooooooo poorly designed . Both the ball itself and supposedly magnificent scroll wheel operate with the feeling and sound of grinding coffee . Overall the operation is typical of a mouse costing maybe $ 12.00 , not a penny more . I realize this is sad news for those of you really looking for a positive review . And believe me , I have reviewed things for Amazon very favorably , but for $ 80.00 this particular item is just very close to being as useless as it can be .	-1
After having used a mouse for hours a day for 10+ years , a bit of RSI/carpel tunnel ( I do n't know which ) had started to kick in . So I tried several other mice , and finally switched to a Logitech trackball ( Trackman Wheel Optical ) and that helped to reduce some of the stiffness and pain I was feeling , but it did not eliminate it . Plus , the vein just to the left of my thumb has enlarged significantly , probably due to all the thumb movement from moving the trackball around . So , I once again went looking for alternatives.I had been waiting to get one of these Kensington trackballs for awhile , but their software ( Mouseworks ) was not fully compatible with Vista or Win7 64-bit . So when I heard that they had released new software ( Trackballworks ) for 64-bit , I went ahead and pulled the trigger . I had a chance to try out both Mouseworks and Trackball works , and am sad to report that , although the Trackball works supports customizing all buttons ( as of May/June 2010 ) , it 's not quite as feature-rich as the older Mouseworks software . ( For example , you can no longer customize the buttons on a per-app basis , though they may add this capability back in at a future date . ) However , for those who know what AutoHotkey is , this is n't a huge problem , but does require you to get your hands a bit dirty with some scripting.But the real question is , how does it feel ? The ball comes out spinning kind of rough out of the box , but if you 've read many reviews of this trackball , you 'll know that the 'oils ' on your fingers will smooth it out pretty quickly , and that 's what happened with mine . However , I found the unit to be too big , as my hand has to do gymnastics to be able to use the ball and hit all the buttons , and it basically transferred the pain from my hand to my wrist . ( Trying with and without the included wrist rest did n't make much difference . ) I tried changing which buttons did what , but it did n't really help . Plus , it was taking me twice as long as with my Logitech trackball to do complex operations , such as selecting text while using the scroll ring to scroll the page . And trying to speed things up would put too much strain on my hand.However , other folks would tell you that this trackball ( and it 's cousin , the Slimblade ) is like the second coming , thus it 's really hard to gauge how the unit will fit in your hand , because hands come in different sizes , and these things are very subjective . ( My hands are of average size for a male ) . What feels great to one person will be very uncomfortable to another . The best advice I can give you is to try to find one locally and see how it feels in your hand . Barring that , I suppose you could always order one and return it if it does n't feel 'right ' to you.In the meantime , I am going back to my Logitech trackball , and maybe find another mouse or trackball that I can switch out every few hours . Unless somebody has any better ideas ? ( I make a living on my PC , so 'just using the computer less ' is n't really an option , unless I do n't want to eat . )	-1
I 've dealt with other switches before , but I have never seen a switch a loud at this monster . Only huge server farms go louder that the cacophony of this monstrosity of a switch.Linksys is definately going from worse to worser , which is a same because there used to be a level of quality at Linksys , but that seems less often than not these days .	-1
Based on a great many reviews that I have read both here and elsewhere on the net , it is my opinion that there is a manufacturer 's defect related to this unit . My DVD recorder worked perfectly ... until it died for no apparent reason . Called Panasonic and they told me to pound sand because it 's out of warranty.Something 's up with this item . I 've read way too many stories of similar failures . Panasonic ought to fix these for free before someone nails them with a class action lawsuit , in my opinion . As it is , I have little more than a Panasonic paperweight .	-1
This is a great product- We 've been using ours for over 5 years , and it 's totally changed the way we watch TV- The machine records our shows per the timer recording feature , and we watch them when we have time ( 3 kids ) , and we fast forward through all of the ads- BUT as of this January thanks to `` big brother '' looking out for our best interests , this thing is obsolete- The tuner is analog- Sure , you can put a converter in line , but the converter becomes your tuner- So , basically this unit is nothing but a hard drive / DVD player- No more programing the tuner for watching your favorite TV on your own schedule- Bummer !	-1
Sony used to be all I would purchase for AV equipment but the quality in recent years has taken a nose dive.This DVD player lasted slightly over 1 year and just abruptly died . the DVPNS715P it replaced also died shortly after 1 year.Do an internet search for Sony DVD players and you will find hundreds of complaints of premature failures due to the low quality components Sony now uses in their products.This was the last Sony product I will ever purchase	-1
At first , this seems like a good product ... brand name , ease of use , low cost . But if the battery goes dead , there are no replacements made anywhere and because this item is so old , Motorola no longer provides any form of warranty for this product.I bought this item from BuyJFGoods here on Amazon as a Christmas gift and it never worked because the battery was dead and would not charge.- as far as the item is concerned , do not waste your money on something that is so old that the manufacture does not cover any longer.- as far as BuyJFGoods is concerned , let 's see if they assist me with a refund where I do not have to pay return shipping since I paid for shipping to get it in the first place .	-1
I brought this product several days now an is unable to use it as the ports for the radio is different that what came on the item ...

I 've had the unit for about a year now and it has worked great . The software occasionally dropped out and the unit had to be restarted but after that it worked . Until microsoft automatically upgraded my machine to service pack 2 . Now the included software no longer scans my hard drive for tracks . The unit will connect to my pc and they talk but no music is listed in the server . neither are pictures.The software for the unit has not been updated in since 9/29/2003 . It does not look like they will ever upgrade the software either.If you have windows XP and you already have service pack 2 installed this unit will not function . Otherwise it 's a great piece of hardware . I do understand that some people have hacked a linux server together but that 's to much work to try and get up and running . I bought the netgear mp101 to replace it . I am hoping that one works better ...	-1
I used my manfrotto super clamp for years and loved it . However earlier today I was using it to clamp a 60 '' umbrella with two 580EXii flashes and PocketWizards on a Manfrotto 23 '' flexible boom arm to a bridge railing ( over the water ) for a portrait shoot . As I was adjusting the umbrella it seemed a bit loose and when I jiggled it the whole freaking contraption broke off at the 1/4 '' brass mounting stud ! Luckily I had the thing in my hand when it broke so I was able to catch it , but if I was not holding it that would have been about $ 1,800 of gear falling in the river . I am not sure , but I think the newer version of this clamp still comes with the same 1/4 '' stud , so be careful out there ! I am now switching over to the super clamp stud from my cowboy studio clamp . I do n't like the cowboy studio clamp quite as much as the manfrotto one , but I like the larger stud that comes with it a whole lot better ! I 'm still giving the manfrotto one two stars for the years of service , but I wo n't be able to trust this quite the same again .	-1
do n't waste your money on these quick releases . purchase ones from `` Really Right Stuff '' ( with head base plate ) and you will have the best in size , weight and usability . ) These are very clumsy to work with and there is better on the market .	-1
There is nothing to indicate that this bag is a Manfrotto . It is almost identical to theVidPro TC-27 Padded Tripod Bag , but three and a half times more expensive ! I know because I ordered one of those as well.I sent it back within minutes of opening it.It was cheaply made , the wrong size , the wrong color , and missing anything remotely related to Manfrotto.Not sure what 's up , but skip this bag till something gets cleaned up .	-1
These are okay meaning that if you have off camera flash , Sb 's on cannon ex 's they will do just fine . If you place Einsteins on them be ready to place sand bags for stabilization . They are not good for studio flash in my opinion .	-1
I thought that choosing where to set the tripod head ( horizontal , vertical and tilt ) all at one time would be a good but it is n't for me . Just as I would set the horizontal , then lossen it to set the vertical , I 'd lose the horizonal position . Totally exasperating . So I sent it back to get the 3-way head so I can set one direction at a time .	-1
I would have given it zero stars but that is not a choice . Here 's why:1 . Low load capacity . With a Canon 5D MkII and a moderately heavy lens ( still below the load capacity ) I experienced ball creep and have to tighten down the lock knob all the way every time.2 . Non-user friendly quick release lever . You have to push the button forward while pulling the level back . Not the easiest operation in the world.3 . QR plate too big . When mounted to the camera , it is always getting in the way.4 . Ca n't go all the way vertical . The size of the QR plate combined with the QR lever would interfere with the spirit bubble on my Manfrotto tripod preventing it from going all the way vertical.5 . The final straw . I was out shooting in the rain and the ball head got wet . Ever since , it started sticking even when the lock knob was loosened . This got worse to the point that I could not move the ball at all . So I tried some light lubricant ( WD-40 ) . This helped for about a day . So I tried another lubricant ( BoeShield T1 ) . Same result . Now nothing works and the ball is permanently stuck unless I tap the top of the QR plate thus releasing the metal ring below the ball that locks the ball in position . But as soon as I tighten the knob , it stays locked after loosening.Hopefully Manfrotto will replace it so I can sell it . I 'm now using a Kirk BH-1 and LOVE it .	-1
Purchased this as a Christmas gift and within weeks the thing started falling apart . First it was the internal zipper then other functions quit working , within a few months it was read for the trash . Not durable , Not Substantial , This bag is very expensive for its low volume use . Consider another manufacturer for your bag as this one will never stand up to even simple light weight use .	-1
I was swayed by all the good reviews and bought one , even though the older style Canon backpack I had bought and then promptly got rid of some years back had left a bad taste in my mouth . Well , let 's just say things are n't much better . There are a number of improvements and the styling is nice . But a Rebel with battery grip does n't fit . Therefore , I do n't think a 10D or a 20D will either . Not sure about an XT since it is smaller . Assuming of course you have the add on battery grip like I do . The zippers absolutely stink . They are light duty and do n't zip smoothly . I feel like the weight of the camera up high will force the zippers to slowly unzip and there goes the camera . I am so unimpressed . It 's not even worth the cheap price Amazon is asking in my opinion . Spend some more money for a good bag like a Tamrac .	-1
As many users suggested here , this backpack is OK to use , but when you stuff pro gears like a Nikon D300 camera , a 17-55mm F2.8 and a 70-200mm F2.8 lens , and a SB800 flash , the bag is not strong enough to hold them tight - the major problem is the pads separating the rooms in the bag are a bit on the thin side , you just do n't feel this product is sturdy and safe . But what can I say , cheapo is cheapo .	-1
Dont know why it has so many 4.5 stars . I found this bag unappealing and uncomfortable . May be good for my 4 yr old son but not for my height ( I am 6 ft tall ) . Capacity is ok. Functionality is terrible . I tried to slide my tripod into the side straps but does n't fit . ABSOLUTELY will not look classy as a backpack . I ordered the Caselogic DSLR sling ( much more classier looking ) . Bottom line , I am returning it . Seriously , still do n't know why so many good reviews !	-1
I bought this pack because it was inexpensive and quickly found out that the `` You get what you pay for '' rule definitely applies to camera packs . With over $ 4500 worth of gear to put in it , I promptly returned this pack when I saw the horrible quality zipper on the main compartment.First off , this is a very small pack ... for a larger person like me , the pack just did n't fit right ( I almost ran out of room on the pull straps when wearing the pack ) . The zipper on the main compartment was defective and kept coming open ( from both the zipper pulls as well as from the opposite end . Yikes ! A 20D or larger body would have a difficult time fitting into this pack.Remember : `` You get what you pay for '' .	-1
Boy , this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens . It 's a great a lens , but this is hardly worth the price .	-1
I bought this for my wife , who was concerned about having a more secure strap . It is secure there is no doubt about that , but it cuts into the back of you neck a bit . During the winter it is not an issue , because you wear a coat , but during the warmer months we do not use it .	-1
It works ; does the job . It looks good . However , it looks so fragile that I ca n't keep it out of plastic bubble wrapping . I feel like it 's gon na fail me on the field one day or another -- scary . Super expensive considering it 's very cheap plastic-made and only contain a wire and a push-pull button . I wanted to build one myself but of course Canon used a special plug/socket that I could n't find on the market . If you can find a third party one , go for it !	-1
This is what I should have paid attention to : '' Sure enough , the very first time using the tripod a tiny little piece on one of the plastic snaps that keeps the legs anchored to the center pole broke , allowing the leg to flop around freely with no bracing . `` Mine arrived today , nicely packed ... and with that little piece pre-broken at the leg end , not the center pole end.Gee Mom , I 'd rather have broken it myself . Needed ( note past tense ) it for an awards banquet on 31 January . I have great faith in Canon , was gon na put my new Canon digital camera on top of it . I have gambled , and asked for a replacement , not a refund . I neither want nor expect a high end tripod at ~ $ 40 . I do expect it to arrive intact , and last a couple of years of infrequent use before it breaks.Keep watching this space ! I will report on the delivery speed , and physical integrity , of the replacement .	-1
I bought it TWICE on Amazon.com ( an UPDATE - I bought it 3rd time - now on eBay ) and have returned it twice ( I am now selling this crap ) - I was so not impressed by that lens - so much hype about it and a steep price tag , but images are blurry due to the lack of image stabilization and quality is not 4 times better compare to 4 times less expensive consumer-grade lens . I 'll wait for that lens to get IS finally . An Update - colors are not natural too - I have other L-series lenses and this one is totally bad , bad , bad - I am selling it - finally and forever .	-1
This is the 1st generation version of the lens being offered at the price of the 2nd gen version -- a $ 700 ripoff . Trying to snare the naive -- shame on amazon.con	-1
So I know this is a red ring lens . I own 5 of them and only 1 of them do I actually feel was worth the price.With the software being what it is today paying twice as much for that last f-stop level is n't worth it.This is a decently built lens but you are paying for the wide aperture and the moderate zoom range.Its not very sharp at 2.8 so you will stop down to 3.5if you are shooting in low light and go with f/2.8 you are trading a softer image for less noise . IMO that is a bad trade . Spend a little money on a good noise reduction program and buy the 24-105 lens its sharp at f/4 and it has a lot more zoom range.Or get a 50mm prime if range is n't that important to you . But these lenses are actually terrible when you think about our options on software as photographers .	-1
This stuff is just plain noxious . You ca n't use it in the house . I used it outside on the porch , spraying a tiny bit on a PEC Pad and wiping the slide . Some of the older ( ca . 1963 Kodachrome ) slides were damaged by the fluid . It worked well on newer slides . The best results were obtained when slides were so dirty that they were basically unusable any other way . Some had mildew on them and this cleaned them up pretty well . It also removes gummy deposits well . In most cases , just blowing dust off the tray-mounted slides using canned air , them blowing off the scanner platten glass and immediately scanning , was the best way to get clean scans . Also , light brushing with a lens brush can be helpful , as well as light rubbing with a PEC Pad . Using this photographic emulsion spray is definitely a last resort . After scanning several thousand slides , I still have most of the bottle left .	-1
I used this pad briefly on my Tamrac 606 bag loaded with an EOS 5D , 2 lenses and Speedlite . This is a rigid , heavy and hard pad : does not warp around or mold to my shoulder but , instead , sits on top and bites into my flesh like an angry dog . It 's also really heavy and makes the strap cumbersome . The original Tamrac strap pad is more comfy : softer and flexible enough to warp around my shoulder and chest and , thus , distribute weight across a larger area . All I can say is the USPS of yesteryear had shoulders of steel . Incidentally I checked out my postman 's shoulder pad and it does n't look anything like this one : real leather , longer , wider , more flexible and no velcro .	-1
For what I paid ( $ 18.55 current price ) I should have gotten way more . Like at least two of these , maybe three . I looked at the size chart on Lowepro 's site and it suggested this for my Nikon 18-200 . Unfortunately , the case is way too big for it . I was hoping it would be somewhat of a secure fit , but no - my big expensive lens bounces around inside this thing - even with the hood on it . Consequently , this case is HUGE . Annoyingly so.The materials used on this case feel very cheap . Extremely cheap , actually . The zipper is n't smooth at all.It does have a belt clip . I 'd have to be in a pretty miserable situation to go out in public with this thing strapped to my hip , but hey , it 's there if you have to have it .	-1
I bought this battery as an auxiliary to carry in my Lowepro bag for when the main battery on my Canon ZR-500 runs down . Sometimes the switch will go from the `` off '' position to `` camera '' which leads to my battery being drained . I bought the Lenmar DLC2L to combat this problem.Well after attaching the Lenmar to my Canon videocamera the battery looked to be the perfect fit until after its attachment and several uses I noticed that the energy of the battery seemed less and less from where it would have been had I been using a Canon model . Indeed , the battery was virtually drained after less than 10-15 minutes ' use of the camera . To me this was/is unacceptable.Stay away from this product . At best , it is only a below average secondary battery , at worst is is a wattage-wasting energy loser.A . Nathaniel Wallace , Jr .	-1
I ordered the 48-58mm wrench set , and Adorama ( via Amazon ) sent me the 46-55mm wrench set . These are too small for my 58mm filter attachments . Given the low cost , it 's not even worth the hassle and time for doing a return/exchange . Instead , I 'll just order the proper sized wrenches from B & H directly , and I 'll give these smaller ones to whomever could use them .	-1
I gave this a shot after reading mixed reviews . I thought I could live with it but after trying to use it , I ended up selling it .	-1
It 's unfortunate that the Nikon D600 even requires this cap to prevent light leakage in through the viewfinder , but I 'm afraid the design is such that if you use it as design , you 'll lose it.To keep the cap with the camera you 'll undoubtedly expect that you can attach it to your camera strap and it will stay put . Not so ! I bought TWO of these and the first one fell off the strap on the first DAY ! I do most of my shooting at night so that cap is LOST . To make it really useful instead of having a `` clip '' to keep the cap on your camera strap , they have put an opening large enough to thread the camera strap through so that the cap CA N'T fall off.As designed it 's a whole lot easier to lose than a lens cap . The only way I 've been able to keep from losing my second one is by keeping it ON the camera ... but of course that means I have no eyepiece to look through and it also means I am NOT carrying around the padded eyepiece.FYI . I also have three other camera bodies , all Canon and while each of them will meter incorrectly if there is no eyepiece cap , only my Nikon D600 REQUIREs this cap to prevent severe light leakage . That is , while my Canon cameras also have eyepiece caps ( which are designed to have the camera strap threaded through them ) , it turns out I do n't NEED them on the Canon 's . Too bad Nikon did n't steal Canon 's cap design , or Nikon did n't steal Canon 's leak-proof viewfinder .	-1
This mediacase is a big disappointment . I have felt like throwing it away . It does allow for much storage , but this is no way of knowing what photograph or series of photographs is on each disk . There is no room to type out what is on each disk because there is no way to know which 4GB disk is which . I have another case which numbers each disk so that six discs can be numbered in each case . I can put a list of the photographs on disk 1 and disk 2 , etc.I would not buy another another case like this , nor would I store any information on disk that I have . If you are OK with a lot of storage slots that are not numbered so that you can identify it , then this is a cheap way to carry a lot of disks .	-1
I have three Hakuba cases , and as Amazon conveniently pointed out , I 've ordered this very before . Unfortunately , what I received this time around is not what was pictured . Instead it is black ( definitely NOT the color I would have wanted ( too difficult to see in my gear ) , does not have a retaining strap of any sort ( though , for me , this is unecessary ) , and finally it certainly does n't seem like it 's as `` substantial '' as my other Hakuba cases.If this is what is available , then so be it . However , please understand that when shopping online , pictures are all we have to decide what product to purchase . Given a choice between what I received and what was pictured , I would have never chosen what I received .	-1
I went through two copies of this filter and finally gave up and requested a refund . The snap ring that holds the glass in place was out both times and on one of the filters , the glass was n't even edge-to-edge ! ! Terrible QA standards . I went to B+W filters and will never consider Hoya as an option again .	-1
In the last three weeks , in my workshops , I have witnessed 4 , that 's 4 Hoya polarizer filters fall apart in my or my student 's hands , one purchased the day before at the Ansel Adams Gallery in Yosemite National Park . What 's even more disturbing is this is an old problem . Google `` hoya polarizer filters '' and you 'll find narratives about this dating back 6 years . And they do scratch easily ... No more Hoya for me . No wonder you see so many Hoya filters at deep discounts lately ; the word is getting around . Buy anything but Hoya ...	-1
If you read the negative & # 34 ; technical & # 34 ; reviews on this voltage regulator , most of them are fair and honest , yet disappointing . I put mine up against a meter where the voltages were low and high.I called the customer help number for APC and ended up talking for a loooooooong time to a person that repeated everything I said to him , back to me , and most times getting it incorrect ... and not my fault.He was patient and earnest but alas yet another company hiring & # 34 ; triage & # 34 ; help desk clerks with very little knowledge armed with only a pre-written script.He eventually had to place me on hold several times so he could ask a higher level tech for answers.Here is what he explained to me : The unit actually is a small boost or cut in voltage . It will not , nor does it act as what most people would think of as a & # 34 ; regulator. & # 34 ; This unit will either boost or cut the voltage by a factor of 6 % .If you are in America and have it set to 120 but have a low voltage service coming to your home , say 90 volts for example . This unit will only boost it 6 % or approximately 5.4 volts If you are at 95 volts , then you may get close to 100 volts using this & # 34 ; booster & # 34 ; . 10 volts will go to 106 volts ... and so on.Likewise if you are experiencing high voltage service at your home , this unit will reduce it by a factor of 6 % .130 volts will be reduced to 122 volts . Still running a little hot , whereas in the USA most voltages are 110-120.This may help minor power surges or low voltages , and may keep your computer or TV from & # 34 ; messing up & # 34 ; , but it only does 6 % either way.If you are unsure of how & # 34 ; hot or cold & # 34 ; your devices can safely operate , consult the manufacturer or owners manual . ( or a friend who knows about this type of stuff . ) I play loud guitar at a place that has & # 34 ; dirty & # 34 ; electricity . This devices will not help with & # 34 ; dirty electricity. & # 34 ; If there are other machines , coolers , air conditioners , heaters , washing machines , dryers that use a lot of power and may have a bad ground or poor circuitry , this APC unit will not & # 34 ; condition & # 34 ; the line , though there have been honest reports of some devices that & # 34 ; no longer hum & # 34 ; or do n't shut off & restart when the air conditioner kicks on , etc.A really good quality Voltage Regulator/Power Conditioner will cost well over four bills . ( Benjamins . ) There is no way of getting around it , yet I decided to keep this unit as I can not afford the expensive ones in hopes that any help will be better than nothing . Try it ... if you hate it ... send it back !	-1
Ok , I 'm wondering if I 'm alone here . With all these great reviews , one would think that these headphones are great , at a deal price . Unfortunately , they look , feel , and sound cheap . I tried them on different music players and the sound never lost that boxy feeling . It sounds like it 's stuck right in the middle of the EQ , flat and lifeless . Now , do n't try to tell me that a pair of headphones should be flat and without coloring the sound . I 'd agree . But , that 's not the case here . The only time it showed some sort of life was when I played some Beastie Boys . Any other music genre sounded as if the sound was coming out of cardboard boxes.These headphones are not even worth half the Black Friday price . The only thing useful is the adapter that came with it.Do n't get fooled by the cool DJ look . They 're not worth it , at any price .	-1
PROS : - Cheap , so you can toss em around and not worry about breaking them- In-line volume controlCONS : - Audio is HORRIBLE . I 'm a musician , so my hearing might be more picky than normal , but damn , the frequencies out of these phones are atrocious . Muddy , muddy , muddy . Way too much bass , really muffled mids , and no highs , no clarity . It really takes the enjoyment out of listening to music.- The headband is unprotected plastic , so your hair WILL snag and get caught in the band . When you remove the headphones , you 'll also remove some of your hair , which hurts.- Ear cup sizes are small ; the cups compress your ears , rather than encapsulate them.This product is n't totally unusable ; I 'll definitely bring them along for air travel , because they 're cheap enough to toss around and the inline volume control is great . But I wish I had n't bought them in the first place.UPDATE : They broke . Specifically , one of the ear cups just fell out of the headband . Evidently , the plastic tabs used to hold the cups into the headband are EXTREMELY flimsy . Seriously , this is some extraordinarily cheap and shoddy build-quality .	-1
Not only do you get no case , no cradle , and no user 's guide , but you get a battery that lasts 2 hours at medium brightness with secure digit card inserted , a super slippery stylus , and you 'll be happy to spend hours and hours setting up the sync software , plus you 'll be sticking the stylus into the `` reset '' hole many , many times each joyful day . You 'll love to bang your head against the wall numerous times when you want to sync it with more than one PC.I admit the styling is great , but this is a [ poor ] PDA , because it requires you to constantly soft reset . And it slows to a crawl when you run more than three apps at the same time . Fuhget it .	-1
I did n't want this iPaq 1945 due to previous negative experiences with iPaq 's ( including the very first one that developed the infamous dust-under-screen problem within a week and and became unusable after a month ) , but my manager who used to work HP likes HP so he forced us to buy this model . Not a single person in my 10-person group likes it , because of sluggish performance , frequent need to soft-reset , and tons of problems syncing with Outlook 2000 and XP under Windows XP and 2000.Anyway , what 's really ticking me off right now is a mysterious , random hard-reset problem . It started around Thanksgiving , when one day I was on the subway and needed to check the address of my client , so I whipped out the 1945 and to my great horror , it performed a hard reset on its own , giving me the middle-finger salute with the ugly HP welcome screen that you only see after a hard reset . I had just recharged the battery , and the unit was n't even 3 months old , so I was totally horrified.That was just the beginning of my problems . Ever since then the unit would turn itself off without warning , and occasionally ( to be fair , not all the time ) it would just hard-reset on its own . I do n't think this kind of behavior is acceptable at all in a PDA . You buy a PDA to store information and retrieve it whenever you need it , not to stare at a blank screen at your most critical moment.Other people in my group also have various problems with the 1945 , from broke backlight on one unit to frequent syncing problems on another to inaccurate digitizer on yet another . BTW I 've always had syncing problems with IPAQs in the past , and still do these days : when I hook up my iPaq to my Win XP machine , it would take almost 5 minutes for the sync to start . Every day , using the iPaq 1945 is a very frustrating experience , and sluggish performance ( even in Calendar and Contacts ) is only the least of it.Stay away from these poor products . It 's your money and you deserve better . For Pocket PC 's , Toshiba seems to be putting its act together and has come out with some very good models , including the VGA-resolution ( 640x480 ) e800/e805 .	-1

This must be the most frustrating device it has ever been my misfortune to own ! With some regularity , and with no apparent reason , it resets itself to factory settings . I spend more time restoring and reinstalling than I actually spend productively.At least 5-6 times per day , I have to do a soft reset because the thing locks up . Half the time it wo n't connect or sync either via USB or wireless.I 've had the iPAQ for a year now , and am just getting ready to do a complete reinstall . Once again , it reset itself . Two weeks ago , same thing . This is the last time , however , there is a hammer in the iPAQ 's future . I mean it.Afterthought : who ever heard of a device that ca n't be turned off ? What numbskull designed a computer that loses everything if it loses power ? Duh .	-1

I bought this antenna thinking I can use it to view the NFL football games on Sunday 's while in my office complex during the weekends . As long as you are near a window , the reception is great . This antenna works fine , picking-up 16 local channels including some HD one 's . Unfortunately , my desk is not near a window and I can not pick up a single channel.Overall , the device is OK for the money . It was relatively inexpensive . But it does not do the job I intended it to do , therefore , the so-so review . I think the manufacturer should state the fact that these devices do not work well inside office buildings . That way there is no confusion by the consumer when it come time for purchasing . My next attempt would be to buy a amplified one , but I 'm not sure they would work well enough , either .	-1

This unit was easy to install and set up . I bought it to transmit a security camera signal from a downstairs dvr to an upstairs television . After some adjustment and positioning of the antennas from each unit I got a picture BUT not without continuous blips in the signal . I read online that cordless phones using 2.4 ghz cause interference in this product , and we have those . I tried disabling the phones ( by unplugging the base and removing the batteries ) but this did NOT improve the signal . I also disabled and turned off fans controlled by wireless remotes , and unplugged modules that allow one to turn on a lamp by touching it . None of those measures worked , and the signal remained unchanged . I expected better performance than this unit delivers .	-1

I 've had my MiniPro Plus/B for a little over a year now and one of the locking rings for the legs became stripped so it would no longer keep the leg extended ( they 're made of plastic with fine thread so it 's easier to strip them ) . My low rating is n't so much for the fact that the locking ring/nut stripped so easily , but rather due to SunPak 's absolutely horrible customer service department . I emailed them TWICE about this since it `` supposedly '' has a lifetime warranty , only requesting a replacement locking plastic retainer ring/nut for it . I 've yet to hear from them and it 's been over a month and a half since the first email . I do n't know if I should purchase another one and thus have 2 spare locking rings should the replacement fail in time ( which I 'm sure it will ) or just try to find another brand that 's better made ; or at least has a better manufacturer 's customer service.Any warranty ( lifetime or not ) is only as good as the company behind it , and thus far , Sunpak seems to be one to avoid .	-1

Sorry but I hate this . They come on Stroboframe brackets , such as the real nice Stroboframe 350 brackets . I immediately get rid of them and replace them with something else . I like to just screw in whatever I am attaching on my bracket directly with a 1/4-20 screw . I use a Promaster TTL cord with it 's own base and with it 's own shoe on top of that base . I screw it directly into the bracket with a screw from the hardware store . I ruined a Promaster base , cracking the shoe off with one of these Stroboframe devices the first day I used it on a wedding job getting just getting out of the car . Manfrotto makes a replacement cold flash shoe that you can screw into whatever you are going to use this Stroboframe shoe for . The Manfrotto version does not have the side screw that overtightens to the device you are inserting into the shoe . Your device just slides in . Most speedlights have their own built in tightening device anyway .	-1
I plugged this thing in and instantly could tell it was terrible . One it fit loosely it was n't tight , but it was not ridiculously loose just loose enough I did n't feel much resistance at all when plugging it in . Second the sound quality was worse than anything I 've ever heard , I could not even tell what song was playing it was so bad . I would not recommend this product .	-1

This has a guide number ( GN ) of about 10-20 ft at ISO 100 , i.e . very weak . This GN was computed from the dial on the unit . The specs do n't spell out the GN . I have n't checked whether it actually delivers that power . Even a GN of 20 is very weak ( e.g . 5 ft at f/4 , ISO 100 ) .This flash uses 2 AAA batteries . Why not the longer-lasting AA ? Why not 4 batteries ? This flash will not work with cameras that have a pre-flash.I returned mine right away .	-1

I bought this to use with my HP ZD 7000 laptop . Things went wrong right from the beginning . The driver/application/installation process hung repeatedly . I finally had to go directly to Creative 's web site to get the most current drivers . Although I eventually got the camera to work , picture quality was poor , and the frame rate was a joke . The slightest movement produced smearing and broken images . The frame rate was closer to one frame per second than the advertised 15 frames per second . Undaunted , I tried it on another computer ( an 1800MHz AMD Athlon ) . The results were the same . I returned at the next day.When Amazon credits my account , I 'm going to buy a Logitech 4000 . This camera appears to meet my need for quality . I thought I was getting a bargain by buying the PD 1130 for $ 38 . Do n't be fooled . You will end up returning this camera . Spend a little more and get something that works .	-1

You do not want to get any Nikon cameras from the last 4~5 years . Most of them use the SONY CCD sensor , which has been failing like crazy as of late . Of course , for the 5400 , Nikon finally fessed up and decided to issue a service advisory . But the company 's repair record is so spotty that I 've decided never to buy a Nikon again . They tried to `` fix '' my sensor the 1st , and ended up breaking the control system . My camera is now in for its 3rd `` redo . `` Do n't buy this camera unless you like non-functioning cameras and nonexistent service .	-1
I use this co-ax to connect a brand new standard flat screen TV to cable service . The signal was poor and because the cable and TV were new , I though it was the signal . The cable service technician solved the problem by replacing the cable.So I am down the price of the cable , shipping and a $ 50 technician 's fee.Do n't buy this cable .	-1
This is a good antenna for urban areas and those not too far from the broadcast towers . For those that live in more rural areas farther away from the towers , this will not work very good at all for you . I live about 40 miles from all channels broadcast towers . I can pick up maybe 1 or 2 prime channels . When I moved to the Philadelphia suburbs , it works fine .	-1
When I decided to cancel my cable subscription and switch to OTA programming , I needed to find a good , cheap antenna for my HDTV . Based on the reviews and my research on Amazon , this antenna seemed like a safe and cheap option . However , when I received and installed the antenna , I was quite underwhelmed by the performance of the antenna . I live in an area of good coverage ( based on the information available at antennaweb.org ) with stations within 10-12 miles of my residence . I also placed the antenna next to a window in my living room . Yet , I was only able to lock in on 3 channels with this antenna ! No amount of fiddling with the antenna and the knob on it helped improve my reception . Even the 3 channels that I was receiving would occasionally glitch and freeze due to drops in the signal reception . This was clearly unacceptable , so I did some more research and decided to pay more , bite the bullet , and order thePaper Thin Leaf Indoor HDTV Antenna - Made in the USA ! . I received it today , and boy am I floored by its performance ! The Mohu leaf was able to find 24 channels as compared to the 3 that my RCA antenna found ! Additionally , the signal strength for one of the channels was in the mid to high 90s with the Mohu Leaf antenna , while it was in the low 50s with this RCA antenna . I was very skeptical of the Mohu Leaf as it looked a bit gimmicky , but it sure does the job ! I would very strongly recommend spending a little extra and getting the Mohu Leaf . It is most definitely a better antenna and you will definitely pick up more stations than with this antenna.I 'm sure this antenna is decent if you have amazing reception , but given my experience with the RCA and the Mohu Leaf , I would just recommend that new buyers looking for an antenna pay a little more and get the Mohu Leaf . The Mohu product is one of a rare breed of products that are actually worth the extra price .	-1
The quality is cheap but so is the price so you expect that . The antenna only picks up 2 channels for me so I 'm glad I got the Winegard Freevision FV-30BB HDTV Antenna at the same time . This one is sitting in the box it came in and the Winegard is outside and wired to the whole house .	-1
It was cheap , and lasted maybe a week before I started getting static from bad connectors . To cheap to send back . Just have to buy a better quality one .	-1
The absolute lowest grade coil cord I have ever seen . Makes dollar store junk look like AT & T in the 1960 's	-1
I bought this for my girlfriend so she could drop it in her purse and pull it out to take long exposure shots . The product smells terrible and makes anything it rubs up against smell bad . It ca n't be put in a purse , even when wrapped in a paper towel or something . We ended up replacing it with a gorillapod and have n't looked back .	-1
I guess you get what you pay for rings true here . I bought this to hold up a small camera . Well , that plan did n't work out too well . I could n't get it to stand up without falling over . Total waste of money . I ended up going to best buy to their camera department and bought a more solid mini tripod that worked perfectly . Buyer beware . Make sure your camera is really really light or it will fall over .	-1
Normally I 'm not one for poor reviews ... even after reading a lot of decent reviews on this to decide to buy it . It screws into the camera just fine , but the legs are just too stiff and rigid . Maybe I have n't `` broken it in '' enough , but even then the length of the legs and the stiffness do n't seem like they will ever bode well to be an actually usable tripod . I 've had better results with a webcam stand that has a multi adjustable ball-type joint thing.Its about as good of a tripod as two dollar bills would be , so just keep your money .	-1
Do n't waste your time - get one a little less cheap . There is a reason that S & H ; is more than product price.This is the same exact product as `` Vanguard VS41 Flexible MiniTripod '' They do n't support my tiny Lumix FX33 and are more elastic than `` poseable '' .	-1
You can not crank the thing down hard enough on the ball joint to hold the camera mounting platform in place.I regret I wound up with a nice looking piece of junk . The mount has a little ball joint with a tab you are supposed to tighten down to prevent ball rotation once the little mounting platform is in the position you want it . However , the mechanism does not work . You can tighten that tab down until your fingers hurt , but with a modest little shirt pocket digital camera mounted on it , that 's all the weight it needs and the ball slips loose and your camera flops down , making it impossible to position.It 's a shame . This would be a wonderful and handy little product if it worked , but it does not . Do n't buy it .	-1
This is a complete waste of time . I regret buying this item . You can barely hear anything when u even bring it close to your ear . Dont waste your money !	-1
Should n't even be called `` speakers . '' I attached these to my netbook whose speakers are not great but are better than these little things . These made the sound muffled and I am better off using the netbook speakers instead . Do not bother .	-1
Connected to my computer , XP sees the device but ( despite what the manual says ) it would not give access to it ; keeps asking for the driver . Smartdisk site says no driver required , when you try to get tech support , you have to register , but the site does not recognize your user-id if you do register.Recommendation : Stick to western digital , maxtor or other recognized brand .	-1
Seems some motherboards simply wo n't accept keyboard ps/2 to usb adapters . My MB is one of them , so I ca n't use my IBM M keyboard with the trackpoint , I have to use a separate mouse if I want to use my beloved keyboard .	-1
Not being an expert with telescopes , i ordered this because of what i found online . Tried mounting my DSLR to my telescope and can not get a focus ! My focusing lenses with the telescope will not fit between the Adapter and the Camera Body ! Nor can I find one that will ! Do more homework than i did is all i can suggest ! If you have a very high end telescope this may work !	-1
1 star is too generous . Can I give it a -5 ? I have a sad story to share with my fellow Amazon.com shoppers : I have a Linksys Wireless-G Cable Gateway ( WCG200 ) attached to aLinksys High Gain Antenna Kit for TNC Connectors HGA7T , a Linksys wireless-G USB Network Adapter ( WUSB54G ) & /or a wireless-G adapter with Speedbooster ( WUSB54GS ) . One of my computer is setup with a cat-5e cable . The other I play around to see if I can get it wireless.Everything worked fine for a while but when I upgraded my wireless computer from a P3 800 Mhz to a P4 3.2 Mhz Prescott cpu ( + a new Asus P4P800-E motherboard ) , all hell broke loose . Sometimes I would have internet connection . Most of the time I would have my computer crashing & crashing . I downloaded the driver ( s ) of both the WUSB54G & WUSB54GS drivers from my other computer from Linksys.com & tried them all . My computer stoppedcrashing but still no internet connection through my Linksys wireless cable modem.I emailed Linksys to ask for a possible solution . They email me back stating that if my old P3 worked , then my new P4 should work as well . The wireless computer is only 60 feet away from the cable modem ( both on the same floor ) & the reception signal is 54 % . How come I have no connection ? The moral of this story is that you either need to be an computer expert or you have alot of time to kill if you want to set it up wireless.This is the kind of crap that gets a guy start drinking heavily . Wasted 9 days trying to set up wireless . Now both computers are connected through the cat-5e cables .	-1
Do n't drop it more than two feet or the thing will bust . Cheapest plastic ever . It managed to do the job , but I would n't recommend .	-1
Bottom Line : The Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' is a good compromise if one needs a USB connected wireless network adapter that conforms to the Wireless-G standard . If you can , go with a PCI adapter for much better performance.When I recently rebuilt my primary workstation I found to my chagrin that my existing Linksys Wireless-G WMP54G PCI NIC would not work in my new AOpen A4C Max motherboard . Try as I might ( a few BIOS upgrades and disabling the card ) I could not get it to work , due to the integration of the Broadcom Gigabit PCI LAN Chip into the board . Enter the `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G . `` The Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz , and supports the following wireless protocols : 802.11b and 802.11g . The Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G can transmit and receive networking traffic in a range of 1 - 54Mbps . I choose the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' for three reasons ; 1 . The card operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz the same frequency band I currently use for my wireless communications ; 2 . The Linksys name is one I have come to trust for reliability and cutting edge technology ; 3 . The Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' is USB version . 2.0 compliant.Installation : The installation of the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' is a very straight forward process : just plug it in -- with the computer on -- and it starts working ! My Microsoft Windows XP Professional Operating System ( OS ) found it and installed the necessary drivers , and made it ready for use . There is no software to install ; thought Linksys does provide a utility to configure the card to work with your wireless setup , which I admit a non Windows XP user might need . However , Windows XP Professional is designed -- once a wireless device is installed -- to seek out available wireless networks and configure the card accordingly ; i.e . assign it an IP address , if DHCP ( Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ) is used on the network . I use DHCP on my combined wired and wireless network , but I assigned the Linksys `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' an IP address because my computer serves as my Internet gateway.If you do decide to install the software , good luck . Like a lot of Linksys software utilities of late -- even those downloaded directly from the Linksys website -- the software refuses to load ; e.g . the autostart start , and then stops abruptly . So I opened Windows Explorer , browsed to the CD and double-clicked on the setup.exe under the Utility directory ; no dice . Only a token portion of the software loaded , enough of a token to keep render the card useless . So I uninstalled the software and left it uninstall ; as I pointed out above if you are using the Windows XP OS there will be no need for the software that ships with the card . Will it install under Windows 98/Me/Se/2000 ? , Perhaps , but no longer owing a computer with any of those OS 's installed , I can not credibility speak to it.First ImpressionsI have mixed feelings about the `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' Linksys surprisingly dropped the ball in the design of this card . While the `` Wireless-G WUSB54G '' occasionally transmits and receives at 54Mbps , the speed of the card fluctuates on a continual basis reaching as low as 1MBps , several times a minute ! I have placed the card is various locations around my loft not more than 75 feet from the Wireless Access Point ( WAP ) , but still the fluctuating carrier speed continues to my frustration . And while the antenna is small , it is larger than the one on the Linksys `` Wireless-G WPC54G CardBus Adapter '' installed in my notebook , which manages to maintains a consistent carrier speed of 54Mbps.This annoying pervasive fluctuating carrier speed has affected at times the speed at which I access the Internet and move file to and from my workstation and the rest of the network . Linksys offers no advice on how to fix this problem other then the usual `` move the adapter around and adjust the antenna '' pronouncements , which do little to fix the problem . My advice : do n't but this card unless your computer will not support a PCI NIC.ConclusionThe `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G '' receives a C+ from me . While I give the card high marks for ease of installation and configuration -- thanks in part to Windows XP Professional -- but I give it low marks for overall performance . If you are looking to make the leap to the Wireless-G protocol , and leave far behind the vestiges of the now obsolete ( in my mind anyway ) 11Mps standard , shy away from the `` Linksys Wireless-G WUSB54G '' unless no other option is open to you .	-1
An important feature of this adapter is the locking lever 's ability to rotate 360 degrees . Often , the camera or tripod pedestal , or something else prevents full 360 degree rotation , therefore , the lever is spring loaded so you can pull it out , to allow free rotation without moving the screw . This allows you to tighten and loosen the grip even when you have limited clearance . Well , this often does not work , because the lever requires you to pull it out way too much to clear the hex head , it barely clears at all , so when you rotate the handle it is still engaging the screw . In my application there is not enough room to grab the tightening lever and pull it out to the very limit of it 's maximum movement ( also it takes a lot of effort because of the increasing spring tension ) . The brass hex screw head ( only visible when you pull the lever out ) which must be engaged to tighten or loosen the clamping is way too long ! I compared the length of the brass hex head to the one supplied on the Manfrotto MVH502AH Pro Video head . That one works just right because the screw head is about a fourth or a third the length , so with a much shorter pull there clearance to rotate the knob without engaging the tightening screw . Either this 577 was designed poorly , or the manufacturer failed to use wrong brass hex head screw.I swapped out the tightening knob/screw unit from the MVH502AH and with the one that came with the Manfrotto 3433PL 577 and then it works the way it should.I 'm thinking of returning this for a replacement but I 'm worried that the replacement might be just as bad . I might instead disassemble it and shorten the brass hex head . I should not have to `` repair it '' . Obviously , there is not sufficient Quality Control by Manfrotto . Someone should have noticed that this does not work too well in practice.The reason that this item gets very good reviews must be either that few of the reviewers have clearance problems ( with the bottom of their camera or a mounting plate beneath the camera , OR that their sample came with the proper `` short hex head '' tightening screw .	-1
I purchased this stand and it arrived slightly bent . It is usable , but is a very flimsy product . My advice is to spend a little more money and get a better product .	-1
Do n't bother buying one of these from Amazon - they are selling USED as NEW ! The one I ordered came with a scratched screen and connector.Thanks Amazon - another order going to NewEgg .	-1
The Chromatic Aberration ( purple fringing on bright objects ) with this lens is just awful . Stop your lens down to f2 and take a photo of a brightly lit chrome faucet . Look closer . See it ? Try stopping down to f5.6 or even f11 . Sure it gets a little better , but it 's still there.This lens is frustrating ! I 'm selling mine !	-1
Nice , sharp , bright , fast . But the darned thing focuses slightly in front of the subject.I was using the AF to get close and then switching to manual focus to fine tune , but then I decided , hey , why am I doing this for $ 360 ? Its not my imagination . I ran a test with a tripod and three focus cards on sticks . Very disappointed.I assume you can adjust it , but that should be the manufacturer 's job.Thanks be to Amazon , they accepted a return at less than 30 days and gave me a refund.Canon should hire Amazon 's Customer Service Manager . You have to like Amazon . Canon Customer Tech Support actually told me that I had to be wrong . Blame the victim.Amazon is , I think , the best customer service and support organization out there.BTW , I now have my second Tamron lens . Top quality performance and a six ( 6 ) year warranty . With Piezo drive their technology is ahead of the prime manufacturers .	-1
Disclaimer : This rating is for the lens I got from Amazon and not the lens in general.At first I thought there was some learning curve to using this lens that I was n't privy to then I remembered that I 'd used the 50mm 1.8 and never had to question whether I 'd needed learn to focus properly at wide apertures ( I 've been shooting for over 7 years ) . Forget about accuracy at 1.4 , but even at 1.8 and many times at 2.0 , I could n't match the cheaper 50mm 1.8 in terms of ratio of shots in focus ( and I had to manually set focus points each time ) . That 's too much work.Also , this lens does not do out-of-focus well . The image quality for distant objects that are not in perfect focus is just off . Not in a creamy bokeh kind of 'off ' but a poor resolution grainy kind.There 's no point in owning the lens if I ca n't trust it to nail focus and there 's no point in buying a more expensive lens if it wo n't focus as accurately as a cheaper one.Lens returned .	-1
There are a number of reviewers who complain about focus issues with this lens . In my enthusiasm to get what many have said is a great lens , i omitted to read the bad reviews . It turns out to have been a mistake . Most of the complaints are about the focus failing after a few months . Others are about the lenses failure to focus properly at all , both in autofocus and manual focus . That 's the problem with the lens that I received . On receiving the lens , at first it hunted before settling on the focus , but that soon disappeared.After taking a number of pictures and finding that none of the photographs were really sharp , it was evident to conduct a test eliminating all other possibilities.After setting up the camera on a sturdy tripod , using a 7D , and taking a series of photographs of static objects , using a remote trigger the proof was clear - there is a problem with the lens . On my return to the US this lens is going back to Canon.Now it is a matter of habit to look at the 1 star ranked comments . It seems that recently Canon 's lenses are getting more than their share . It also appears that they are too quick to blame the consumer.Perhaps they can take a leaf from Olympus 's book . It seems that when a company gets into financial difficulties their attitude towards customers improves . One hopes that does not become necessary for Canon.Update -- -- -- There is a solution to the poor focus , at least for owners of the 7D ( and possibly other bodies ) . There is a feature called AF micro-adjustment , found in the menus under Custom Function menu at C.FnIII-05 . Select option 2 - Adjust by lens . Press the INFO button , and this allows one to compensate fot the poor calibration of the lens.To assess the level of adjustment , attach a piece of lined piece of paper to a flat wall . Set the camera on a tri-pod perpendicular to the wall . Focus the camera manually ( preferably with magnified live view ) and then test using to autofocus . Adjust using the micro-adjustment until manual and auto-focus are the same.Then lens being reviewed balanced out at +17 , nearly the limit of the adjustment.The lens , once focussed produces great pictures . It 's not the responsibility of customers to do quality control . That this is not an isolated instance does not reflect well on Canon.Update 2 -- -- -- -- Sent the lens to the Canon Factory Service Center . The service was prompt and efficient , and the lens was back in under a week . The lens is much better , but not at the level it should be . The auto-focus quality is worse than manual focus . It 's also worse than auto-focus withCanon EF 50mm f/1.8 II Camera Lensand auto-focus onCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L IS II USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras . That 's not something to rave about .	-1
Do not pay attention to the Product Description , YOU NEED ADAPTER RINGS . I 'm certain that the holder is exactly as it should be , however , the product description is wrong . I spent a considerable amount of money ( since I also purchased filters ) with the intent of using them on a two week excursion and now I will not be able to . The product description states : Product DescriptionThe Foundation Kit is a slip-on filter holder that is designed to avoid vignetting . As this holder slips over the lens , no adapter ring is required.ADAPTER RINGS ARE DEFINITELY REQUIRED ! ! ! ! Even the instructions included with the holder says that adapter rings must be used . I am extremely disappointed in Amazon .	-1
The player looks nice , I grant . But now after only 6 months of occasional use I can only get 30 minutes of play out of my batteries . Well just return them under the one year warranty right . No , the warranty on batteries is only 90 days . So the player that plays 50 hours on batteries now plays for 30 minutes . By the way new batteries cost $ 20 from I-River and mine never played anything for 50 hours . I expected better from a $ 150 cd player . My recommendation : Buy something cheaper so you 're not broke when it breaks .	-1
I got one of these since it was mac compatible with 3rd party drivers ( check out macam ) . It worked on the mac , but had horrible picture quality on both mac and PC . It 's just a cheap older-generation device with very grainy and washed out low-light performance.I bought an Philips SPC900NC for the mac , much better due to the CCD ( instead of the CMOS sensor in the Creative webcam ) .I 've tried to contact Creative for a few support requests , even about using this on a normal PC . They 're very unresponsive and unhelpful , and the drivers are sometimes buggy ( need a reboot to get the cam to work when it was working fine before ) . I 'll be buying a different company 's product next time , simply due to support .	-1
Ok other then what people are saying those circular things you call scratches are not scratches . it 's excess cleaning solution which can be cleaned right off . the smaller scratches do n't matter . no machine under a certain price removes scratches . just makes them smaller . your CD needs to be cleaned thoroughly . the real problem is . yes it can hurt your fingers . The knob tends to fall into the machine during turning ( does not disconnect ) then the pads just fall right off . returning this one tommorow . Your better off with the solution and a lint free cloth to take out the scratches with . it comes out allot better . Do not buy this .	-1
This product is a big deception . I have read so many customers complaints about this product from various websites and to tell you the truth , they are telling the truth about it . This is the second one that I have gotten and it still wo n't work . I have e-mailed Tech Support , but no response . The support page for the drivers seems to be outdated . It is now 2005 , there should be new drivers downloads for this product that has so many problems . I have installed and un-installed the software more times than I should . When I reboot the computer I have to unplug the usb so it can restart windows xp . Yes , it does get hot , yes , I did use a small fan for the overheating , even lay the product on it back and put a small towel on it with a small ice pack to keep it from overheating . This is too much and I should n't even have to go to this extreme . It either a good product that will work or not . I gave it a 1 star for having Ulead Dvd Factory and Movee software which I did n't even use . You can only record about 30-45 minutes of video footage.I am returning it back this week before my 90 days return policyexpire . Just purchase it 2 weeks ago .	-1
I have wasted many hours fiddling with this card trying to get it to work on my XP PC . No matter how I configured it , it would intermittently freeze up my PC . Netgear 's tech support tried to help but to no avail . Ultimately , I found that the MSI Turbo PCI card [ ASIN : B000M5U9GI Super G 802.11BG Wireless Pci 64 Bit Xp Compliant Turbo Mode ] works 100 % reliably on my XP PC and , ironically , gets a much stronger signal from my Netgear router .	-1
I returned this item ( Amazon is great about returns ! ) because this antenna made absolutely no improvement over the loose wire OEM antenna that came with my receiver.This is not the antennas fault ; I have three walls between my receiver and the direction of the stations so I 'll probably have to go with an outside antenna .	-1
This garbage is installed easily . And that was all that is fine about it.In my area I have many strong AM and FM stations . Then even the strongestare full of static and very weak . It is made cheaply ; from Kina of course ; Place 2 wires and you are better off that to install this crap ; Please , do n't waste your money .	-1
A wasted effort . It did absolutely nothing to improve reception over the lame loop AM and Tee FM antennas that came with my Pioneer receiver . Many years ago I had a Winegard mast-mounted FM antenna feeding a Sherwood S-9910 Receiver that blew folks away . I 'd now be pleased if I could pull in one local station without having to install a dedicated antenna in my attic . It looks as though I 'll have to resort to obtaining a bluetooth receiver adapter so I can utilize a streaming mobile android app .	-1
This is only good for short distances . Tried to use it to whale watch in Alaska while on a cruise . Should have bought an expensive one . Well , you get what you pay for !	-1
Except for the very small buttons on the remote I really liked this small , feature-laden unit until the picture started `` jittering '' after about 15 disks and a few days prior to the skimpy 90 day warranty expiring . I thought the replacement one good until it started `` jittering '' after maybe the 25th disk and about 2 months after the warranty expired . Piece of junk- do n't waste your money .	-1
Dont buy this DVD player . It freezes up often . It takes 3 hours to watch a 1:30 movie ! ! ! I bought one last year . I used it for 2 months . All this time I was wondering whether I had bad DVDs . Later I realised the DVD Player is faulty . The player is still sleeping in my closet . Waste of money.Nicholas .	-1
My Cyberhome DVD player locked up and will not play any more . I had used it maybe 10 times ! I went online and found others expressing that they had the same experience.I wish I had gone with another brand.I emailed Cyberhome with my complaint hoping they could give me some kind of advice on how to get it working again but , they never returned my email with any comment.I would not recommend any product sold by Cyberhome . It does n't seem to me as though they care about repeat business with their customers . Just sell it cheap and rip them off one at a time.Thanks , Mark	-1
After 6 months of use , this unit would freeze while playing a DVD and I would have to turn power off and then back on to play a DVD . This would work for a while and then it would freeze again . After a year the unit quit working completely . I could not find any information to contact the company about the problem.I would not suggest buying a Cyberhome unless you want a disposable DVD player you are going to replace every year .	-1
stopped focusing a couple hours after I used it . quick customer service and I returned it and bought a sigma . bad egg I guess , but that seems to happen a lot with tamron , or so i have read .	-1
I bought this lens as a lightweight alternative to my nikkors , to use basically as a walkaround lens . The lens , being mostly plastic construction , is very light , compared to other f/2.8 lenses of the same range . The optics are fine and it is fairly sharp wide open at f/2.8 . So , it 's a nice lens , especially for the price , but the autofocus just too slow ! I have 2 other Tamron lenses , the 17-50 f/2.8 and the 90 macro . Both of those are AF-D screwdriver lenses that use the AF motor in the body and both are much faster to focus than this lens with the built-in motor , especially in lower lighting conditions . I was really disappointed with the AF performance of this lens and returned it immediately . I usually like Tamron lenses , which are usually a good value , so I sincerely hope that Tamron fixes this lens so that the internal motor operates more in line with the speed of other lenses with internal motors . As it is , I think I could focus manually faster than with using the motor in this lens .	-1
I *really* wanted to love this lens , but I was NEVER able to get a clear image from it ( not an issue I have had with the four Canon lenses I own ) . The way it fit on my Canon 7D also felt slightly off - like it was n't creating a perfect connection . I sent it back . It did ( apart from unsatisfactory sharpness ) perform decently in low light . I think it would be fine for , say , real estate photography , but it was disappointing as a family photography lens .	-1
The pointer moves a way too fast . I could slow it down with the XP Control Panel but then this affects the touchpad pointer . Whatever I do , either the mouse is too fast , or the touchpad pointer is too slow . I installed the Logitch softare , and that did not help.Because of this , this mouse is useless on a laptop . I did not have any problems with older mice .	-1
As others have indicated - The picture shows xD STANDARD format card . I ordered this , wanting STANDARD and just received type M format cards . It appears these guys are not paying attention to any negative feedback .	-1
I tend to burn through/lose 3.5mm cables pretty frequently . I purchased this one mainly to use in my car with my iPod . After a few months , the white coating on the cord began to unravel , making it unusable.I would encourage you to instead consider spending a few extra dollars and getting the much better qualityBlueRigger 3.5mm to RCA ( 2 ) Stereo Audio Cable ( 8 Feet ) , which I purchased after this product . They are significantly better quality.I did give this item two stars instead of one because it worked fine while it lasted . If you need a cheaper 3.5mm cable that you wo n't be moving for anything ( like if you 're using it for desktop speakers ) , this may be something that would work for you .	-1
look the picture that i just upload.I just got the umbrella and I am not happy ! They lied on the title no matter how you get the tape around there is no 60 inches ! Just so you see why I 'm frustrated here is the example ... Why will I pay $ 39.99 on a 49 inches ( supposedly 60 ) if a 48 inches is 14.99 . HUM ? ? ? See for your self !	-1
I bought this camera for a friend of mine about to have a baby . Well I opened it for them this weekend to show them how to use it etc.. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed . The screen is the worst ! It appears to have about 4 pixels and has got the lowest refresh rate I 've ever seen . It 's quite hard to see what you 're taking a picture of , and you must stabilize and sit still for a moment before you can use it at all.The picture quality ... Well I only have my own camera to compare it to . The Elph SD100.. which has the same resolution as this camera.. so I expected the picture quality to be similar . Not so ! The pictures just seem so lifeless compared to my other camera . It also seems like it does n't compensate for lighting as well.Construction seems cheap.. it weighs about as much as a plastic disposable camera . I can not believe I wasted about $ 230 on this junk . I bought it before it was released thinking it was the latest and greatest from HP . Little did I know.. this camera was intended to break price barriers ... NOT performance barriers.One thing I will say . It is easy to use . Very very simple design and interface . ( too simple.. no good toys for the serious picture taker ) If someone writes up a good review for this camera , it has to be that they 've never used a quality digital camera before . Period . This thing is a dog ! If you 're looking for a cheap camera for a VERY simple point & amp ; click type person who does n't mind buying stock in Duracell.. and none too computer savey.. this camera will do . But I seriously would n't pay more than $ 100 for it .	-1
It definitely is not for LG DVD writers . I have an external firewire model and more than half of these have gone corrupt some time after actually being written to succesfully ! From other reviews here I would say you should check with your vendor for compatibility with this media . Some seem quite satisfied .	-1
I have purchased several hundred Memorex DVD+RW discs in the past few years and while I have had an occasional coaster most of the discs worked quite well on the Samsung DVD recorders ( two different models ) that I have used . My recent order of two 25-disc spindles resulted in my receiving two spindles of Memorex DVD+RWs with a Memorex label that was not the same that has been used on previously received spindles ( the label on the spindle was of a different design as was the imprinted design on each disc ) . The discs looked and felt different . I tried formatting 10 of these discs on both of the DVD recorders and neither of the recorders would work with the DVDs . The DVDs seem to be a completely different manufacture than the discs of the Memorex brand previously putchased . What can I say other than buyer beware . You can assume a certain quality from a brand name and then all of a sudden it is gone.This update on my comments is dated 1/10/2011.I notice that the current Amazon.com product description , for these discs , has been changed to say that the discs are `` for newer DVD+R/+RW drives '' . Make sure you have a newer drive ( whatever that means ) before you purchase these discs.Any of the reviews , written before mid-2009 , ( including the `` Most Helpful Favorable Review '' written 2004 , and the `` '' Most Helpful Critical Review '' written 2005 ) are referring to a quite different DVD+RW than the DVD+RW that is now being sold . My review states that the quality of the DVDs changed at some point in mid-2009 . If you read the reviews after mine you will see that there are a number of negative reviews with specificity and they are often followed by good reviews that say things like `` I purchased these DVDs and they are great '' . Maybe these are the people that have newer drives or maybe they have an incentive to write good things about products . I am suggessting that , if you have an older drive , buy these DVDs with caution - or do not buy them at all .	-1
Although a great bargain , the emulsion on these DVD-RW disks have uneven concentric markings , and a few had vertical flaws missing emulsion , rendering a 40 % usefulness . I use 4 different DVD drives , so this is n't a burner problem . I could understand a faster write-speed product ( requiring a higher laser output ) to have rewrite problems , but for these 4x speed disks , I would recommend another brand ( RiDATA disks have held up to 40+ rewrites successfully over several years )	-1
So , before I knew better , I bought a few packs of these on sale . After having a read a few reviews on here , I became a little concerned . `` Hmmm ... a lot of people that seem to know what they 're talking about seem to think that these Memorex DVD 's are dog feces ... I better check the stuff I recorded a few months ago on this . `` Well , I just did . I had 25 of these . I ran surface scans . 23 of them are now corrupted with uncorrectable areas in large swaths of sectors , even though visibly there is no blemish anywhere on the media surface . Most of the stuff I recorded on these is now unsalvageable.Folks , I know what I 'm doing . I recorded these DVDs and did full surface verifies before I stored them . They have n't been touched since . Now , they 're garbage . Conclusion ? The chemistry of the surface does not hold the encoding because these are garbage.DO NOT BUY THESE UNDER ANY CONDITIONS . Do what the smart people do : Buy Verbatim .	-1
Arrived early and in perfect condition . I bought this product because I thought I was about finished with converting a library collection to DVD ; then the library found four more boxes !	-1
Could never get this unit to work correctly . Had it too long to return it . Do n't buy it . There are much better things on the market now .	-1
My initial excitement was put down minutes after I found out , the little cool looking device does n't work well with my car ! ! ! You 'll have to put the unit right by the car antenna , which is unrealistic . I was very very disappointed . If you can try it out ahead of the time , do yourself a favorite and do it . Unless you like it so bad that you are willing to go through some modifications with your car by running antenna extension wire to the front and all that . ( I had an Integra and a TSX ) Volume sucks too .	-1
My first experience with iTrip was terrible hence the initial 2 star rating I posted here.However after reading the manual ( set volume to & lt ; 70 % ! ) and playing around with the right FM station ( iTrip stations ) for my car and creating a smart playlist to remove the iTrip beeps from playing in shuffle mode , I was finally able to make it work.In my home ( Onkyo ) system and in my Maxima ( Bose ) it works pretty well ( good digital tuners/receivers ) . But in my Civic it was n't so good ( cheap tuner ) . I checked the Belkin one but it was worse . Have n't tried the Monster iCarPlay yet but it maybe similar.Pros:1 . Seamless integration with iPod , its tiny and cool2 . Very convenient , no batteries , no wires , truly universal3 . Comes preset to 87.9 which is a good choice for most areas.Cons1 . The transmitter is not the strongest in the market and it can get easily overwhelmed by nearby stations2 . Its difficult to chage the stations other than 87.9 FM . I thinks its almost a hack . they should have integrated it with iPodOverall its a good product given the pros , however I wish I could make it work out of the box like other true Aplle products . So I will give it a 4 star now given other FM transmitter are no better .	-1
This device has weak power . Good luck if your car has one of the newer style antennas for the car . I was not impressed with the iTrip .	-1
okay from the beginning . The internal memory in the card allows for 8 shots . Yipee ! So I have to spend $ 30.00 on a card . Plus $ 7.00 shipping . I bought this because my Olypus was back at the factory . I should have waited for the Olypus to be returned ( which it has been no charge , in 3 weeks ) In my opinion , the photos are terrible worse if you use the kodak software . They are dark , the camera has to & quot ; charge & quot ; the flash between photos , ( which seems to take forever ) . The monitor is dark . The only good thing that came of this is a bought the camera printer dock . The can work with any digital photo on file . Beautiful shots ! No more going to the store to have a print made . Oh yes before I forget . I had to buy a card reader because my computer would not & quot ; see & quot ; the camera while on the dock . If I plugged in the camera directly , fine it saw it . Final thoughts , my late father would always say : & quot ; you get what you pay for. & quot ; Wise words from years from years ago . My first olypus digital lasted 5 years . My son is in New Zealand and he is still using it sending me beautiful photos . This is a & quot ; kiddie & quot ; camera . I let me 6 year old use it , without fear because if it breaks we lose nothing . When you start with nothing you have nothing to lose . Heed my advice , spend some money if you want some decent photos . I would not even recommend this to a teenager because they are way smarter than us adults . That 's all from videomanmark , a amazon.com pro seller .	-1
The viewer did not work when I first tried it . When I opened it to make sure I had installed the batteries correctly , one of the battery contacts broke off ! It reminded me of when `` Made in Japan '' was a euphemism for lousy products . Unfortunately , this one was made in New Jersey .	-1
When it works , it 's not bad . But it works so erratically I can give it only one star.I installed the batteries per the instructions . I pressed down the switch and slide together per the instructions . The light goes on about 1/3 of the time , and never stays on . I have a hard time believing something so simple could work so poorly . I tried to make it work for about 15 minutes , and gave up and returned it for a refund.I 'm just going to have to accept that you get what you pay for , and something so cheap is not going to work that well .	-1
I thought this was the adapter that will connect my 50mm 1.8 II to the front of my 28-105mm just like the other reviewer described and the seller . Just a waste !	-1
I 've had this backpack for a little over a year now . It was good for most of that time but a little over two weeks ago , when I was zipping up the main pocket ( that contains the laptop ) , the rubber tab you use to pull the zipper closed broke off . I was a little upset but since there were two zippers I did n't worry about it . Then , the next time I opened the bag with the second zipper , the second tab broke off as well ! Now I 'm stuck fighting the zippers to open and close them on the most used compartment of the bag.Another problem with the backpack is the reflective material the white stripes are made of . After about 6 months of use the material started flaking and falling off . Now , it 's nearly gone from around the main compartment . All that 's left is a little bit on the bottom of each side . It is n't really a big deal but worth mentioning.I carry about 15 pounds worth of stuff in this bag , my PC tool kit and laptop . Other than that I have a few cables.This is my first laptop backpack . I own a regular backpack that I 've had for 6 years that I paid 20 bucks for that is more durable than this one.At first I thought it was a good backpack and would 've given it 4-5 stars but I expected more out of it .	-1
Worked fine for a year but 2nd year I had it only would blow the fuse in the vehicle so do n't know if I would get another one .	-1
I have used this unit occasionally . Used for less than 10 hours total within year and half since I bought . Never overloaded or abused . I only hooked up my laptop to it . It just died ( blows the fuse when turned on ) .	-1
After two months of owning the SD-43HT , about half of my DVDs would not play . The display would read `` no disc . '' If I repeatedly turned the power off and on again I could get some of the discs to play.This system can play other region coded DVDs , but not all of them . Some of my Region 3s will not play , even before the DVD player broke . The DVD player also takes way too long to load a disc.The picture is lousy . Any bright red color will distort and jitter on the screen . The sound is n't much better than TV speakers . The subwoofer is boomy amd flat sounding and much louder than the rest of the speakers.The DVD player does not have audio outputs , so you ca n't play a movie without the speakers that come with the system . The digital input is too large so your optical cable just sits in the input and falls out if the DVD player is moved . If you connect another DVD player or game console to the SD-43HT through the digital input , the audio will go out of sync for any Dolby source . DTS plays fine though ... .Also , the video out connector is also loose so you ca n't get a signal to the TV without holding the cable . ( yes , I tried other cables ) The angle mark can not be turned off , which is VERY annoying if you have a disc with multiple camera angles . I read the entire manual ( horribly written , by the way ) and there is no way to remove the angle mark.Oh yeah , do n't buy this .	-1
The other two reviewers got it mostly right . But let me make it clear : this lightly moistened wipes can indeed remove fingerprints and dust -- and even prevent dust build-up for a few days . The problem is , when the cleaning liquid dries , it leaves ugly fog-like marks on your LCD screen . I 've found out that after it dries , using a lint-free soft cloth to lightly polish the screen helps clean up the screen completely . But then , I could have just used the cloth to remove cust and fingerprints.I think these wipes can be helpful when you have serious fingerprints or dirt ( not just dust ) on your LCD screen . Otherwise , for most people , this is just a waste of money and can actually make you frustrated .	-1
Should you purchase their product and in the future and need a replacment part ( something as simple as a cord ) you better hope your computer is on their approved list of manufacturers . Fujitsu is not . If your device is not listed ( the reason does n't matter ) , they will very politely refuse to sell you replacement parts ! And , do n't expect to see a list of approved devices before the sell . Ater they have your money in their pocket , you are playing their game.I think there is something illegal here but do n't have the time to deal with it . I will never give them future business !

Ok this was my first buy on amazon.. I bought 2 of the Tripp Lite TMC-6 TouchMaster Compact Surge Suppressor.. My nabor came to me and Gave me the box that was shipped . She found it at her front door , 2 houses up the street ! ( UPS ca n't read an address ) When I took out the 2 switch boxes , 1 did n't have any screws in it ( a friday special ? ) I needed them bad so I put my own screws in it.. so far they are working fine.. Not very pleased with my first buy from here..Oh and a week Later there 20 bucks now insted of 30 .	-1
This Sandisk Reader freezes my computer everytime I plug in a memory card to download . I thought it might be my computer so I reloaded the drivers and tried again . Same problem ! I thought it might be my ME operating system so I tried it on an XP computer . Same problem ! I called Sandisk and they said they would send me a FEDEX box to return it in . That was 8 days ago and still no return box . They also said it would take 7 -10 after they got it back . It looks like I 'm looking at being without a memory card reader for at least a month . Next time I 'm not buying electronics mail order . I 'm buying from a local store where I can return the piece of junk the next day and buy one that works so I can get on with my life .	-1
It did not work for me ... possibly because I have Win . 98 SE . San Disk 's tech support spent some time trying to help . Some possible reasons they gave for the problem were : I was using Win.98SE , using a USB hub , USB problems , fluctuation in electricity . Perhaps a friend may be able to use this card reader .	-1
If you get one that does n't have the `` no-keyboard '' firmware , it will start chirping the moment you plug it in . Only plugging a keyboard into the keyboard-labeled USB port ( Logitech wireless keyboards wo n't work in this port , for example ) or updating the firmware will stop it . A product should never beep unless there is something wrong with it . Think smoke alarms and the low-battery warning . Demerit one.Updating the firmware requires a complex installation of software on your PC and you ca n't easily remove it . Demerit two.In my case the firmware update failed on two separate computers essentially causing the unit to stop working entirely , so Belkin had to send me a replacement pre-updated . I am assuming there was a bug in the software , so I count that as a third demerit . I also had to pay return shipping . Four demerits.The unit requires power and there is a small DC connector in the corner , but the angled plug will either block one from using one of the USB ports or one of the DVI ports . Demerit five.Trying to get the last DVI cord is a challenge because the edge of the casing is too close to it . I had to push hard . Had I not be able to do so , I would have probably given up and just returned it as defective . Demerit six.For some reason , Belkin supplies a cover so the unit looks pretty when it 's on . Of course , you ca n't put it on once you have cables sticking out the back of it . Demerit seven.Obviously , this product was sloppily designed probably by different people who never talked to one another about each one was doing and no one at Belkin actually sat down and tried to use the product . I suspect they will get a lot of returns on the item and eventually be forced to discontinue it and design a new model . Ironically , Belkin 's products in general are n't all that bad , but with this one they bungled it big time .	-1
I received this KVM along with the MS Desktop Elite for Bluetooth ( mouse & keyboard ) Combo for Xmas . Upon installing the KVM with all the cables needed and the no-keyboard firmware update I came to find out that I could NOT switch between the two computers . The KVM just sits there with the 1st computer light blinking rapidly and pressing the buttons does NOT work . Other than the fact that it does n't not switch ( the entire purpose of a KVM ) this is a good product . The video , keyboard & mouse all work great on CPU1 input . I have emailed tech support but they have n't been very good at all with replying back to my messages ! ! DO N'T buy this !	-1
There are a lot of remote controls on the market from the $ 999.95 ( SRP ) Philips Pronto TSU7500 on down . I did n't want anything too fancy but I do need to control several devices . The PMDVR8 seems to work adequately ( for my needs ) with my Toshiba TV and Mitsubishi VCR . I was pleasantly surprised to have it operate at least some of my Kenwood A/V receiver/Tuner/Amplifier box ( I figure I can program the rest of the controls I need but I have n't gotten around to it yet . ) I was astounded when the remote control failed utterly to get any response from my HDRW720/17 DVR made by Philips - the same company that makes the remote ! The story gets worse . I 've tried to contact Philips customer service both by phone and on the web . So far I 've had inordinate delays , mechanical voice recognition systems that go on forever , been hung up on , and spoke to one person who barely spoke English and seemed to have an IQ of about 70 . Needless to say , they were n't helpful.I do n't expect to spend much money on ANY Philips products in the future ! Caveat Emptor .	-1
Bought this remote and what was n't found in the listed codes was easily programmed in `` Learn '' mode . Buttons are small but as with anything else , you adapt to it . One handy feature is the 3 `` Macro '' buttons you can program function sequences for `` 1 button '' control of multiple devices . I purchased 2 of these $ 29.99 remotes at Christmas Tree Shops for $ 4.99 . They had a bin full of them in the original human-proof packaging ...	-1
I bought this remote with hopes for use with all my home theater devices . I liked the design and the ability to change the buttons and display based on the device it was controlling was very nice and a great idea . It managed to control all the devices I wanted . However , it had one major design flaw that caused it to wind up in the drawer forgotten . You see , the buttons on the remote light up in whatever configuration is needed based on the device it is attempting to control and when not in use , the device is black as the buttons are n't lit up . When you pick the remote up , it lights up based on the current configuration . However , the remote is so sensitive to movement that even someone walking through the room causes it to light up . This results in extremely poor battery life and what good is a remote if every week you are replacing the batteries.It 's a cool design , but I would pass on this remote .	-1
I have both a Radio Shack brand weather radio model and this Midland WR-100 monster . The Midland has no way to adjust the alert tone , so if you use it in your office , 20 cubicles away co-workers are upset when the radio goes off . You can not set it to just turn on ONLY the voice by itself - you get the ear-splitting siren too . IF Midland made this so you could have ONLY the voice turn on at a low level , it would be OK . The Radio Shack model has a volume control for the alert tones and a volume control for the audio . The Midland volume control goes up by pushbutton steps , and even the lowest is way too loud . When you push a button , there is an ear-screetching 'beep ' - and I have not found a way to turn this annoying feature off . There is a jack labelled `` PC '' with no instructions how to connect this to your PC . The other jack labelled `` EXT . ALERT '' could use more information on how to hook it up to various accessories . In addition to a reasonable alert beep level adjustment , this radio could use a `` remote speaker jack '' , as it does not . It does at least have a remote antenna connection , which is a good idea . This radio just needs a lot of improvements , then it will be as good as the Radio Shack brand ( NOT this WR-100 radio from Radio Shack , but their own brand radio which has a dark-colored cabinet and many more adjustments . ) I feel bad for the people that buy these at their Kroger grocery store and then get home and find out it has problems . For those not getting any alerts , try setting the radio to `` ALL FIPS '' and then you 'll get every warning - if you do n't , then yours really is defective . Good luck , but there are better options out there , and I have n't had much luck with Midland on this radio . This is `` Not your father 's Midland Electronics '' Company - I wish it was . Regards , John	-1
I wish I could put down lower than 1 star this is a rip off you can not set crap with it all I could do is set the time and That is it . I can not set the channel for my weathe station no matter what so what a rip of I feel that my money was stolen on this ,	-1
Memorex DVD-R disks are manufactured by a comany named CMC , which has a well-deserved reputation for making horrible blank DVD media . The Memorex ones are no exception . You will have fairly decent success burning these at 2X , but if you try to burn them at 4X , you will get many read errors created on your burned disks . If you are backing up a DVD movie , these errors will probably be ignored by most standalone DVD players , but if you want to make a copy of a copy , most of these read errors will result in the inability to make a copy or your copy.The Memorex 4X DVD+R disks , on the other hand , are made by Ricoh , which makes very good disks . The Memorex 4x DVD +R disks are very good , and can be successfully burned at 4X.I have heard rumors recently , however , that Memorex 4X DVD +R disks , are being manufactured by CMC , which means that neither Memorex 4X DVD+R nor DVD-R disks will be any good.I would avoid the 4X DVD -R disks altogether , and be wary of the DVD +R disks .	-1
I bought this to use in my 2003 Infiniti G35 ( factory Bose system ) after trying three different types of FM transmitters ( all of which worked fine unless you were within 50 miles of any city with a poplulation over 10,000 ) .It just did not work , period.I took into work and tried it in my staff vehicle ( 2003 Dodge Caravan , factory system ) where it works OK . I brought the Sony adapter I had at work home and it works fine in the G35.However , the last time I was on a multi-hour road trip at work , I noticed the Belkin adapter is starting to make an annoying amount of mechanical noise . I may try to pop it open and see if there 's any way to reduce the racket it 's making , but I 'll probably end up buying another Sony . The Sony adapter I have is at least ten years old and still works OK .	-1
WOW ... what a piece of trash ! I like an ergonomic wireless keyboard/mouse combination and bought it for my computer at work but this model has little range away from the receiver . I was used to my standard Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard that came with my DELL computer at home . That has an enormous range and seems to be multidirectional . With the MS piece of junk , I was less than a foot ( 12 '' ) away from the receiver and neither the keyboard nor mouse was detected . Might as well go back to the wired mouse and keyboard . Very very unsatisfied ! Would not recommend this , even to Bill Gates ... A big waste of well needed funds ! !	-1
Modeled and promoted as a `` sport '' player for exercise use , with a `` rugged '' and rubberized look , I was looked into thinking this would stand up to the elements . I found out the truth this week when I got caught in the rain running with this on and had to run back 20 minutes in the rain . After about 10 minutes of light to moderate rain , the Rio stopped working . I 'm not talking about dropping it in a bathtub or swimming with it , I 'm talking rain drops bouncing off of it.When I got back inside , I could see water between the shell and the LCD screen . I immediately removed the battery and let it dry for several days and it appears that the rio will return to working OK now . Hope this lesson saves someone else potential headache.Rio 's software to work with it is poor . It does n't let you change the bitrate of songs from the computer to the Rio ( to save space for more songs on the Rio ) . It 's buggy : adding songs to a playlist results in wiping out the playlist and starting from scratch . And , unfortunately although the Rio is supported by Windows Media Player and Real Player , the support with each of them is also flawed in some way . I 've read good reviews of yet another player ( Red Chair ? ) that might work well with this but it is n't free and it does n't seem right to have to pay even a small price just to get the Rio to work the way it should out of the box .	-1
Caution ! It 's a LEMON ! I just want to add my 2 cents worth to all the other ( very truthful ) warnings already out there . I bought a Rio Karma , thinking it was a better priced player than iPod . Which it would be if it did n't turn into a paperweight in less than two days after purchase . For a paperweight it is a bit pricey . So , all in all , I would say it is overpriced.I returned it once the hard drive starting acting up ( one day after purchase ) and maddening little whirring sounds started to intrude on my listening pleasure ( loud little whirring sounds popping up in the midst of my tracks , every couple minutes , enough to give one a tick in the eye after a while ) . I 'm not an expert , but it seems like a terminal case of bad engineering to me ! Thanks to all the ( totally accurate ) negative reviews on Amazon , I did n't make the mistake of replacing it with another Rio `` bad '' Karma . Instead I took a deep breath and bought the higher priced iPod ( 20GB with docking station and remote included ) .I am now in love with my iPod . Happiest purchase of my life ! Nothing is perfect , but iPod comes pretty darn close ( I 've had it for 5 blissful months now , with no problems ... I even use it all day at work without any glitches or hitches ) . I recommend the iPod HIGHLY . I know it is spendy , and accessories add up ( but that is what Christmas is for , right ? ) . In spite of the cost , it is well worth it . The iPod works flawlessly , the music quality is wonderful . Who needs the aggravation of bad engineering when trying to enjoy hours of awesome music.Well , that 's my 2 cents worth . A big thank you to all those others who took the trouble to put their warnings on here . It saved me lots of further aggravation , without a doubt .	-1
Do n't shop there , they sent me an antenna extension instead , and then refused to send me the right one . Would n't even allow me to send it back . They stole my money do n't risk it .	-1
The switch is functional , but the images coming through are distorted and muddy at any resolution , and particularly at 1920x1080 . I have tried multiple different SVGA cables , and hooked it up to several monitors and video cards . Either the product I have is defective , or the product itself is generally poor .	-1
Summary - Do not buy this if voice quality matters.Background - This was purchased to plug into the single port of a Cable Voice Modem and split the line for the voice and the FAX.Detail - The FAX worked fine , but the Voice had a lot of static , so much that you could not understand what was being said.Recommendation - I would not recommend this .	-1
I purchased Plextor for what I thought was a quality product . However , now after about 18 months of not very heavy use it has failed ( I can no longer burn a DVD ) . So , while it worked better than a previous SONY DVD writer ( it never burned a single DVD ) the Plextor has not lived up to my expectations . So I can not recommend it .	-1
Received with non-functioning usb on port 2 . After reading reviews I 'm going to just cut my losses and go with a different device . Maybe go with a brand that I trust even though it costs a bit more . One star is too much .	-1
I bought two of these from Costco for use with my Linksys NSLU2 . The Linksys NSLU2 allows you to hook a USB drive up to it and share the drive across your local network . Everything worked great for about a week and then I started experiencing strange errors . I 'd get a delayed write failure or a network error stating that the network path no longer existed . At first , I suspected the Linksys device , since it is really responsibe for the network connection . However , after extensive testing ( including switching for another Linksys and switching to other USB Drives ) and reading other reviews that report the same error ( when hooking the drive directly up to a computer ) , I 've concluded that the problem must be the USB Drive itself . Fortunately , Costco has an extremely generous return policy , so I 'm taking this thing back ... .	-1
I did NOT receive my package ! Ca n't see any where where I can call or leave feedback . Post office was suspose to return it to Amazon . I do n't think they did because my credit card was n't credited ! Amazon how about an e-mail address when there is a problem !	-1
The first unit I bought in February skipped constantly when just playing DVDs , it was replaced . The second unit is now 6 months old ( and out of the 90 day warranty ) and the DVD tray will not even open although messages still appear saying `` loading '' , `` reading '' , `` no disc '' . Neither the remote nor the machine buttons work . Even when it did record , strange pauses kept appearing on the recorded disks . I have used it 20 times to record and about 10 times to play a DVD and it is now worthless	-1
Product is well-built and the drive fits in snugly . Has a cable that connects a second USB port to the power input of the enclosure.USB works well : the drive powers up with a simple USB connection and quickly appears in My Computer , ready for use.However , I bought the enclosure to be able to connect using firewire . On my laptops - Dell Latitude D630 ( WinXP ) and Dell XPS M1330 ( Vista business ) - the drive is not recognized when connected using firewire . Without a power supply , the drive will not power up at all when connected with firewire . With a power supply ( USB power cord provided or AC adaptor ) the blue light goes on but the computer does not detect the drive at all . Thought it was a Vista problem ( all documentation stops at XP ) but it did n't work with the D630 ( using a cardbus firewire adaptor ) .Annoyingly enough , no information is given on the exact AC adaptor needed.Other HD enclosures using firewire have worked on both computers.Rated low as you would be better off getting an enclosure with just the USB connection .	-1
I 've had two of these enclosures . Both of them failed within a few months . Suddenly the computer ( Mac Powerbook G4 for the first one , Macbook Pro for the second one ) was telling me that the drive was not readable . I ran diskwarrior and a bunch of other utilities , even took one of the drives to my mac guru technician . I managed to restore the directory on one drive and it 's still humming away happily in a competitor 's enclosure . The other drive was kaput , data never recoverable ( but the drive , reformatted in a new enclosure , works perfectly fine . ) I blame the enclosure . I have a dozen or so other external firewire drives and never a failure . So to Macally , I say you fooled me twice with your cheap piece of junk , but never again .	-1
Do not buy this enclosure if you intend to use a Seagate 300 GB Barracuda drive and probably similar drives . Macally does n't tell you this in advance . To make matters worse , I contacted tech support and was told that I could return the power supply at my own expense and THEN they would send me a replacement . This exchange would require weeks . I might have been willing to accept a replacement if they had offered to send me the power supply immediately . I 'll return the Macally 100AC and look for a more reputable company .	-1
I bought this CD recorder several years ago . At that time , it was about the only CD recorder available . I suppose that 's because most people use their computers to make their CD compilation disks . But I do n't make mixes that way , so I needed a CD recorder.My biggest complaint about this CD recorder is that it has ruined so many CD-Rs . I 'll record the whole 70 or so minute CD , hit finalization , it will count down the 1:04 of finalization , get to the last second and say `` Incomplete ! '' The manual says this is due to vibration , but there is no vibration around . This repeated trouble has made me hate this machine.The second complaint is that whenever I want to use it , even after several years , I have to refer to the owner 's manual , and often I still have trouble figuring out exactly what I have to do.Here are my recording practices . First , I do n't want to record from computer because my music files are compressed ( I do n't have enough hard drive space to not compress them into AAC format ) . Second , I like to make music mixes that are intermixed , with one song starting before the other one is finished . This , too , can be done on computer with DJ programs , but again , the music is compressed . So I record all my music on my stereo system 's Mini-Disc recorder . Unlike CD , MD is a dream to record on . After recording , I can divide , combine , and move tracks , and there 's no such thing as finalization ... I can do this any old time I please . After my music mix is perfected , then I record it onto CD so I can put it on my computer and play the CD in my car . So at least when the CD recorder says `` Incomplete , '' I have n't lost my music mix , just some time and yet another wasted CD.I ca n't even imagine trying to record a compilation CD on this thing . I have made some direct CD-to-CD recordings within the machine using program play , but only with minimal programming , and certainly only with the maximum of 5 discs the play deck can hold ( rather than trying to do a second program or adding tracks individually ) . But every time I want to use program play to record , I have to review the instructions . My Mini-Disc recorder , on the other hand , is easy to use . ( It 's also a Sony , and I love my Mini-Disc recorder . I hate this CD recorder . )	-1
Update 11/24/07Yes , it took me a long time to provide my update . Sorry.I did take this unit back , but did n't bother trying another one of the same . I bought the TEAC CD-RW880 CD Recorder instead . It does the job and it works with no glitches . What more can I say ? =======================================================================I had read all of the Pro and Con reviews . But , since most of the negative reviews were a bit dated , I thought I would be reasonably safe now and decided to purchase the RCD-W500C , with some trepidation . Oops . Started it up yesterday and , essentially , the unit will not record . Period ! The unit does not seem to recognize any signals to the `` Deck B '' ( CD recording ) side . External analog signals do n't activate the recording level meter at all . And , neither do signals from the `` Deck A '' ( CD playback ) side . Yes , the cables are connected properly . Yes , I am going through an audio receiver . Yes , I am using Audio CD-R CD 's . The `` Deck A '' does play pre-recorded CD 's correctly . Since the unit is new out of the box , it 's going back for replacement ( Circuit City ) . If still no good , I 'll try a different manufacturer . And , I will provide an update.By the way , negative comments about the Operating Instructions are all on target . Even if the unit is operating correctly , you must read the whole thing carefully to avoid mistakes . In my case , it did n't matter . The manual is unclear and not well organized . Pertinent information is scattered throughout.Caveat emptor ! Not recommended.Therck	-1
I purchased this softbox because of the glowing reviews on Amazon.Pro : Simple , almost elegant design.Worked great right out of the box as promised ( unlike two other softboxes ) Very easy to set up and take down.Light weight.Beautiful light.Con : Umbrella material is super thin feels delicate and cheap.Folded metal edges are sharp.Diffusion material feels , smells , and looks like light-weight translucent PVC shower curtain from Walmart.Construction of umbrella joints and stitching is sloppy.A carry case does not come with this item - something which is included in just about every other photo product I have purchased on Amazon and elsewhere . $ 192.52 ( shipped to me ) and Wescott could n't include a nylon drawstring bag for minimal storage and protection requirements ? ( Wescott : so cheap we squeak ) Conclusion : I would not recommend this light modifier to anyone looking to build a lighting kit . While the light is good , the craftsmanship is shoddy . Lack of a simple bag for carry and/or storage is thoughtless and shows a lack of respect for the product and the customer 's investment .	-1
I 've owned two Toshiba DVD players before , and have generally been happy with them . But this one arrived damaged ( vertical bands of `` snow '' on the screen when playing DVD or DVD-R media ) .	-1
This lens cap was a replacement for one that fell off and was lost while walking around -- a problem I 've heard others complain about with Nikkor lens caps . The squeeze release gets the lens cap off quickly and gives a good hold while removing it , but does n't engage reliably .	-1
If you 're using Windows 7 on a modern PC , do n't bother . It wo n't be recognized and will just drive you nuts .	-1
The USB cord of the cooler on the device end wore such that it does n't receive power unless I force the cord to bend at a hard angle , by stacking books on the end or so . And sometimes it 'll slowly bend out of that angle and stop receiving power . This completely defeats the purpose of the device and is extremely frustrating .	-1
I bought this in Jan 2013 and used it non-stop to cool our wireless router . After about 14 months of continuous use the fans started becoming very noisy . I would occasionally use some compressed air to clean the dust out of it , but after 14 months , nothing seemed to help it . Being in the same room with it would set my teeth on edge . Might be okay for occasional light use , but not continuous .	-1
This item was never a good fit . I originally bought it for a Macbook but it did n't fit on the nubs right . I then used it with an Acer laptop I was using as a HTPC . It was a bit loud when on the highest speed and the blue light was annoying . It also shorted in a month.I guess maybe if you have a larger laptop and will not use this very often , it might work for you . However if you need a workhorse or something for a smaller computer this is not the item for you .	-1
I have an after market handle that serves as a lift for my computer to allow the bottom of it to breath , but it still does n't cool it enough , and the fans still come on . So , I thought the Notebook Cooler might do the trick . One of the features that I was excited about were the really quiet fans that are supposed to blow away the heat from the bottom of the computer.Well , the fans are n't quiet , and it does n't cool off my computer . In fact , the fans were as loud , or louder than my notebook 's fans . It also is n't very smart . You have to turn it on and off manually , instead of having a sensor that detects heat . The fans are loud , the internal design is lacking , and it really does n't cool off the computer that much . In fact , it just blows warm air towards you if you 're sitting next to it . About the only thing that 's good about this is the aesthetic design . It 's cool looking , but not worth your money or your time .	-1
The fan was noisy , and inside it collects lots and lots of dust . The blue LED light was anoying yet I learned to live with it . The quality of the product is very poor . The USB joint was not functional for another device ( say a mouse ) and it went broken within a few months .	-1
If you want a USB notebook cooler that 's going to last a few weeks with minimal use , go right ahead . The plastic feet came off , the power light is a blue/purple strobe that could compete with local law enforcement , and the dual cords ( power/USB ) is cumbersome .	-1
A pure piece of JUNK ! ! ! Do n't waste your money here ! ! !	-1
This thing was really underwhelming . It might be to wind up a ball of yarn , but electrical cables ? Forget it !	-1
Very time consuming and frustrating to use . If you read some of the other reviews they will recommend using a zip tie to hold the middle of the cord so you can wind both ends evenly . While this does work , pulling the cord to use it is way more time consuming than it 's worth and after only a week it was starting to damage the casing on the cord - aYellow Jacket 12/3 Heavy-Duty Extension Cordwhich is not some cheapo cord . This product was definitely not well thought out . Eventually I got sick of spending more time trying to wind the cord than I was actually using the tools so I went back to using the over-palm-and-under-the-elbow method . Also , I found this same exact item in L0we 's for two dollars cheaper . All I can say is this is a waste of plastic .	-1
This is a borderline toy . It may hold 150 ' of zip cord but that 's about all . A more realistic max would be 75 ' of 12/3 .	-1
If you just want to store a seldom used cable , this may work just fine , and the price is pretty low . However , if this is a cable you use frequently , it is a real pain-in-the-butt to always be forced to unwind this reel so you can plug one end into a receptacle , and the other into your device . Spend a bit more , get much better utility .	-1
The whole computer locks up ! ! ! Ca n't open any program or look at the device manager.To shut down I have to use the power supply switch.The XP install wizard does n't open defiantly not plug & play.I called tech service the driver on they 're site is the same one on the CD which is dated 4-2004 .	-1
My SD-V391 was a gift that sat around until my daughter wanted to use it . She called and said Closed Captioning does n't work when playing a DVD . I played the DVD on my home theater and it worked fine . I did all the troubleshooting that Toshiba told me but no CC . They claimed that if it worked while playing a tape then it should work with a DVD . I see the Model was replaced with the SD-V392 so I suspect they knew about the problem and discontinued selling the SD-V391 .	-1
I always buy B+W filters for all my lens and so far have loved every one of them . This one though does n't live up to my expectations . It 's small , 43mm , to go on my Canon EOS M 22mm lense . The fit is ok , but it adds a lot of length as in it 's threaded section is of a standard thickness , which on a lense this small adds a lot , and since it makes the lense cap sit so much further out , I can see it putting unnecessary pressure on the focus drive since it moves in and out . Very slight pushing on this and you can see it moving . In a bag I can see this added length causing the lense to be forced too far into itself.And then there 's the flare . I was in a concert venue last night during a band practice and pulled out my camera to test it 's low light capabilities . There was LED lights back lining the stage but not aimed anywhere directly at me . There was horrible flare in the camera , and it was n't just because I had it at the perfect angle . As I angled the camera around the flare moved all over but never went away . I thought it could be the camera period so I removed the filter and all flare was gone . Angled it around and nothing . Put the filter back on and there 's the flare again . As I walked the floor I continued to pick up flare from different angles.I truly believe it could be just this filter 's size , I do n't know . I do know filters of low quality do flare easily thus why I bought this over the many cheaper options . For this size , this was the most expensive . I 've shot on my 5D with other lens with filters in this same venue with less of a problem . ( yes , at the right angle any lense or filter will flare in this environment , but not like this . ) For me , this filter does n't cut it for the price when looking at the thickness and flare issue .	-1
This filter is was no good to me . I shoot with a dslr and uv does not effect it . I thought I would use it to protect my lens but I get glares , specially when shooting around light . With todays cams , this is a complete waste of money..	-1
I can understand that this filter wont hold a common cap , lets say a Nikon original 72mm cap , because its very slim . But for me , the fact that the B & W cap that COMES WITH THE FILTER does n't works neither is A FRAUD . What a joke ! ! ! B & W must alert you for the fact that there 's NO cap that holds on it . BIG desing mistake . Big shame . If you need a CPL for continous outdoor use , DONT BUY THIS SLIM CPL .	-1
Very disappointed with this filter . I was expecting a lot less colorcast than what I got . Go with Lee filters and get the bigstopper !	-1
This backpack is definitely big . . . I have one of the largest notebooks on the market and there is extra room on each side of the notebook pocket.The problem for me is that the amount of padding between the notebook pocket and the back of the pack is paper-thin . . . I need something more substantial to protect my notebook when it 's in an overhead bin on a plane or wherever . Unfortunately I have to send this back.I 've saw a large Targus backpack at Best Buy that appeared to be better quality , thicker padding , mesh , etc . I was thinking this was that model but evidently they make a cheaper version of their larger laptop backpack .	-1
Pros : -Size : I carry around a 17.2 '' laptop , lots of books for school , and laptop accessories . This bag is big and that 's what I wanted.-Attractiveness : This , of course , is subjective . I like the colors and look of it and the logo is simple.Cons : -Price : you can certainly pay more for a backpack , but the price seems a bit steep for the quality.-Shoulder straps : I read other reviews of people complaining about the tendency for the straps to slide off the outside of their shoulders . I 'm just shy of 6 ' and have broad shoulders so I thought I 'd take a chance . At first there was no problem , then I loaded the backpack a few times and noticed the slippage . Upon inspection , the material around the straps has stretched , after only a couple weeks . This kind of defeats the purpose of it being so big.-Zippers : the zippers seem to be of moderate durability , no issues yet . However , it 's been a little annoying that the zippers go all the way to the bottom of the bag . Some people might like this.-Waist strap : completely useless . Is this supposed to be for support , like a cumberbun ? It 's too thin to be comfortable for support and as I already stated , this bag is not really made for much weight . My complaint is that you cant detach them.-Laptop protection : I 'm not familiar with many laptop carrying cases , but the padding seems to be a bit lite . More importantly , the bag provides protection in terms of padding , not structural support . With the laptop compartment located right against the back , the laptop is essentially holding the bag rigid . When I have books in the bag , the laptop is keeping the bag upright against my back , bearing the weight of other things in the bag . The whole point of buying this was to protect my laptop.Up in the air : -Durability . The shoulder strap assembly has already stretched and there is one other area toward the top where the seam is stretching , so I 'm not very optimistic . Time will tell how long this thing holds up . I 'm skeptical about the material used on the blue are of the bag.-Overall design . So far I have not utilized all the compartments , so I may yet find some use for the overall layout . The very front portion of the bag is held up by clips , but is firmly attached at the bottom . Why ? I sense that this backpack was designed with a mishmash of ideas incoherently thrown together into one design . I have a feeling that a lot of unnecessary straps are put there just for aesthetics . Personally , I 'm not impressed and find something appealing because it 's functional not because 'it 's cool because it looks kinda like a backpacker 's backpack . 'I ca n't say I regret buying this just yet because it 's doing its job . I needed a backpack for my laptop and not many are big enough for the larger screens . I have a feeling I 'll be updating this sometime in the next few months for news on something significant tearing .	-1
After ordering this bag , I remembered why I sold the first one . It does n't have near the room that is advertised . If you think you can pack it as an overnight bag , your next days clothing ca n't be larger than swim trunks of bikini.The whole bag is unbalanced . I have a 17.3 & # 34 ; notebook , and although I place it in the right pocket , when the handle is let go , teh bag falls face forward ( handle is up in the air ) . The handle is very flimsy , and is of little use , as once you let go , the bag will fall over . Not much more to say ... I do n't like the bag and am mostly wirting this so that the next time I am looking for a bag , I will hopefully see this and avoid buying it yet a third time .	-1
This card seemed like the perfect solution to my desire to play VHS movies on my computer monitor . Unfortunately , my ( new ) computer 's video card is not compatible with the ATI TV Wonder Pro . After contacting ATI and fiddling around with software drivers , etc . I found that I need an ATI or compatible video board . Of course , they fail to mention this in their advertising or on the packaging . It would sure have saved me a lot of time had they published this in their specifications . The card seems like it does everything except wash windows , but check out your hardware before buying .	-1
I had the worst 2 day of my life trying this # $ % $ & card work.The quality is so poor and I tried to fix everything . Finally , reading the reviews I realized that it 's not an installation or a computer problem , it 's a product problem and an incomplete description from ATI for the system requirements.BIG BIG DISAPPOINTMENT .	-1
This is possibly the biggest piece of junk Ive ever purchased.A background - I am an IT Pro - I have 17 years experience with computers , the last 10 of which in a professional office setting . Ive built and sold high performance gaming systems for the last 5 years . Ive worked with all kinds of hardware.I found one of these cards at a store on sale and thought I would give it a try.What a disaster . This thing is a hideous piece of garbage , ATI , you should be ashamed to stamp your logo on it . Not knowing alot about the product I trusted ATI 's reputation of quality that it would work somewhat like they claimed . Not hardly.Installation was horrible - the install routine was broken - meaning it did not work like it was supposed to , and unless I had tried a similar ATI product a while ago you would n't even know it.Once i finally did get all the crap software installed , none of it worked properly . My system is no slouch - AMD 2800+ , 1GB Ram , 40GB RAID 0 - etc . The ATI software felt like it was written by a co-op student from bangladesh . It crashed alot . The install routine did not even work properly . The video that displayed was choppy at best , interupted frequently by an annoying & quot ; glitch & quot ; - i cant even describe it . Just try to imagine recording something on a vhs tape you found at the bottom of a lake - thats what the quality might look like.Needless to say , after many other headaches and issues , I have taken the card out , packed it up and will definetly return it in the morning . Whatever you do - DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE CARDS !	-1
This product is pretty good when it works . Unfortunately that is not often enough to get it a good rating . I am a computer engineer by trade and I know how to run a network . The NetGear WGT624 is a piece of junk . If you plan on using the wireless connectivity you better leave the router where you can get to it easily as you will be rebooting it frequently.If you google up WGT624 and CRASH you will see what I mean . Also note that the amazon ratings show more one star reviews than all the good review combined . That is unusually bad for an Amazon score.This router crashes , Netgear has known about it for over a year and they do NOTHING . Not only do I hate this router , but I doubt I will by Netgear again .	-1
I 've only had mine a few days , but that 's been enough time for me to become completely dissatisfied and to return the unit.The major problem I had was performance - using an older Linksys gateway , I routinely achieved throughput of 5800kb/sec ( cable modem to my cable provider 's test site ) . With the Netgear , I averaged 60kb/sec , even on the hard-wired ports ... that 's nearly 100 times slower than my old Linksys unit and barely faster than dialup ! Netgear proved unable to find the problem , or even to suggest a plausable explanation . I happen to be a networking expert and after spending many hours with the Netgear unit , I could find no other explanation other than some type of internal problem to explain the problems I was seeing . I did try exchanging the unit for another just in case my results were a fluke , but I had exactly the same result.By the way , the unit does seem to run abnormally hot : I measured the surface temperature on mine to be nearly 120 degrees in spots . Internal chip temperatures must be higher still ... ca n't see how a device like this will have a long life running at these temperatures , especially if installed in an environment having poor cooling or air circulation.Taken all together , I ended up returning the unit and trying another brand .	-1
Ordered this on Amazon , used of course , from Sell_your_own - got the camera , but no power supply . Not sure what I 'm going to do about this . SUCKS TO BE ME I Guess	-1
Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY any X10 products . Their customer service never answers any emails and there is no phone number for this company . If you can find one , please let me know what it is . When the program is working , it works ok at best . When it stops working , good luck with getting customer support for help .	-1
I bought some X10 Cameras and they had serious interference . X10 Tech could not provide a solution so I had to send them back.I had to pay return shipping even though the X10 Cameras would not work properly . Every other company I have done business with will pay return shipping if their product is defective but not X10.I will not purchase anything from X10 again .	-1
They could have been the most perfect 2.1 speakers , but when the unwanted pops and clicks started I just wanted to give them away to get rid of the noise . They are very powerful the wired remote is a plus for me , because my children tend to loose my remotes . They are easy to setup and I have no problem with the size and placement of the speakers in my computer setup . But the poping and clicking is driving me crazy . I must turn the speakers off when not using them or the poping and clicking will remind me to trun them off . It 's not the speakers I have switched from right to left and the noise is still there . I have shut down the computer and detatched the speaker cord fromt the soundcard and the noise is still there . The problem is with the amp itself . I will contact tech support and see if I can RMA them . It 's a shame that this set of speakers are rated THX and they suffer from a poor electrical design . Now I must spend more money and purchase another pair of speakers from another manufactor .	-1
I researched these speakers EXTENSIVELY before purchasing them . As is the case here , the vast majority of the user reviews on the various online merchant web sites are all extremely positive . The professional reviews , however , are more accurate . Read on if you want to know why this system is getting RMA-ed.Most professional reviews that I located viewed this 2.1 speaker system quite favorably , but ALL mentioned one significant fact - the speakers have NO mid-range ... .and , in my experience , it 's true . The idea of a down-firing mid-range on each satellite was sheer genius . The approach allows the speakers to be small and elegant with a stealth mid-range that also provides a low center of gravity so that the sats do not tip over ( a common problem for tall and narrow sats ) . Yes , sheer genius ... in the design phase . In practice , the down-firing mids do not work as advertised . The design leaves the mid-range completely empty and you are left with a WAY overly aggressive bass sub and bright , BRIGHT tweeters . No amount of fussing with the bass and treble controls will solve this problem . I constantly found myself reaching for the controls trying to tone down the aggressive bass and the PIERCING tweeters ... all to no avail.Okay , I knew this was going to be a problem when I purchased them ... these facts were clear in all the professional reviews . `` So what ? `` , I figured . These are not very expensive and they just look so darned good . So I gave them a shot.They arrived and I was incredibly impressed with their design . The wiring is ingenious ( and unobtrusive ) and the controls are within easy reach ( and that 's a good thing because of the aforementioned issues with the sound range ) ... .and yes , they looked FANTASTIC next to my flat panel and small Shuttle cube . So , after I finished fiddling with the knobs , did I decide to keep them ? Absolutely no way , and it had nothing to do with the mid-range.As another reviewer pointed out , the sub emits a constant low frequency signal whenever the speakers are turned on . This is not a defect in one or two pairs ... it is a design defect . Altec would have you believe that it is normal and states as much in the user manual , but I have never heard another sub do the same . The noise is not just distracting , it is maddening . The actual problem is that the sub design did not adequately insulate the input power source from the input audio source ... so you end up listening to a gut-penetrating version of your house 's AC current when you are not putting an audio source through the system.I leave my speakers on all the time when I am using my computer ... regardless of whether or not I am listening to music . In fact , they are on the same power strip and come on automatically . That way , I get to hear all the other windows feedback ( beeps , new mail tones , etc. ) . I found myself constantly turning these speakers off lest I start to go insane from the hum.BTW , I am not an audiophile and these issues still stood out . The hum was noticed by others the moment that they walked into the room . `` What the heck is that ? '' was a common response.Without the hum , these are 4 star speakers . No mid-range is an issue , but hey , they look great and are not very expensive . With the hum , however , they are one star at best.Now where is that UPS man ? Today , I have a package for HIM . : )	-1
First of all , I want to say that I have been having these speakers for more than a year in past.First , it 's the most ridiculous design I have ever seen . Did n't notice that when I was buying unfortunately.Cons:1 ) Mid-range speakers are pointed downwards ( ? ? ? ) . Question : W T F ? Of course you can expect lose of mid range frequencies because of that.2 ) you might think because these speakers have 2 tweeters each , the high freq would be nice.. no way , they managed to fail even here.3 ) Subwoofer is simply terrible , the worst I have ever experienced actually.These speakers ' `` red '' price should be $ 30 . IMHO.Now I am a happy owner ofKlipsch RB-61 II Speakers , of course this is a different price range . But just wanted to suggest for those who can afford . These are the best speakers I have had so far .	-1
You 'll get the switch , you 'll love it and write a great review . Then in a few weeks or months it will start going flakey . Eventually it will die completely . You 'll hate it . Do us all a favor and wait a few months before you a write a breathless review about how great this is , and you 'll save a lot of people trouble . Cisco should be sued over the uniformly poor quality of these switches.Here 's a hint : if a company like Cisco wo n't put their name front and center on a product , it 's probably because they 're cutting corners . LinkSys is the brand Cisco uses when they want to sell crap but do n't want to tarnish their own image . Real IT people know the LinkSys is Cisco 's code for `` we really phoned in this one . ''	-1
Real quickly , I 'm a network administrator for one of the largest websites in the US , so I 'm not clueless when it comes to these devices . Like all the positive reviewers here , I was very happy with this unit when I first bought it . Worked like a charm , fast , cheap - what more could I ask for ? Well how about a unit that did n't go belly up due to Linksys cutting corners on parts ? Apparently some versions of the SD2008 and SD2005 had fans , but they have been cut out . Now these little buggers overheat , and when they do , it can cause capacitors to go bad which basically kill it 's ability to operate in gigabit mode . In fact , several of my computers ( and I 've tried all sorts of NICs/computer combos ) just repeatedly drop connection in a neverending loop . Nice work Linksys.I 've read on forums that many others have the exact same problem - usually takes months for it to show up . One guy actually tore his apart , and saw the blistered/bulging components that had overheated and replaced them ( hope you 're handy w/a soldering iron . )	-1
I bought 2 of these units , and in 6 months they both started failing within one month of each other . DO NOT BUY ! ! ! Ports start dropping randomly and then just fail altogether .	-1
I 've yet to figure out why , but a couple of months ago my computer lost all network access when talking with this switch until I change to 100MB , and even then that was n't consistent . Same reaction to both ports on my PC . I have n't added anything to the switch to cause this trouble , nor have I used new drivers . The switch must have gone bad ( bought less than a year ago ) . Others on the net are having similar troubles . Sad .	-1
I loved these speakers when I had them . bought them in feb 2012. then about a few months ago , I noticed one speaker ( one with the volume control ) has diminished greatly and the sound is greatly unbalanced . only the speaker without the volume control is working perfectly . every time I increase volume , the non volume control speaker gets heard and it is very much louder than the other . I still use them because one speaker is better than no speaker . and the sound quality is pretty good , just wished I could listen with balanced sound . I will use these speakers until the other speaker blows out .	-1
I am a bit of an audiophile and have had tons of different home , car and theater speakers over the past 10 years . This pair was not meant to be anything special . It was only meant for occasional use with my laptop ( which has an X-fi soundcard and sounded fine with my old speakers ) .Unfortunately , the speakers sound awful . I would be upset if I paid 10 dollars . There is no depth to the sound and I have heard better sound quality from speakers that come free bundled with desktops . I wish I was n't too lazy to return them , but alas , I am .	-1
ive owed creative t40 's logiteck x530 's 14 dollar alte lansing speakers , , bottom lline I paid 30 dollars for these , I wouldnt pay a dime more , there ok but Id invest in something better , 100 dollars would be a joke even 50 is to much , sometimes the sound remines me of soup can lid speakers , the bass cutoff is noticeble , maybe these are good for youtube , I think the price is to jacked up ,	-1
In a nutshell , this product is a complete waste of money . I have purchased an MVIX760HD that I absolutely love.Pros : Ca n't really think of any.Cons : Horrible slide show presentation - even though the original images are of fairly high quality ( 3000x2000 ) , they look terrible on every monitor I tried.The software that comes with the unit must have ADMIN access or the software will not load . I never run my system with admin access unless installing software . This being said , I doubt it would work at all with vista.If you want a decent product that works , get the mvix . It 's worth the extra $ $ .	-1
This is not a real canon product . Falls off easily and is nowhere near as durable . What a waste of $ 10 .	-1
This is the worst UV filter I have ever used . I bought it for a new lens primarily as a protective piece , and since the filter is not coated , using this filter ruins almost all of my outdoor shots with nasty green reflections . Before I purchased this filter , I did not really know that UV filters could produce such awful results since I just buy them , screw them on , and forget about them . This particular Canon brand UV filter is absolutely worthless . I have since removed it , and am going to purchase a different filter.In short , do n't waste your time with this filter . Purchase another brand for your lens . Canon generally makes awesome products , but they really missed the mark with this one .	-1
This filter does n't fit for Canon SX20IS . Do n't buy it if you have this camera ! ! !	-1
These filters are OK for the price , that 's pretty much it ... As a filter , they somewhat block glare , but the sharpness is compromised and sometimes the camera will even try to focus on the filter itself if a spot is there . The build quality is another story . The plastic ring around the glass is n't tight enough , so it leaves `` wiggle '' room for the glass to click back and forth ( about 1mm in either direction ) , I 'm not sure if this is normal or not . Not Recommended ... buy yourself a multi-coated Hoya filter , they 're the best of the best .	-1
You do n't want your filter holder to add ugly vignetting to your shots , do you ? Thus you need to have this item in your bag because the regular Cokin P Filter Holder ( 3 threads ) adds tons of vignetting anytime you shoot below 28-30 mm . I got one but still experienced some issues using it : - Below 24-26 mm , there still is vignetting when one has to slightly tilt the filter holder to match the horizon line : ( - Edges of this item are so sharp , one could injure one 's hands , especially when doing those waterscape shots in cold weather ! I 'd recommended to smooth'em with sandpaper or ... to shoot with gloves but you know how inconvenient it is : ( - Because it holds only 1 filter , well , you ca n't combine others -- obvious but ... true : ( Turnarounds : i . If you have not purchased filters yet , I 'd recommend to avoid the P size and go for Z or X sized filters . Even better , do n't use a filter holder , hold your filters in hand like the pros ! Takes a bit of practice though.ii . If you already own P size filters , and if you can afford it , go for a better design/built -- ca n't tell which brand but figuring out yourself should n't take to long ...	-1
I have used this with both RG6 coax cable and an extension cord and in both cases , I just find it clumsy to use . It 's hard to get the cable and/or cord wrapped evenly around the wheel . Also , when you turn the handle , the end that you have fed thru the middle turns and twists ... not good . There 's not enough clearance between the handle and the ground so that also adds to the clumsiness .	-1
Camera quality is disaster . It badly fits in the hands , it unsteady and cumbersome to operate . The image quality is so-so . Mid-tones are very poor , color rendering as a cartoon film like . All colors are & quot ; pop up & quot ; , it is not a photography tool to my view . I have tried it against 5M Sony f717 and it blew it out of water in every aspect . Moreover , the & quot ; stretched & quot ; to 6M images from Sony are looking better . The 18-50 & quot ; lens & quot ; is so embarrassing that Canon should be ashamed to market such khe-khe , lens ( with failing front element and unsteady focus ) . Some one has be really inspired by Canon 's advertising movies to pay $ 1000 for such & quot ; camera & quot ; . It new feels like came out of trash box.Before review it , I would recommend take it in to the hands and try along with something else .	-1
I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.Do n't expect much from it and you will be happy . As an entry level DSLR it does what it 's supposed to do in ideal conditions . I find it 's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving.Cons : In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it 's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.Battery dies FAST . The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in RAW mode . I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode ( Approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . Surprisingly when shooting jpegs , I get more shots per charge ( Over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . I can not tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike . So I always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty Elan 7 ) .The viewfinder is very dim . When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D 's viewfinder . In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus.Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . When shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.The 420EX flash is supposed to `` talk '' to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . However , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.After about five months , the shutter button started sticking . I would click it and then it would remain depressed . The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . And since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . For example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance.So would I recommend this camera : If you are a casual point and shoot person , it 's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos . But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere .	-1
I try to be fair in my reviews . I genuinely want to help others decide whether or not I thought the product was of quality construction , met expectations , and reasonably priced . There are times , though , when I am dumbfounded by the praise lauded on a product I purchased only to be left wondering who thought this was such great buy . This is one of those times.PROS : It is built well , I will say that . Padded nicely . Definitely seen worse . I have no doubt it can protect valuable and delicate camera gear within reasonable expectations . I do think it 's also stylish without trying to look `` designerish '' . It 's a nice balance between looks and utility.CONS : Put simply , I have tried multiple configurations and still can not figure out how anyone could possibly cram as much gear into this bag as they claim they have . It 's like Tetris . I have a 5DmkIII w/grip , 24-105 , 50mm , and 28-135mm . Plus all hoods , plus a Yonguo560 flash , not mention all caps , cleaning stuff , filters , batteries , cards , etc . Are you kidding ? The bag is NOT that big . And you can also fit a laptop on this ? Uh uh , not happening . Just because it has a Canon logo on it does not make it a great purchase . For my purposes , it 's just too small.I 'm not going to talk you out of it , I do n't think it 's a bad buy . I do think it 's not suited to accommodate the needs of a pro as the plurality of reviews make it out to be . You should n't have to stuff your gear , it should be snug , yes , secure , yes , not pushed in so tight you risk breaking something . If you 're an amateur shooter with modest equipment needs this might work for you . If you have serious gear and rely on it to make a living , might want to keep looking .	-1
I agree that when playing after recording it & trying to FF it will always jump to the end which was nerve-wracking . Also typing in the title or name ... too tiresome using the remote . The quality of the recordings even at 3 hour was great . I never tried to program the timer . The menu could have been better , but it was ok. You could n't delete chapters even on DVD-RWs , only the entire disk . The main problem was after 2 weeks , while watching it record a VHS , it seemed to pause . Turning off the VHS unit did n't help , hitting stop , etc . I had to turn off the recorder which made the almost full DVD-R useless . It worked after that , but I obviously do n't trust it anymore . I bought the GoVideo R6640 DVD Recorder after this one . I miss the cyberhome in comparison ! Least cyberhome worked GREAT over 20x . But should n't electronics work for at least a d**n year ? On an added note , it let me actually copy some copyrighted lecture videos that GoVideo & also Panasonic wo n't .	-1
I 've known and happily used SanDisk CF cards before , high quality , good price . This Ultra II card comes with some worries . Since CF does n't write at 9MB/sec , it uses a `` buffer '' to write a small amount ( like 4 megs ) to an ultra-fast buffer , then the image is slowly transferred to the main card . And there 's the problem.I lost every `` last image '' on my trip to Italy . When I powered on the camera , took say 5 pictures , it would record 4 and lose the last image . This is because I was turning the camera off after taking the 5th picture . I needed to leave the camera on another 20 seconds to be sure the memory card finished transfer of the images . So it 's very fast , for a small burst of pictures , but LEAVE THE CAMERA ON . I did a lot of `` that 's cool ! '' pictures ... you turn the camera on , take a picture , turn the camera off to save battery life . Mistake . Make sure you REVIEW the images ( and not just the temporary image displayed after the picture is taken ) before POWERING DOWN .	-1
I purchased this product for use with my new Sony Camcorder and it would n't work . Something about downloading certain kinds of files through it . Bla , bla , bla . It should work with EVERYTHING ! .	-1
I bought the Sony MDR-EX71SL a year ago and they worked great , but my son lost the ear buds . So I thought I would upgrade to the Shure or Etymotic . The Shure E2c was a mistake . The phones kept slipping out of my ear , there 's little bass , and poor sound isolation . I could try the Shure E3c , but that 's almost 5x more expensive than the Sony 's I had.I 'm going to order a new pair of the sony ex71sl . It had better sound isolation , stayed in my ear , were comfortable , and sounded good . Perhaps they boost the bass a little , but I 'm not a expert on this . The Sony just work better for me .	-1
I bought these over a year ago . I could n't be more disspointed with them . Although the midrange and higher sounds ok , it 's nothing to write home about . I did n't like the fact it has almost no bass . You wo n't get any bass if they are not sealed in your ear , so I tried all the pad sizes and still no bass . I do n't like how they stick out of your ear at all . I feel like I put the money through the paper shredder I shelled out for these .	-1
Not a comfortable earphone so it does n't matter how good it sounds . I ended up buying a pair of Bose earphones which sounds great and much more comfortable .	-1
I got Shure E2c sound isolating earphones primarily for use during flights . Although I have yet to test the sound isolation capability , I 'm really disappointed with its overall sound quality . I have been using Sony earphones which cost about a quarter of what I paid for these , and I must say Sony sounds a whole lot better than these Shure earphones .	-1
First of all , do n't take my word on this , follow up by going to broadbandreports.com and search on DWL-G810 . The security issue is that this device WILL NOT work unless you are broadcasting the SSID of your wireless network . This applies to the shipping firmware 2.0 and the newer firmware 2.12 . This is the deal killer for me since I do n't want to expose my network 's SSID . I 'm actually quite pissed off at DLINK over this.By contrast , DLINK 's & quot ; range extender & quot ; ( aka wireless repeater ) DWL-G800AP actually WORKS with SSID broadcast disabled , so one can see that DLINK could overcome this security issue.The remaining issues are these : ( 1 ) It wo n't support DHCP from your router to any PC hooked up to the bridge . You might think , hey , I 'll configure my PC for DHCP and it will get the IP info from the router through the bridge connection . Wrong ! It wo n't work . ( 2 ) The router itself does not work for obtaining DHCP from the router EVEN THOUGH IT HAS THIS AS AN OPTION . This is outrageous and completely unacceptable . Confirmed on BroadbandReports.com and by DLINK 's Level 2 support.Bottom line is that , while it works , it 's entirely manual in the configuration and the SSID broadcast requirement is a security vulnerability not worth enduring .	-1
The product is alright for what it costs , but I am really pissed by the packaging department . This item comes wrapped in brown paper instead of bubble wrap and at least 10 to 15 of the cases end up broken . I complained and the Amazon Customer Service people worked it out with me , but I STILL want for purchasers of this product to complain to customer service if you order this item and they come broken . That is the ONLY way something will be done about this Bad Wrapping .	-1
... which is n't really saying much , when you consider how pathetic the five hundred dollar Bose Wave radio is.People , it 's not rocket science : if you want quality sound you , miniaturizing and cramming together all your components into one tiny little box is NEVER going to do the trick -- -do n't fall for all the advertising snake oil about `` revolutionary technology , '' `` virtual surround sound , '' etc.At the very least a compact stereo system like the one hundred eighty dollar Sony CMTHPX9 has *detachable* speakers so you can get proper stereo separation and proper speaker placement . Or the Sony MHC-GX450 for an extra twenty dollars has a detachable subwoofer as well , not the ludicrous what , 3-inch subwoofer this Cambridge radio has ? Either of these would blow this thing clear out of the water ! Even better would be to browse jandr.com for something like a cheap receiver ( Sherwood 7108 , $ 130 ) , cheap CD/DVD player ( Toshiba 3960 , $ 50 ) , and speakers ( Polk R15s , $ 100/pair ) which would still cost less and would easily deliver five times better sound.Ah , form factor -- -yes that 's about the only thing that this Cambridge and that Bose Wave has going for it : I suppose if you live in a tiny five by ten foot closet ( a NYC apartment perhaps ? ) it might be useful to have something this small.Otherwise you are much better buying one of those compact stereos and a cheap clock radio for your bedside , which would probably cost you about half as much for far better sound quality !	-1
We got this camcorder shortly after it came out ( and paid a pretty penny for it ) . They hyped up the 3.0MP at the time which was n't suitable for decent photos even then . We never used the still photo capability so in retrospect we paid for some features we did n't need.Over the last 5 years it 's given us some great video memories ( I still need to get them off the tapes into a computer for permanent storage ) and I have no issues with the video quality . My primary gripe is that it has broken three times now . It gives an error code of E:61:10 and can no longer autofocus or zoom in/out . We 've had it repaired twice now , at over $ 200 a shot . So not only does it break , they make you pay such exorbitant repair fees . Now it 's broken for the third time after having just been repaired 14 months ago . It has reached the ridiculous stage . Three breakdowns in 5 years for the same problem.So while I 'm here shopping for a non-Sony camcorder ( planning on going back to Canon ) , I thought I 'd leave this review here for posterity .	-1
i 'm unhappy , not because there is anything wrong with this product , only because Amazon mislead me into buying this . Amazon made me believe that i needed to order this or something like it as they were showing it bundled with the hard drive i was purchasing . what they neglected to mention ANYWHERE was that the hard drive i ordered *came* with a cable ! So i paid nearly twice the price ( as this thing is overpriced ) for an item i didnt need in the first place . wonderful , thanks .	-1
It is right angle both ends ! ! and one of then brokes whe I tried to disconnect ! Wasted money and time !	-1
I contacted you regarding this order . You replied and I explained in simple terms what was wrong . Now I am requesting a full refund/credit since you have stopped contact . `` The cable 's right angle down end is not the same configuration that I needed as shown the picture you have on Amazon.com . Why ? Please advise . Why show the picture of a configuration and then ship the opposite ?	-1
Would not suggest this laptop , oblivious to the tech specs the laptop has no support for any non-xp OS . Sony plays the role of a Compaq-like scum bag and makes the drivers .exe-install only with the .ini 's associated compressed and encrypted . For 2000USD+ I wo n't play that game . This laptop gets the worst rating because it forces you to use the worse modern day OS ( XP-series . ) Sony needs to halt their continuing progression towards complete and utter crap . The new 04 ' laptops , do n't even come with recovery CDs , that 's right they cut that as well , making the laptop 15cents more profitable for Sony . Instead now because all 04 's come with CD burners installed , they require you to make your own Sony-proprietary recovery CDs ( 9 of them ) with CDs you have to buy ! ! ! ( I ca n't think of anything I would rather do right after I finish charging my dead new-from-factory battery then burning CDs for 90minutes ) Other complaints are the crappy hinges connecting the lcd to base , and the crappy archaic and obsolete speaker system ( Sony makes better sounding headphones from 5ft away . ) This is a real pitiful purchase ; excluding Trinitron monitors , headphones , and smart-shoot cameras I feel Sony 's future is extremely bleak , there other products fail to compete in price , they fail to offer even minimal product support , and they just barley run par to the competition 's specs . ( 03 's entry model has wireless lan , 04 's does n't - the only manufacture that has n't made wlan a barebones requirement ) The real kick in the ass is the gizmos no one will ever use on the laptop . Like a phone modem , the memory gate port , or even a smart card slot on an all inclusive 2000USD laptop ... All that waste and all I want to do is run Windows2k OR Linux.As one more side note Intel 's flagship chipset - Centrino , fails to support Linux natively as well . The only free solution is using ndiswrapper around the Centrino xp drivers . Hooray for two companies which I 'm quickly loosing respect for .	-1
I am foolish . I read all these horrible reviews about the product and thought & quot ; Maybe it wo n't happen to me , it wo n't break down , maybe it only happens to very few people & quot ; . I was wrong . I had the product for 98 days . It worked perfect and I loved it , it was the best electronic I had . I liked it more then my mp3 player , my car stereo , my digital camera . It could do so much and was useful , easy , and fun . But on the 98th day at school , I turned it on and all it showed was that Palm Logo . The screen light kept flickering then after 10 seconds did n't light up . It just stayed there . I tried turning it off , taking out the batteries , and everything , but none of that worked . Still showed that Palm Logo . I thought it would stop after a few hours , so when I got home I took it out and it was still like that . I tried to soft reset and hard reset . Nothing worked . So after a week , it was still like this . I did n't bother to waste my time to call Tech Support , and plus I hear they charge you money to call them after the warranty . Eventually the logo stopped showing and it was nothing . So I gave the support a try ... Palm refuses to do anything about it . Their forums were n't helping or their email or phone support . What a piece of junk . Well I sold it on eBay ( even though i said it did n't turn on ) and some stupid people still bought it for $ 75 . I used that money to buy a Dell Axim X30 , 312 MHZ Pocket PC . Same price , $ 199 and I have had it for 5 months and it still works perfectly . I have heard nothing bad about it . I traded that one up for one with Wi-Fi/Bluetooth intergrated and now its extremely functional . Until Palm gets their act together , go with the Pocket PCs . A little more expensive but better , more reliable , and more functions . I also plan on filing a lawsuit against Palm.THERE IS A REASON IT HAS A 90 DAY WARRANTY .	-1
When it was first introduced , the Palm Tungsten E was marketed as an affordable treasure trove of applications - Word , Excel , MP3 , Acrobat , photos , movies , etc . With a color display and a price tag under $ 200 , it seemed to have it all . It does delivery nicely on all of that promise . Unfortunately , Palm handicapped the E with one inexplicable design flaw that outweighs all of its upside - they somehow failed to include the ironically-named `` universal connector '' for recharging and syncing the unit . Instead , it comes with two separate jacks on its underside : one mini-USB for data sync and one AC adapter plug , leaving you faced with an unnecessary clutter of cords crossing your desk.In the beginning , I wanted to give the E every chance I could based on its functionality , and so I was lenient on this design oddity . Still , the inconvenience eventually made me hate using it . The plug design basically forces you into a choice between two very imperfect options - ( a ) threading the cords to the front of your desktop somehow so that you can have it right-side-up and still use it while plugged in , or ( b ) putting the cords behind the desk where they belong with the others and then suffering with an upside-down Palm . With option ( a ) , the relatively short cords and large jacks also put the unit at high risk of being knocked or dragged off of the desk . With option ( b ) , even syncing became a chore - the lack of a cradle button to trigger a sync means that you have to power up the unit and kick it off via on-screen icons , all while looking at it upside-down or else yanking a bunch of messy excess cord onto your desk.Still , I wanted to make the most of the E 's robust bundle of applications , and for its low price , I knew not to expect that everything would come standard in the box . So I went shopping for a proper charging cradle , only to find that no such accessory for the E exists . In fact , Palm does n't even sell replacements for its individual sync/charging cables at all . So , aside from all routine inconvenience while using it , this model also comes with the incredible risk that if either cord is every lost or damaged , you become the proud owner of a sleek-looking $ 200 paperweight . It 's possible by now that some third-party company has begun creating unlicensed cords that claim to be compatible , but that 's hardly comforting in the face of Palm 's obvious lack of support for its own product line.And given the weak battery that the E is equipped with ( and it ca n't be upgraded ) , you 'll have it connected to the charging cord quite a bit . When I was using it religiously every workday , I needed to recharge it each night . What a disappointment this setup is compared to , for example , the Tungsten T3 - it uses the universal connector to dock with a cradle that continuously charges it and syncs it on command while keeping it at an ideal ergonomic angle for use/reference while sitting on your desktop . And since its using the universal connector , you 're able to accessorize it further , i.e . buy a separate docking cradle for the office , a charger for the road , etc . The T3 setup makes perfect sense , the E setup is shamefully inadequate - it 's as if Palm wants E owners to never forget that they purchased `` the cheap one '' .In conclusion , its advertised plusses are very real , but go for the Tungsten E at your own risk . Its greatest failure is that there is no obvious reason why it could n't have lived up to its potential as the ultimate PDA . The more you live with its one Achilles ' Heel , the more you 'll wish you 'd spent a little extra on the T3.PROSVersatility and quality of applications that it runs ( MS Office , Acrobat , MP3 , photos , movies , etc . ) Brilliant color displayCONSLack of universal connector makes everyday use/charging/syncing more and more irritatingLack of Palm support for the E , as in no replacement cords available , makes it a risky option	-1
When I first got this keyboard , I was very pleased . Functionally , I could tell no difference between using this keyboard and a wired one . However , after I used the keyboard for a couple of days , it suddenly stopped connecting to the Mac . I went into the Bluetooth preferences to work with the pairings , and nothing that I did re-established the connection -- every time I tried it , I got an & quot ; authentication failed & quot ; error.I followed all installation instructions , including upgrading the Bluetooth firmware before installing the keyboard . I also followed all standard troubleshooting procedures . The keyboard simply stopped working and refused to start again . I would assume that this is an unusual occurrence , based on so many other people being so much more enthusiastic about the keyboard , but for my own part , this keyboard goes back to Amazon , and I 'm sticking with USB for the foreseeable future . Based on my experiences with this keyboard , and my similarly dismal experiences with the Apple Wireless Mouse , it does not appear to me that Bluetooth input devices are & quot ; ready for prime time & quot ; .	-1
Well out of the two Orbits I bought , one last for about a month working perfectly , then it quit panning . The second I bought to see if it was a fluke did n't work right out of the box . I think this product is a little to complicated for what ever 3rd world country is assembling them . I say save your money and pass on this one .	-1
windows error claimed that this cameras logo wasnt certified by microsoft so to procede with install would jepordize system stability . then it kept asking for a driver that i had installed . so bottom line is it never would work . i tried it on an intel and amd machine both late models with win xp and niether worked . this is the second logitech camera i have had similar problems with and will probably not buy from them again .	-1
Pro : Has that Porsche name on it.Con : Big deal - still looks rather unimpressive.Suggested use : backup ? ? Actual use : how could anyone use this hard drive for back up when it 's so unreliable ! And slow , even under the best of times ! Drive died after 2 years of infrequent use ( only when I 'm editing my home movies ) or backing up my documents . While a recovery was possible , that kind of defeats the purpose of 'backup , ' does n't it ? Second : slow . Often , it took about 10-15 minutes to move a 1 GB file ( about twice what it took on another portable HD I 've used ) .Conclusion : Avoid .	-1

Are too bulky . Sound quality is good . Has inline volume and mute but never use it . RCA/analog jacks . Have n't used the microphone so ca n't comment on that . I would not re-purchase . I think there are better alternatives . I was happier with my previous Plantronics , which was much lighter and sounded just as good but the cheap foam covers on the ear pieces wore out and no replacements at the time .	-1
I bought THREE of these things over the last two years ... at least two of them from Amazon . ( The actual model number was different -- XVC20U in black -- but it 's basically the same combo deck they 've been selling for several years now . Now they 've added progressive scan and DVD burner , other than that it looks like the exact same thing that I bought . ) They worked fine at first , but after a while , DVDs started freezing up on them . Oddly , I have absolutely NO trouble playing music CDs in the very same drives.DVD freezing has happens on ALL THREE of them , but it is worse on the unit I have used most . It seems to do it less when the machine or the DVD has cooled down . It gets worse over time . Lens cleaning with a disc-brusher , lens cleaning via taking off the case for direct contact cleaning , and air-pressured dusting -- all do no good.Anyway , thanks to JVC I have several hundred dollars worth of DVD players that do n't play DVDs ... other reviews ( under various model numbers ) suggest there 's not a chance JVC will make good on them.I have had , in the past , good luck with JVC TVs and car stereo units , and I try to stay loyal to brands , suppliers and what not . But I seriously doubt I will be making any other JVC purchases due to these things . I suppose JVC does n't place much value on their brand or image or they would n't have dumped this stuff into the marketplace.It seems to be getting harder and harder to find companies that bother to make products that are actually worth what you pay for them . I suppose companies that rip-off customers and laugh their way to the bank must be part of the `` new economy '' I keep hearing about .	-1
Have had 2 of these and they eventually fail and not power up anymore.Granted we used these for work in a busy environment.But they are just a piece of hardware with no moving parts.Just not reliable enough ! ! !	-1
After calling in a ( computer knowledgable ) friend to help me install this print server ; and spending 6 hours trying to install the Linksys PSUS4 , we gave up and called Linksys Service . This unit got two stars for the polite and hard work the service person gave to this situation . After one hour with Mark at Linksys , we were told that this PSUS4 WILL NOT WORK WITH ANY MULTI FUNCTION PRINTER . Linksys gets zero stars for not printing this info on their box , installation papers , or the enclosed CD . Linksys knows this will not work on most multi function printers , the most common today , but will not tell their potential customers . Save yourself a lot of time and DO NOT do what I did , ordered this for a Multi funtion printer . You owe me a beer for this .	-1
Linksys has a quality reputation , which is why I bought this product while ignoring it 's bad reviews . However , this product does nothing besides serve as a 10/100 network hub . The USB print function does n't work . Do n't waste your money , or time trying uselessly to get it to work.Tech support folks did n't speak English . They ca n't help , either .	-1
I 've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently . I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card . But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot , the camcorder worked . Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card . The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update : Over 3 weeks and I 'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update : Finally got the warranty replacement . Everything seems to be working now . I would now rate this about 3 stars .	-1
This expensive cable stopped working after four years , likely while it was being plugged or unplugged . It looked like a high-quality cable , but I ca n't endorse it .	-1
I bought this unit to replace 2 Sony 200 cd only disc players . This model was only $ 125 more than the 400 cd player , so i went with it . The menu funtions are terrible ! ! ! ! They are way over complicated and irritating . And if you just wan na play cd 's you have to enter th cd # and then wait for the player to recognize the cd before you can select a track . It is a time consuming annoyance . If you want to use the shuffle or program features you have to use the menu on you TV . You ca n't just push a button and go . This player is a huge disapointment , but i 'm too lazy to remove all my cd 's and take it back .	-1
Originally posted January 21,2005I 've had the product for about 10 months . Sound and picture quality are fine but using the damn thing distroys much of its value . The ease-of-use issues have been well documented by other disappointed users so I will only say the issues they raised are right on . Hard to use is an understatement . My review is to share my experience with a failure mode and Sony repair . I have a lot of CDs and DVDs but am not a heavy user . Maybe watch a move once a week and play a few CDs now and then . Noticed some of the DVDs were making noise and not playing properly . Discovered fairly deep circular gouges that made several disks unplayable . At first , though they were damaged at purchase but then realized perfect DVDs were being distroyed . Appeared to be only disks around 350 that were damaged and probably when I used the auto LOAD function to read disk titles . May not be the cause but it is always after this operation that damaged disks have been discovered . Would like to know if anyone else has had this problem . Now for Sony service . After making it through the voice recognition phone menu system and providing name address phone model etc I was finaly placed in Q for a live agent -- 45 minutes later I was connected to a very nice woman who arranged for an exchange , not new , but a refurbished product . That 's OK with me , a refurbished product is probably just as good as new . The rub is that it cost me over $ 40 to return ship the product to Sony . They provide a work order that you take to a `` UPS Store '' but you pay for shipping and handling . And then wait for Sony to send the replacement . I just returned mine last week so do n't know how long the process will take . I do know that good customer care will ship you a new or refurbished product and have you use that packaging to return the original product . The best companies even pay for shipping , all shipping . If I get the refurbished unit back within two weeks and if it looks and works like new , I probably will be satisfied but Sony could , and should , have done better both in the design of the product and in its customer care. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -I 'm Back ! It took about four weeks for repair . So far so good . Seems to work like new , but too soon to know if the disks are now safe . If the problem returns , I 'll let you know !	-1
I originally wrote a positive review about the card , but perhaps a little too soon . I 've had this less than a week and hardly used it ... .and now it 's dead . Camera says `` unable to use , '' and my PC does n't recognize it anymore . I just read several negative reviews for the Ultra II Compact Flash version , so I 'm not surprised the SD cards are duds too . Returning mine for refund .	-1
I have to agree with most reviews that overall this is a good camera . But it is good only when it is working . 5060 ( and I can speculate 7070 too ) might experience what has become known as `` FAULTY DIAL SWITCH '' problem . If you search the web for those terms associated with `` olympus '' - you will most likely find a lot of disturbing complaints.Mine broke couple of months after the warranty expired , right before we were about to take a family vacation . When I turned on the camera - it did not respond to any buttons . Then , it started activating menues all by itself as if the camera was trying to catch up with the previously pushed buttons . In effect camera became inoperational.Sent it to Olympus . Got a letter back asking for [ ... ] in repair costs . Called Olympus customer service . Was told that they charge flat fee regardless of the problem . Told them that this is ridiculous , its a wide-spread problem and Olympus should stand behind their product . Car-manufacturers normally issue recalls or extend warranty for such problems . 5060 is not worth [ ... ] I paid for it [ ... ] a year and a half later . Rep. went to speak with a manager and came back saying that `` Ah ! If it is only the switch problem - then will charge you [ ... ] '' . Apparently they did not even look at the camera before sending me the [ ... ] bill.Needless to say the whole process took about a month . Spent vacation with my 5 year old Canon Digital Elph.If you insist on buying Olympus - just be aware of the problem and that it is random and frequent and that Olympus does not handle it well . One thing I am sure about - my next camera is not going to be made by Olympus .	-1
It seems facial hair has to be a bit long for this to actually work.So if you bought it for facial areas , maybe look for something else .	-1
I admit to being suspicious of this device . Why else would people start out saying things like , `` It did n't hurt that much '' ? YES , IT DID.Before I put this anywhere near my tender skin , I looked around for a guinea p -- I mean , my husband . I tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand . He did n't flinch . The man is a rock.If I had known better , I would have tried it out on my brother , the Marine . He would have jumped up and down for me . In fact , I may try it out on him later , just for fun.Anyway , picture this . Use a tweezer to pluck out one hair at a time from your forearm . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again . Then do it again.Rinse and repeat .	-1
I own the Braun Silk-epil Expressive Epilator and I 'm happy with it . But , I wanted a small one for more delicate areas ( i.e . under arms & bikini ) . Unfortunately , this one did n't remove a thing . The tweezer head is curved ( vs. straight across ) and unless you have long hairs to pluck , this wo n't do a thing for you . I 'm familiar with epilating and tried every which way to get it to work , but to no avail . I printed out my return label & I 'm heading to the post office today .	-1
This case provided good if inconvenient protection - at first . You had to take the Palm out of the case to synch or charge it , both occasions when I 'm likely to drop the device and so especially need it in the case . But it was sturdy , slim , and fairly light weight.Then , after using it for about six weeks , it quit latching shut . No amount of fooling around with it will get it to stay closed . I recommend against this case and suggest you purchase one with a more secure closing mechanism .	-1
The surface of the case is alarmingly slippery.The expansion card & quot ; holders & quot ; do not hold . Theextra expansion card I had just purchased isgone ; slipped out of the & quot ; holder & quot ; . ka-ching ! More money down the drain . Now , after a whoppingthree weeks of use , the case does not clickshut at all.The only good thing about this case is that itis still protecting my Tungsten E somewhat.As soon as I find a decent case elsewhere , it'sgoing in the trash .	-1
I had to do a large burn of over 100 disks for work . PowerPoint and Publications.In this 100 disk pack that came today , only 24 disks out of the 100 were burnable ; the other 76 were not.I used 3 burners for my project ... no one burner had a disproportional rejected burns . One burner was on a different computer . Two were on the same computer.When a disk was rejected , I tried it on another drive ... .never did another drive accept a rejected disk.I have always used Maxell ; years ago for cassettes , then VHS and now disks . I have NEVER had this trouble before and I do a lot of burning.Hopefully this is not a trend for Maxell . But I ca n't afford the time or the money to find out.Very frustrating .	-1
1 . Product does not work with any firewall.2 . Windoes XP crashed.3 . Only 802.11b4 . No streaming audio at all.This product is not ready for prime time.I am returning it today !	-1
I tried this with my stereo and various radios . It worked marginally at best , but most of the time it did n't work at all . My stereo is digital , most of my radios are dial : did n't matter . I could n't get it to perform consistantly at all . When it did work it had to be within a few feet of the receiver , but sound was still full of static and easily interupted . I had more luck with the Tunecast , which is n't saying much . I tried all the ideas and suggestions to improve performance with negligible improvement . I 'm returning this piece of junk today , I feel like a sucker for buying it .	-1
This is my third JBL subwoofer . JBL offered me the E250P after my second PB12 stopped working and could not be fixed ! The first PB12 I had stopped working within a month , so Best Buy was willing to let me exchange it for another PB12 . I thought that my first one was just a fluke . So , against my better judgement I went ahead and exchanged it instead of getting a refund . With the second PB12 the warranty had just expired when it finally failed . I took it to a repair shop to get it fixed and they told me it could not be fixed because the part that failed had failed so often in these things that the supply had been completely exhausted . So the parts needed to fix it were no longer available ! It was a huge disaster ! I contacted JBL and they were aware of the problem and offered to sell me a new E250P at a reduced price of $ 185 . Like a fool I thought I 'd give them another chance . I look back at it know and ca n't believe I made that choice . But it was either shell out another $ 300+ for another brand subwoofer or pay the $ 185 . And now , the E250P is starting to fail as well . Stay far far away from this garbage and any other JBL product . This company seems to be totally clue-less .	-1
I bought one of these due to the great discounts many dealers have on them , but was sadly disappointed . I suppose for two hundred dollars I should not have expected much.Boomy , muddy , slow -- -this thing was a complete disaster . For movies it 's somewhat okay but for music it was so bad that I just turned the darn thing off and made do with my little bookshelf speakers that only go down to 70Hz . Quickly sent it back and forked out an extra two hundred for a Hsu sub and now I could n't be happier .	-1
Contrary to the product information on this item 's listing on Amazon , it is NOT compatible with the Nano 2G . It has male connector hardware for which there is no corresponding female receptacle on the Nano . Also the product packaging does not indicate that this device can be used with the NANO.I am not the first here to notice this . My bad for not reading the reviews before buying . Shame on Amazon for not correcting this misleading listing and shame on Belkin for providing Amazon with misleading specifications .	-1
I have had this for over a year so I can do a review not based on ignorance of knowing how to use the product . It is a great concept in that you only need one gateway for both cable access and wireless internet access . It does connect quickly and easily . However in just doing web browsing it will require hard reboots several times a day from dropped signals . I now have my main computer connected through an ethernet cable to avoid having to reboot several times per day . The laptop I use is a chore since it will drop the signal so often . I have worked on linksys site and have all the settings optimized so it is using a channel and frequency that no other items use . Unfortunately it still drops the signal several times a day . Internet Explorer , Firefox apparently is too much on the router and it drops several times per hour . I have to use a no name browser where it is very limited so it does n't overload the wireless router so I can sometimes get an hour in without it going down . I highly do not recommend this product . The convenience of all in one is not worth the more inconvenience of browsing then losing connection and having to go back to the router and turn off/on several times a day .	-1
This cable gateway is supplied by RCN . It replaced a Motorola cable modem and my own D-Link Wireless router.First , it is missing a key feature , port translation . With port translation , a server on your network ( such as an ethernet webcam ) can be set to its default port 80 , which is translated inside the router to a different port , such as 5080 . It 's a feature existing in any reputable router , but missing from this one.Second , the wireless system has serious problems . Signal strength is much lower than my D-Link despite a physically larger antenna . I ca n't reliably reach my laptop in the kitchen . No matter my location , the connection drops ( glitches ) frequently , and drops VPN connections . Sometimes it actually refuses to reconnect until I cycle power on or disable and re-enable the PCMCIA wireless card.I 'm going to try to get RCN to switch me to a Motorola modem , but I 'll buy my own if I have to to get rid of this Linksys piece of junk and go back to my own D-Link . I ca n't believe Cisco dares to put their brand name on such lousy equipment .	-1
Bottom line : it works for an unknown amount of time , after which you will continually have to restart the unit any time you send too much data at once . Skype calls , more than 1 computer , Xbox Live , all of it . Kind of makes this gateway/router useless after a period of time . Try a different model .	-1
Someone gave me a cheap pair of noise canceling headphones from Radio Shack , and I figured I could do better , so I bought these JVC headphones . The retractable cord was a big selling point , and I do like that feature a lot , although it 's very hard to find the switch when you 're ready to retract the cord . I also wanted smaller earphones , and several people mentioned these were good for smaller ears ( which mine are ) . I found these to be very uncomfortable . They 're bigger and clunkier than the Radio Shack headset I have , and they 're really tight . They really pin my outer ear down -- I could n't find a way to adjust them that made them feel any better . The noise reduction feature does work pretty well . No complaints about that . I played a DVD on the plane and could hear even the softest dialogue just fine ( with the volume turned all the way up ) . However , they 're not significantly better than my cheaper headphones in that regard . Because of the discomfort and overall `` clunkiness , '' I 'm returning these headphones .	-1
I got these phones for use in commercial airplanes and they are a major disappointment . There is a minimal reduction in background noise , but some of this noise is replaced with a hiss . iPod music is barely audible unless turned up to levels that make me fear for my hearing , which is the purpose of the headphones in the first place . In more quiet environments , the hiss is still quite noticable , but the sound is not too bad . In summary , they are n't much better than regular open headphones .	-1
I got this headset to use when I mow the lawn so I could listen to music with my IPod Nano . The music sounds pretty good until I start the mower blades and then I do n't hear anything . It does cut down the sound of the mower but it also seems to cut the volume level of the ear phones . I ca n't hear anything . So much for listening to music while I mow .	-1
I bought this system as part of a Dell XPS 4 gaming system . It was the best option they offered in the speaker department and after reading the reviews on Amazon and other sites seemed like a reasonable choice . My reaction from day one was , `` that 's it ? '' The sound is tinny , marginal at best and certainly not worth the price . It 's almost painful listening to mp3 's and radio on them . The construction is cheap and plasticy . The speakers have no directional adjustments like angle or tilt at all to direct the sound . I was traveling during much of the 30 return window but just assumed that when I had the time to tinker with them I could tweak the sound to be full bodied and even . Unfortunately that did n't happen . I 'm considering selling them on e-bay . Do n't waste your money . Even Dell has switched to Logitech on their XPS system offering .	-1
Have the original ProMedia speakers , but research shows that my comments are relevant to the Ultra version.These are without a doubt the best speakers I have heard for the intended use ( small room HT or PC music/movies ) and price ... Crisp , clear , sparkling highs , clear , tight , unmuddied bass ... truly spectacular ... . until they fail.The power supply is under-designed , and fails at a very high rate . More aggravating , Klipsch refuses to repair/upgrade the production components , and charges $ 90 to replace known failure prone components WITH THE SAME PART NUMBERS ! A couple of years ago , I located a repairman ( in Texas IIRC ) who did an upgrade of the subject parts in the power supply , and have had no problems after the upgrade ... Do not recall his name or address , but since this is a well documented problem , I suspect any qualified electronics shop could do the same thing for about what Klipsch charges for reinstalling the same failing parts .	-1
This scope has too many deficiencies to even mention in detail : it is too small a light gathering instrument , and has an inexpensive ( poor ) mount that vibrates excessively when touched . Consider instead something that has more light gathering power ( a larger diameter lens ) , and a scope that comes with a sturdy adjustable mount . This scope will perhaps show the brighter objects to advantage , such as the moon , but dimmer objects need more light , and this scope is just too small . The mount needs to be sturdy and adjustable ( look for an equatorial mount with touch-turn controls ) . If the mount is shaky and vibrates excessively when touched , it spoils your view of the object.This scope and mount , less than 50 dollars , can not be considered anything more than a toy . If you really want to get a starter scope , do n't look here . Consider a greater investment in a more quality instrument . Even if the budding astronomer loses interest , the scope , if it is of quality design , will have a greater resale value , or will make a nice gift to someone else.Having witnessed this scope in action , my advice is to avoid it , unless you are just buying an expensive toy . It is not a serious entry-level instrument.konedog	-1
This product worked about 3 weeks . Green lite quit functioning almost immediately and sometimes the batteries never get charged or else charger not working at all anymore.Do n't waste your money on this one ! ! ! ! Spend a little more and try Duracell or another brand .	-1
What Amazon.com sends you is the `` Compact '' Energizer Charger and not the `` Overnight '' Charger pictured here . The Compact charger charges AA batteries in 4 hours @ 720 MAH while the overnight charges them in 8 hours @ 300 MAH . Longer charging time is better for your rechargable batteries as they will last longer this way . I returned mine .	-1
I am actually using diNovo keyboard to type this review , and it is a bit of a struggle due to malfunctioning spacebar . : ( I did a bit of research on diNovo before buying it . Most online magazines ( PCMag , CNet , etc . ) highly recommend this product , noting its high price as the only drawback.I got this keyboard/mouse combo a week ago , and I must say it looks and feels great . Separate keyboard and touchpad save you desk space . Mouse runs all day without a need for recharging.I did n't experience any connection issues . It was only one time that I had to press the `` connect '' buttons on BlueTooth hub and mouse to have it re-detected because it stopped functioning all of the sudden.The initial installation was smooth . I downloaded the latest drivers , got everything connected and everything went well from there ... until yesterday.All of the sudden the space bar ( probably the most useable key on any keyboard ) started losing response . I had to hit it harder to move the cursor and even then , at times , it would not respond . As I type this , I often have to hit the spacebar 4-5 times in order to make a single space between the words.Another problem surfaced early this morning . The lower `` fast scroll '' mouse button would sometimes result in a `` locked '' fast scroll . This could be a software issue , I am not sure.One thing is for certain , the assembly quality seems to be on the lower side . I reached this conclusion based not only on personal experience , but by reading other customer reviews and comments . Given the high price of this product , I am extremely disappointed , if not angry . This is probably the most expensive keyboard/mouse combo on the market , and one thing Logitech should have made sure is that it is of solid build quality . The product is produced by a Logitech plant in China , by the way . ***Update***I have now received the replacement diNovo mouse/keyboard , and it 's been working fine for 2 months now . The only complaint I have is that F6 , F7 , F8 keys are REAL stiff and hard to press.Again , build quality is highly disappointing considering high product price.On the bright side , I was pleased with Logitech support . They are easy to reach at toll-free number with virtually no waiting times . The replacement product was sent to me in timely manner .	-1
I got this so that I could listen to music with others on car rides , and it worked great for the first month . After that , a wire must have broken because one side of them stopped working .	-1
iPod `` Touch '' ( nor my son 's iPhone 3GS ) . Item description as shown does not say this , but the packaging clearly says `` For : iPod 3G , 4G , 5G , mini , shuffle '' . Also , a little slip of paper is enclosed ( mostly in Chinese ) that has a line for the `` Metal of connector '' that has six columns following , each with a heading of a different metal ... and under the heading of `` Pb '' ( which is LEAD ! ) there is an `` X '' in this column ; below this line is a legend that says `` X : Indicate hazardous substance concentration higher than MCV '' . I guess Caveat Emptor applies .	-1
Thank god for XBMC , I dumped my prismiq device years ago , it was a pioneering product , but with not so great support . The company was trying to bite off more than it could chew and could not make the box work as described.The company was very helpful in giving me a refund for the purchase price , so I think they were very honest and that is not very common in today 's cut-throat world . That is why I gave them 2 stars.Goodbye PRISMIQ , it was great using your product as I learned about watching personal videos on my TV ! Kudos for being at the forefront of the tech wave.Hello XBMC ! F .	-1
Setting up the WiFi with this product is close to an impossible task . I see that it obviously works for other people , therefore the raving reviews . I bought the Prismiq Media Player after doing a lot of research , and based on the opinion of other users I thought it would be the best `` Digital Audio Receiver '' to buy . I was dead wrong . I started by buying the recommended cards - with their routers , just to find out that Prismiq did not support certain versions of the cards - actually , some of the versions that they support are no longer available ! After sending the card and router back , I got yet another card / router combination - again from their recommended list , just to find out that the Media Player does not recognize this card either ! What I have is $ 200.00+ paper weight sitting in my living room ! To add insult to injury - Prismiq 's `` customer service '' support is non-existing . Just try calling their toll free number - you 'll be placed on hold , just to be forwarded to an answering machine - and of course , they will not return calls . I sent them an e-mail explaining my problem , and I have yet to receive an answer.I 'm thinking of going with the Creative 's Sound Blaster Wireless Music system . I wish I had done so from the beginning.I emphatically do not recommend this player to anyone .	-1
So i bought a Lexar and an Esecure All in 1 mini card reader . Today i received both and put them to the test.TESTTransfer 4 mov files that total 877mb . Here are the results.CF Card used Transcend 600xLexar ( FIREWIRE 400 ) test 1 = 00:00'58 '' 3test 2 = 00:00'58 '' 4test 3 = 00:00'58 '' 3Esecure ( USB 2.0 ) test 1 = 00:00'27 '' 1test 2 = 00:00'34 '' 2test 3 = 00:00'26 '' 1I was a little disappointed that the Lexar took longer because i expected it to be faster.Lexar - CF cards ONLYEsecure - 150 different cardsLexar - Expensive ( approx $ 45 ) Esecure - Cheap ( approx $ 10 ) The size of the Esecure is smaller than the Lexar.WINNER ESECURE ALL in 1 by far . Recommended by me.I 'll update review if things change as far as malfunctions and durability.http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CKC8W8/ref=oh_details_o06_s02_i00Hope this review was helpful .	-1
I bought the Lexar reader from a Lexar dealer and when it arrived it was defective . I sent it to Lexar for a replacement and they sent me another defective reader . I phoned and spoke with someone in tech support and they said that they no longer had new units to send out , only ones that customers had returned .	-1
YAMAHA ( it 's a japanese company ) makes many products , for example , ICs , pianos , keyboards , audio products.The YAMAHA 's best audio product is NS-1000M , a book-shelf speaker.NS-1000M is the best speaker made in Japan in the history.Unfortunately , NS-1000M is not sold now.And more unfortunately , YAMAHA now has become a trivial maker.NS-333 is only one of low cost speakers . orz	-1
This is a piece of junk cable . The description says dual link DVI cable . It is clearly a single link cable . The actual cable is so thin . Almost like an audio cable . Shipping took like 2 weeks . Even though I live in Las Vegas and the seller claims to be shipping from California . It should only take 3-4 days max . Even with slow post shipping . Total piece of crap . Waste of money . Do n't buy .	-1
Have yet to actually see this work yet . I have had issues with the computer I bought this for , so it has n't worked yet . I installed it on my new computer , and it `` shows '' that it 's working , but no through-put yet . Reinstalled the old D-link 10/100 and it works fine . Have not had a lot of time to work it through yet , but I 'm sure it will . Troubleshooting guide on the disk will most definitely help much more than the `` online help menu '' , since this gadget really needs to be working to get you to the `` online help menu to start with .	-1
This is very nice and handy but I will list my pros and cons.Pros : SmallCompactComes with a case and lens clothVery easy and comfortable to hold and focusCons : Very poor eye relief ( you have to take all glasses off ) Poor quality control as this arrived factory damaged ( lens has spots inside ) I will replace this and hope that this next one comes with a better lens . I can take my glasses off with no problem.I have to give this one a 1 star and will update if the next arrives with a better lens as this one is unusable . I would only buy this if you have Prime so you can return it for no additional charge . I like the one handed focus idea . I have asked for a replacement , and I hope this helps someone.Update 3-22-14 : The replacement was free and fast . It came with no obvious lens damage . The eye relief is still 0 and I must take my glasses off . The rubber eye-piece arrived distorted . I still have issues with quality control so I 'll keep this at 1 star . On a very positive note this is small and lightweight and the easiest to focus ( though this one has limited focus ability ) ; one only needs one hand . Again , I would only buy this having prime . It seems like a good American business went with Chinese quality and it has adversly affected this company .	-1
These drives look great , but they have MAJOR operational issues . They are amply described in just about all the review areas for the LaCie drives that Amazon sells . In short , these drives die . Often . Mine started smoking one day , just after the warranty ran out.If you buy this drive , or any LaCie drive , there is something you NEED to know : LACIE DOES NOT SERVICE OUT-OF-WARRANTY DRIVES ! ! ! That 's right , LACIE DOES NOT SERVICE OUT-OF-WARRANTY DRIVES ! ! ! If the actual hard disk inside your unit goes bad after the warranty , it 's understandable that LaCie may not want to fix it.But if a switch , connector , or , in my case , internal power supply goes bad , LACIE WILL NOT FIX YOUR DRIVE OR SELL YOU THE PART- So I was forced to buy ANOTHER LaCie drive with the same Oxford Chipset to recover my data . AAAARGGGHHH . And they are not even nice about it- the LaCie tech basically laughed at me when I called , and told me the data on the drives was guaranteed to be gone . This turned out not to be true , I got all my data back by putting the disks in a new enclosure . Then , I threw both enclosures away.I am SO done with this company . I have been getting new drives from Other World Computing , they are of similar cost and design , but the company will perform post-warranty service .	-1
Works well BUT the top is not so easy to use . It is a struggle each time to pop it open . The band is too tight and it takes both hands and strong fingers to unlock it . There are lots of other drives that works as well without the problem .	-1
I had one of these and it began shorting within six months . Still usuable if you fiddle with it and set it just right , but not suitable for serious work where having your presentation go all green , for example , would be a disaster . But there are n't many alternatives . I may use the mini-dvi to dvi adapter with a vga-dvi adapter . Clumsy , but would probably work .	-1
This mini tripod is a pretty good basic design , but to work in practice I had to cut a couple of inches off the center post and swap out the head for a decent ball head . The plastic pan head is simply not strong enough to hold anything but a point and shoot . Certainly not a D800 . The head 's main problem is the plastic hinge that allows the camera to be rotated into vertical . It 's supposed to be an additional feature but makes the head so `` floppy '' that at best you can only shoot static shots : forget panning or tilting during a video take . It 's also very difficult to level the horizon . That hinge again . It simply ca n't be tightened enough to hold the camera level.The suction cup on the center post is supposed to attach to a flat surface , but the surface has to be perfect to work . Not likely . The cup deteriorated after a couple of years , too , becoming superfluous . Worse , with the legs retracted to their shortest ( and most stable ) position the center post has to be extended upwards . Now the camera is really top heavy and , again , the whole thing is unstable.I speak from trying to shoot video clips in Washington DC , where you are n't allowed to use a full-sized tripod . So I carried this little guy , setting it on domed trash receptacles or benches . Those domes together with That excessively long center post made it almost impossible to use . It was n't up to the job . I came home and shortened the center post , removed the pan head and replaced it with a sturdy ball head . Still ca n't really pan , but can at least level the horizon.I 'd recommend a different setup . After I got done cutting the center post and adding aGiottos MH1302-655 Professional Calibrated Ball Head with MH 655 Quick ReleaseI should have gotten theSUNPAK MINI-PROPLUS/B Mini Tripod with Compact Ballhead .	-1
Is not much to say about an adapter but after I received it it did n't work , one of the moving parts that extend the tape did not worked properly and got stuck and did n't allow the VHS-C cassette to be inserted properly.Instead of return the item , I decided to open the adapter and try to see where the moving part got stuck and it was in fact a defective plastic in the mechanism that prevented the moving piece to fully move . After removing that defective piece the adapter worked like charm and now I can see again my old home videos.I give it 2 stars because it should worked in the first place with no further fixes like mine .	-1
I am not sure why I bought this without looking at the reviews first ! Wow ! This does not fit my darn VHS player , but every other VHS adapter I have does fit !	-1
Well , I bought this product taking in account reviews made by customers . A lot of people says it 's a good product , but my experience it 's completely different . Basically the charger is a timed charger and does not detect batteries been fully charged . I have used this charger for over a year . At the beginning I thought I was doing it wrong . Batteries very hot after `` charging '' and charge does not last any longer than a month . I use the batteries for mouse and keyboard . I have an energizer charger with charge indicator and it 's working just fine batteries charged in it last for months and no problem at all . Does not charge batteries as it 's supposed to do.I do n't recommend this product , it 's really bad .	-1
I 'm forever looking for a good pair of headphones for running . Primarily my previous ones have failed for one of two reasons , either the bouncing from running makes them fall out of my ears , or sweat gets into them and they cut out . I had high hopes for these Panasonics because it looked like the over-the-ear design would resist falling out . Well , they do n't fall out . But , after about 3 miles I am overcome with the pinching pain from the way they sit on my ears that I pull them out . The sound quality was fair to good and they never overloaded with sweat , but that 's because the speaker sits away from the ear , not inside it . Other reviewers have said the same thing I have , they 're good phones but if you have ears of an ogre , skip'em .	-1
Perhaps it 's defective but the zipper was hard to open/close . This bag may be all weather with its bells and whistles but it slows me down for taking pictures due to its zipper . I sent it back and I 'm still looking for a decent bag for my LX-7 .	-1
I tested this with my HX9V and LX7 . It squeezes the LX7 and it gets even worse if you try to fit the battery charger . In case of the HX9V , there 's enough room to fit the camera , but it gets ugly and bulky if you try to fit the battery charger . Also , there 's an useless velcro to close the front accessory pocket that makes if even uglier.The best case for LX-7 is the Case Logic TBC-304 . It 's not too big and you can fit the LX-7 , spare SD card , communication cable , spare battery and the battery charger that goes in the front pocket.Case Logic TBC-304 Compact Camcorder/High Zoom Camera Case ( Black ) For smaller compacts , I think this case would work pretty well .	-1
First of all , in my country are many dead Dual radios , I do n't know where is made in ! ! This model is Discontinued by the Factory in their website ! BEWARE OF THAT ! ! Im very surprise for 5 Stars Reviews ! That 's Why is very Cheap ! ! Go For the Clarion , JVC , SONY Pioneer .	-1
Worked great and loved it for about 6 months and while out of town on a work trip it started opening and closing non stop while driving . After 2 days of this I pulled the fuse and bought one at a store the following day , with driving over 250 miles a day between several appointnents for a month long trio and the radio being what keeps me awake it needed to be fixed with something more dependable . T he features of this product worked great and sound quality was good for a cheap head unit and if you want something for a temporary fix or any short term use it would be great for that but if it is sonething you plan on keeping for any length of tome you may want to consider something that is built to last .	-1
I had a bad feeling when this unit arrived . Worked ok for a while then after about 9 months various buttons started malfunctioning . Very cheap parts . the most cheap feeling stereo I have ever purchased . I wish I went with my gut and returned this piece of garbage in the beginning . I have since bought a pioneer deh 4300 and it works great . If you have an ipod the pioneer 4300 works great with it . I have an ipod touch . I wish I went with the pioneer in the beginning instead this unit . I wanted hd radio . It works alright but I live in orange county just south of L.A . It cuts out enough to be annoying . Factor that in with the extremely cheap radio its housed in and one year later its done . Not surprising it broke so fast when you see how cheap this thing is made . As far as hd radio goes when its not cutting out it sounds great . I think I will wait until they get hd radio working better before I go this route again . Dual should be ashamed of making radios this bad .	-1
Like many others , I purchased this for use in my Sony PSP . I loaded it up with some MP3 's before getting on an 8 hour flight and it worked great . About a week later it suddenly stopped working . The PSP no longer recognizes it and when I plug it into my laptop I get a message saying the card needs to be formatted . No problem , just format it , right ? Well , when I try to format it I get a message saying that the card can not be found.I really liked this product at this price ... it 's a shame it did n't work .	-1
I have tried all of the adjustments recommended in the manual and from goggling suggestions others have also had with this item . I ca n't get the sound that I hear to be reasonably good . It is not acceptable for a company that specializes in amplifying sound and making phone use easier and better . Furhter this is supposed to be one of their more established products . I have stopped using the headset system and gone back to just using my normal phone headset . I am very disappointed . Waste of money .	-1
I wish I had spent my $ 80 on something better . I really wanted wireless headsets but got these instead thinking they would be OK . I like to move around when I have these headsets on and the cord gets in the way from the headphones . THey are OK but not worth all of the money that I spent .	-1
I went to replace this battery in my CoolPix P5100 and could not get the battery out of the camera normally . I finally had to force the battery out . It was just in time also , because the battery had swollen in the middle on front and back . It is a genuine Nikon EN-EL5 battery and the camera has never been in extreme heat.This is to warn people to check this battery more often than you would another battery.I am trying to find the Warranty Period if anyone knows .	-1
This item was great until it stopped working and that was in less than two months . I wrote to the company I bought it from and hope that they will do a replacement with one that does work . Waiting to hear back from them . I realize these things can happen , so I truly am hoping they will replace it .	-1
I wish I had read the reviews . My first one of these was broken out of the box . About 20 % of the left clicks didnt actually click . I thought it was a rare defect so I returned it for a replacement . After about 2 months , this new mouse is doing the same thing . I click and nothing happens , or I double click and it only registers a single click.What use is a mouse if it wont click ! ?	-1
Canon offers similar lens with image stabilization for about 20 % less.By not offering image stabiliztion in-body , both Canon and Nikon extrorts permium each time you buy a lens . As far as this lens is concerned , for most users are better of with two fast primes and will be cheaper as well . Unfortunately , 50mm F1.4 is only Nikon prime that auto focuses on sub-D90 bodies . Current generation of Nikon bodies are best of the breed , but they do n't lens selection Canon offers .	-1
I lost my Sony MDR NC5 after having it for 15 months . I found this model on the web with good reviews about it . I thought I would give it a try . Sound quality was not as good as the Sony . But hey , it was cheaper . I could not complain . However , after using it for only 2 months , the plastic wire covering started tearing off at the bottom of both ear pieces , exposing the wire . I have been very careful not to pull the wire because I need the headphone on the noisy bus every weekday . Two more months later it stopped working . I am going back to Sony .	-1
6-pin end 1/8 '' too short ; this is obviously a factory second . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR .	-1
I installed this item on a vacation cabin . It functioned for about 2 days , then constantly went into `` alarm '' . After several troubleshooting attempts , I concluded the transmitter of this item is defective . ( I have installed this item before w/no problems ) As I have misplaced my PO for this , hopefully the seller will offer a replacement .	-1
I had to grind down male jack from wire from antenna before it would fit in my Siruis input jack . It was a pain.I was dissapointed size of the actual antenna was not bigger , but my reception seems to be OK .	-1
I 've bought the cable for using it with my notebook ( SPDIF out ) and my home Theater Receiver YAMAHA . It does n't fit my receiver optical input , actually is completly different from all others optical cables I have .	-1
I bought this filter along with my wide angle lens ( Nikkor 10-24mm ) . Important to mention that I own about 10 different B+W filters within my bag ; and was disappointed with this one . I can barely see the effect of the graduation in my pictures.Definitely not recommended , and thinking of investing in the Lee rectangular-shaped filters as they are more user-friendly and gives you more freedom to adjust the GD filter according to the scene.I gave it 2 stars , only for the superior quality of B+W products !	-1
This is a handy device , built to last . It does one thing only , blasts air when you squeeze it , and does this well . Helps blow dust off camera equipment so you do n't touch the galss to clean it . Simple product . Well constructed . Should last a lifetime . You use it to blow air on stuff you do n't want to touch . That 's all I have to say about that .	-1
This does n't perform any better than a disposable enema bulb for $ 1.00 at Wal-mart . I 'm surprised about the reviews here . I went back to the air can dusters .	-1
Title says it all , on the first use trying to clean the sensor of my Canon 40D it broke something . The mirror mechanism no longer functions properly and the camera shows an error when trying to take pictures . Not sure the bust of air that this thing creates is gentle enough - maybe for front element lens cleaning , but not for sensor cleaning !	-1
I bought this because it was cheap on sale and I repented big time . Spent almost 12 days configuring it but Microsoft Technical support could not configure it with my D-Link DI-624 Super G router . They were not able to setup encryption key and was not able to detect my wireless network . Microsoft transfers their tech . support calls to Far East country like India and most Level 1 support technicians do n't know much beyond simple manual reading knowledge . Worst , their manager used to call me after midnight . Is that a time to call back ? ? ? At least they should check which time zone they are calling . And in middle of night asking my e-mail address where he can send solution ? ? After having their case open more than 10 days he still could n't find my e-mail address in their database with my ticket . Worst technical support . If u want to be bothered in middle of night like 1 a.m. buy this one and enjoy harassment .	-1
It works as advertised , but there is a faint hiss and mixed static in the background . It reminds me of when you are traveling and your are just starting to lose the station . The signal is weak , but listenable.Positives : - Solid and well built feel- Easy to use and set up- Signal strong enough to even overcome active stations- ListenableNegatives ; - Sound is only fair most times to good sometimes . If you are looking for cd quality sound , you will be frustrated.I gave this 2 stars because I had somewhat higher expectations . Based upon the reviews here I hoped the sound would have been at least consistently good . However , having a slightly static laced collection of hundres of songs is still better than good reception from the local FM stations . This limited endorsement is not so much a testament to how much I like this item , as it is to how much I hate local FM radio.I will keep this item only because I ca n't stand to listen to the local FM stations any more . I tried the portable XM radio MyFi to improve my channel selection . I found that I could n't get an adequate signal on that without rigging up antennas to my car , which I was not willing to do . In short , this arrangement was my last option .	-1
This may be a great product . It may be a total piece of crap . Most people will never know because it was apparently designed by someone who 'd never actually been in a car . Many cars cigarette lighters ( or more politically correct `` accessory power ports '' ) are designed to sit inside the ashtray or under a dashboard . The genius who designed this product decided it needed an enormous fat knob on the end of it to support the `` monster '' logo . This knob guarantees that you will never get the charger to seat properly . I own four cars and I could n't place it in any of them . Save yourself the hassle , money , and time and avoid this ill designed piece of crap .	-1
If your cars Dash is curved or sloping , this mount will not work . Did not work on a 1988 Mercedes 300E or a Daewoo Lanos . It might work if you have a perfectly FLAT dash . I had to return the item as it did not sit properly . Even the slightest touch from a finger would make it slide down . Those of you who are clean freaks like me , BEWARE . Products like armour all which leave a protective coating on your dash will further reduce the grip of this stand ! I would not trust a $ 800 piece of equipment on an unreliable stand like this when even a slight touch of a finger can make it slide down . What about jolts and bumps while normal driving ? I did not wait to find out using my $ 800 GPS as an experiment !	-1
A couple of things ... First , I had to learn the hard way that this device is not Windows Supported . You wou n't learn about it until its too late , but most products go through testing to be certified as Windows Compatable . This is not . They either have n't passed Windows testing or have n't bothered.That said , it was n't until I defragmented the drive and had over 150GB of information erased . Initially , I thought it was the defragmentation program , but after running a diagnostic on the drive , I found that it has a physical defect.It was n't until I researched that I found that this is common with this brand . Also , the USB cord is about 15 inches long . So do n't plan on putting it anywhere far from your computer.Yes . It has an OK design by Porsche . Too bad the it does n't run like a Porsche . This is an extremely compact drive , with no heat sink whatsoever . The drive gets VERY VERY hot . While researching my own problems with this drive , I found that many people have lost their data due to it overheating.Purchase at your own risk ! ( OR install your own cooling system that the manufacturer forgot , get a longer USB , and scan for defects when you first get it ) ! ! Not recommended if you have data that you ca n't live without ... you risk losing it using this drive ! **** However , LaCie Seems to have gotten it right with their new eSATA drives ( available here on amazon.com ) . Now , there are 2 similar 'looking ' drives , d2 and SATA external ... I 'm referring to the external SATA . ( Triple Interface Firewire , USB etc . is just too slow for a hard drive , get the external SATA ( eSATA ) if you can ) . LaCie resolves heat issus and speed issues ( with the SATA not firewire or usb ) in their new external SATA drive . At the very least , it is as fast as your internal hard drive ( SATA only , not usb or firewire ) . So , to get a low cost high quality blazing fast drive , which LaCie can give , search Amazon for LaCie External SATA , I 've got 2 !	-1
Please learn from my mistake . Unfortunately , this item is mislabeled as a `` quick recycling battery pack '' when it is only an empty battery `` container '' , i.e. , a plastic box that houses a single AA cell ( that you must generously provide ) to increase the recycling capacity of the SB-800 slightly . But Nikon already furnishes such a box with every new SB-800 , so unlike true rechargeable battery `` packs '' , this one is neither a `` Battery Pack '' nor remotely `` Quick Recycling '' . Accordingly , do n't consider buying it unless you have lost or damaged the one already included the SB-800 .	-1
Received my 7216 Nikon binoculars . I am stating which series I bought because Amazon bundles together several in their reviews which is not right.I know what to do with binoculars ... but for the life of me can not see out of these ! They are not in focus no matter what I do ! ! ! A real waste of money . Truly a waste of money ... ... ..What 's more is that I really needed them ! I believed in the reviews and got a `` lemon '' pair I guess .	-1
My mini was 6-stars-cool-completly-awesome , beyond all my expectations . I used it almost all day every work day , and in the car , and in the garden , and in bed , and ... I loved it . Until it died . In fact , -+*everyone*+- I know with a mini has **sent it back** . They 're not all that reliable when they 're not dead . If you 're one of the lucky ones that has n't had the crackly death you can expect a solid 12 months with your mini until you need a $ 100 battery . I 've taken my $ elsewhere . It 's sad because it was my friend .	-1
IF you can get the headphones to stay securely in your ear the sound is pretty phenomenal . Alas , I can not get the d*mn things to stay securely seated in my ear canal . While they come with three different sized rubber nubs to fit your ear size , the rubber nubs are easily overcome by the weight of the wires and constantly fall out of position . Once out of position in your ear canal the sound quality diminishes greatly and the music is overwhelmed by bass-less treble ( reminds me of AM radio ) . Unless you plan on remaining perfectly stationary while listening through your earphones keep shopping for more reliable headphones . And if you plan on listening at the gym you should forget about these headphones altogether !	-1
These are the worst earbuds on the market . Plain and simply put they do n't fit -- none of the three sizes -- and they do n't make anything sound better than my original earbuds that came with the iPod . I returned them after two days of trying and trying and trying to give them a chance . Overall review : S for suck .	-1
After a month , the battery cover broke and is inoperable ... so no portability , and the led display on the radio never did work . Very poor quality . Spend your money on a better Delphi unit .	-1
When I hooked up my SkyFi radio in this device and turned on the unit , what I heard was a constant low frequency oscillating sound - the best I can describe it is a `` motorboat '' noise . I heard the satellite radio , but during quiet passages - especially on talk shows and interviews/comments on radio channels - it was extremely annoying . So , I tried muting the sound and the noise continued unabated at the same volume . You could mask it by turning up the volume , but on some jazz , classical , and talk channels it was always there , annoyingly so.I tried using headphones , thinking it was a speaker problem , but it was still there . Then , I figured it might be a bad power supply and tried batteries - annoying background sound was still there . So this item is going back - it 's a real shame because it 's a nice device , but fails miserably in it 's intended purpose ( at least for me ) and that is making satellite radio portable.I tried AM and FM radio and the performance is surprisingly good . But , the manual is completely wrong as to how to store presets for these modes . The manual says that in order to choose what preset number under which to store the station you should hit the `` tune '' button . In fact , you hit the `` seek '' button . Until I stumbled on this , I was going crazy trying to get the manual 's instructions to work on my device . Also , the `` Menu '' button on the remote control does NOT put the satellite SkyFi into menu mode as the instructions say it should . As it turns out I found about a half dozen places where the manual is dead wrong.I did not try the device with playing a CD - audio or mp3 . When I realized the device was useless to me for playing satellite radio , I gave up and decided to use my SkyFi home kit with cheap powered speakers.A real shame - this had the promise of being a really nice device . By the way , Delphi `` tech support '' never responded to my inquiries . I understand by looking at other reviews that this is not unusual .	-1
I use this switch with a Windows XP machine and a G5 Power Mac running OS X 10.3.8 . I chose not to install the software that would enable hotkey switching since the included software is Windows-only . The only way you can switch from a Mac with this switch is by using the manual button on the switch . So I ca n't speak to any software issues -- all I 'm trying to do is plug the thing in and try to press the button to switch from one computer to the other.The product behaves erratically , switching between computers at random while I 'm working . Most of the time , the button does not respond or will switch from computer 1 to computer 2 but immediately switch back . It is completely useless . It looks nice and it would be great if it performed as advertised , but it has not worked at all for me .	-1
Despite the mixed reviews here , I decided to gamble and take a chance on the Iogear GCS632U since I 've had previous success with their switches . However , I immediately ran into problems with my mouse and keyboard . ( Video looked great . ) When I contacted Iogear support via their online form , they sent the following blurb back to me . I 'm pasting it here so those of you who are still making a purchasing decision can have this information in addition to the incomplete product description provided above : '' Please ensure that you are using a native wired mouse and keyboard as wireless devices or any types of converters/adapters are NOT supported and will not work . Also docking stations or port replicator will interfere with proper KVM functionality and special keys on multimedia keyboards are not supported and will not work . ''	-1
This KVM switch worked for all of about 10 minutes before I started having problems with it . I have since replaced it with a larger KVM with more features . I refuse to sell this KVM because I do n't want someone else inheriting the problems with this KVM .	-1
This is my second Iogear KVM , my first being the full PS/2 version . So far I have been pretty disappointed with this KVM . It disconnects frequently , forcing you to swtich between your computers in order to re-establish the connection with your mouse . For me , this happens as frequent as every 5-10 minutes.I really wish I could go back to my old KVM , but unfortunately my new computer does n't have PS/2 ports .	-1
Unit Failure : I tried everything , and I could only get one of the two USB ports to function . Tried mouse , keyboard , flash card reader ... everything worked on side one ; nothing on side two . Strange thing is that they all got power -- the mouse lit up , the flash card reader lit up -- but were n't recognized . Attempted on second workstation with same results . Not sure if this is a defective unit or just bad design.Design Flaw : The only way to switch between computers is a keyboard `` hot key '' combination . However , I COULD NOT GET ANY COMBINATION TO WORK . I tried everything in the book , and nothing would switch computers . I could type fine ; the unit simply refused to recognize any attempt to switch . I have no idea if this is an issue with my keyboard or the switch.Functional Quirks : Even with the side that worked , I noticed irregularities . When I first plugged-in my mouse , my PC did n't see any changes . Even after a restart , nothing . On a whim , I unplugged the mouse from the switch and inserted into Computer , which the PC immediately recognized . I then unplugged/plugged into switch , and the PC recognized it this time with the switch . Same behavior with the keyboard . Experience was not consistent , i.e . I restarted several times afterward and it seemed to be ok.Summary:1 . Due to the design flaw ( keyboard switching ) , I was not able to successfully switch between computers ; and , thus , could not confirm the unit would switch between PC and Mac.2 . Due to the product flaw ( bad switch ) , I was simultaneously able to use a keyboard or a mouse , but not both at the same time.3 . Due to the irregularities of the one working USB port , I do not have sufficient faith in this unit to exchange for another one . The last thing I want is to spend two weeks getting a replacement only to have plug the mouse in and out of the PC periodically to get it to work.Recommendation : I do not recommend this unit or this vendor under any circumstances . Find a unit with a hard button switch to prevent any keyboard `` hot key '' incompatibility . You obviously get what you pay for . If any one has any suggestions , feel free to email me at mikeamburn @ hotmail.comComputer 1 : Windows XP ProfessionalComputer 2 : new Mac MiniPeripherals : Microsoft Natural Keyboard , Microsoft Optical Mouse	-1
This does not work with cordless keyboards-mouse units.Also makes speakers sound bad .	-1
Completely unreliable . Printing is hit and miss . More miss than hit . And I need reliability . EVERY print job comes back with a `` failed to print '' message , whether it prints or not . When jobs do go through they are agonizingly slow . If I owned a gun I 'd use it for target practice ; it 's that aggravating.Installing the printer driver on the remote computers is a pain - do it over and over until it decides the time is right . It was loaded and kind'a working on one laptop , but has simply stopped and wo n't be reloaded . Called Netgear about a different piece of equipment and the experience was so bad I refuse to call them again . All the guy could say was it 's 'software and the software is out of warranty . ' I did n't fight 'em ; trashed it and bought Linksys . Now I 'm going to trash this `` thing '' and see what Linksys has for print servers . Do NOT waste your money .	-1
I bought the printer driver a few weeks back and was able to get it working on my desktop but not with the laptop ... It has been resolved and is working but some settings I needed to do and were not explained in the instructions ... 1 ) The printer server was able to print the test page after installation but would not print from any applications ... The reason for this is that Netgear does not set the ports up correctly and it was still detecting the port as USB instead of a TCP/IP port . To solve this you need to go into the printer settings and add a TCP/IP port with the printer IP address given after installation ... For some reason my version of windows XP did not recognize the printer server ... If this happens , choose Network Printer Server ( 1 port ) on each device that prints to the printer ... The installation was also interesting as well ... 1 ) The instructions tell you to connect the blue cable that came with the router to the printer server ... The printer server kit does not come with any cable ... I had an extra ethernet cable which did not work since it is looking for a crossover cable ... 2 ) You may need to turn off the firewall ; I did ( this is actually mentioned ) ... After installation , there is a printer server window popup that shows the printer server , and if you want to reserve it ( for multifunction printers ) ... If you refresh this window or reboot the PC , you can no longer see the printer server in the window . This feature can be accessed in the system tray as well ... It seems like a software bug ... As others have mentioned , documentation is poor ... I was also lucky that my father helped me to get this working since he has installed printer drivers ... Once it is working , it seems to work fine ...	-1
Absolutely could not get this device to work properly . Halfway through a recording the software froze and forced reboot to recover . Did this on both analog and digital source files . Interesting nowhere in the manual or on the website was there anything about `` trouble shooting '' . No weekend support so back it goes .	-1
For the first few months worked fine and setup was easy . However after few months , it just died ! No warranty - nothing could be done . This is the second Dlink router that has failed on me ... I have switched to netgear - much happier !	-1
I already had a SanDisk 1GB Ultra II CF card and decided that I could use a 2GB in order tostore more photos on it.My purpose was to store as many images at its LOWEST resolution possible , just in case I started tolose image space on the card . This year , I 'm going to Italy , so I knew I 'd be taking a ton of shots.Of course , I 'd start with taking shots with the HIGHER resolution , but if I found that I was running out ofspace on the CF card , its always good to know that you can always lower the resolution if you have to..I 'm not a professional . I 've taken lower resolution shots that pleased me beause I had `` captured the moment '' and that 's what 's important to me.My present SanDisk 1GB CF card can store 999 images at its LOWEST resolution..My camera is a Canon Digital Rebel XT 8 megapixels..When I got this new 2GB CF card . I formated it , and then saw that it could only store 999 images.Just the same as the 1GB card.So , either I did something wrong , or the card was defective.I sent it back .	-1
When you get the correlating linksys speed boost router , you do get the advertised 50mbps.I found it fairly easy to install.Once setup though , I found I lost the wireless connection . I would then have to drag an ethernet cord from my computer to the router , and go thru the wizard to re-set it . This happened probably once a day for a week.A 10 minute hassle that I was n't willing to go on with . I still am not sure if I should blame the card or the routerAlso , I use my computer for gaming and decided that 50mbps was n't good enough for me . ( ironforge lag anyone ? ) So i returned the wireless card , and kept the router . I 'm using it like a regular-old router with an ethernet , and it works just fine .	-1
As a field technician of my own corporation . Linksys over the years has been doing a terrible job on all of there products . Very terrible quality and compatibility . I recently bought quite of few of these wireless N and G network cards for customers and hand hardware errors after install . ( The blue screen of death ) I will never recommend or buy another linksys network card again . There routers are O.K . but those to are getting made with poor quality also . I will recommend D-link and NET GEAR . These campanies make each product so simple to install and the software that comes with there products are amazing , so is the quality . Hope this helps..	-1
My PC kept shutting down and on reboot the POST would give me a message that stated `` PC shutdown due to overtemp . '' This card also caused my AGP video card to stop working , so I had to revert to the integrated video port just to see the monitor . The card did work for a few minutes and then it froze my PC ( this was when it did not overtemp the motherboard ) . I tried other PCI slots , and it worked for a few minutes but then froze the computer again . It was very sporadic and difficult to try and troubleshoot . I have not tried any other cards in my PCI slots , so it MAY be a problem with my motherboard , but I do n't think so . The only solution to get my computer to work was to completely remove the card and switch to the Belkin USB Network Adapter ( P57265 ) . It works great.I swear by Linksys routers - both wired and wireless - as they are solid as a rock , but this is my second bad experience with Linksys PCI wireless cards ( I tried the one without speed booster a few years ago and had to replace it with a D-link card . The D-link card worked fine in a few minutes ) .Again , this may just be a problem with my PC , but I am just warning against users who are trying to connect it to a Dell Optiplex .	-1
I had a totally bad experience with this router . I never got it to work . And Linksys tech support was flakey when reachable , but generally not reachable . They have multiple web addresses allegedly available to support this product ( why not just one ? ) and all of them were useless.All I can say is : 1 ) Avoid this product . 2 ) Thank goodness for Amazon 's convenient return policy .	-1
If you 're thinking of ordering this for use with third-party open-source firmware like Alchemy or DD-WRT , you 're out of luck . The router that now ships is `` WRT54GS v.5 '' , which is vastly different from v.1 , v.2 , v.3 , and v.4 . Version 5 does not use Linux-based firmware and is therefore not flashable with third-party firmware . You 'll have to find an older version on eBay etc.I ordered this thinking I could use Alchemy , not realizing it came in different versions , since Amazon 's product info does n't list a version number . Now I 'm out shipping costs in both directions , and I 'm pissed . Do n't end up like me.Just letting you know : )	-1
I purchased this router to replace another wireless router that kept dropping connections . Upon opening the box I was greeted with a big warning sticker that said `` Run CD before plugging in router ! '' OK - so I ran through the install instructions with the CD and I could literally never connect to the Internet and my laptop would n't see the network . I tried for about 6 hours , running through every set of troubleshooting instructions I could find . I finally gave up completely and returned the router.Now , even though I uninstalled the Linksys software - the wireless settings on my laptop get changed about 3 minutes after I boot up , preventing me from connecting to my current network . The only software I have installed is Linksys install - so it is clear that there is something still resident in my system that is rendering my laptop incapable of connecting to any wireless network .	-1
Not hardly . It works OK given the 15 foot distance it needs to effect . Beyond that it is just on and off .	-1
I bought this camcorder for my wife . After using it for a while , we just stopped . Indoor pictures , even with lights on , are very grainy . And unfortunately , we would shoot a lot indoors.In order to move the video to a computer , you need a Firewire cable and Firewire on your computer , and additional software not supplied with the camcorder . I would n't mind this , execpt the camcorder also has USB connectivity . Everyone has USB , but you ca n't send the video over USB , only still pics.The basic shooting controls are easy enough to figure out , but beyond that , the controls are very unintuitive . The control panel tucked in where the LCD screen comes out has myriad buttons , and it 's not obvious what they all do.I remember shortly after I bought this , Consumer Reports came out with their evaluations of Camcorders . This one was at the very bottom of the ones they rated , and in my opinion , for good reason .	-1
Apple wrote the software for harman/kardon SoundSticks II . I am running Mac OS 10.4.11 and they no longer work.The reason is they are no longer updating it for the Mac . I called and emailed both Apple and harman/kardon . Harman/kardon told me this , `` Apple wrote the software and they no longer support SoundSticks II for Mac OS 's over 10.4 '' . Apple will not admit it and they act stupid like they did not have anything to do with harman/kardon SoundSticks II . When I was able to use SoundSticks before , it was great . Apple screws us again !	-1
I got this item and it worked fine for quite sometime , but now when I try to use it , it wo n't connect to the wireless access point . I tried reinstalling Windows but it was still acting up .	-1
This is a lousy wifi adapter . I barely got to this page on it . Terrible range ; my laptop does fine and my router is at the other end of my whole-floor brownstone apartment , that 's probably over 70 ft away with 2 plaster walls in between . 4 bars consistently . This can rarely get above 2 bars . Constantly loses connection - cancelled downloads ahoy ! Vague , confusion instructions . Nothing but a waste of time . Do not buy . Especially if you were trying to use it on Windows 7 like me . There are 64-bit adapters available . I am returning this as it is effectively broken , and trying one of those .	-1
I was looking for an inexpensive digital camera for my daughter , and the Olympus D-395 seemed to fit the bill . We ended up returning the camera , however , because it had some serious flaws : - changing camera settings ( picture quality , etc . ) resets to the standard setting after turning the camera off . This means if you want pictures at a lower quality , you have to set this every time you start up the camera.- the battery life is poor . Standard AA 's do n't last long at all ( we did not try NiMH or other rechargeables ) .- the response time from depressing the shutter to taking a picture is longer than any other digital camera I 've tried.- the on-screen menuing is very confusing and not intuitive . We always had to consult the manual to figure out how to do simple things like erase all pictures on the camera.So even though the price is right , the camera is not , and I suggest you look at something a little more expensive and more capable .	-1
Installed easily under XP Pro and worked fine for 3 months . Then Windows stopped recognizing it except every once in a while . When it was recognized , the disk showed up as empty . Do n't buy .	-1
The literature that comes with the drive would suggest it 's just plug and play , but it 's not that easy.On my Dell 4100 with ME , it required four hours of work to get it recognized . First , they do n't tell you that in ME , you have to go into device manager and mark the drive `` remote . '' Even then , it took several resets and more monkeying around and another call to support to get the computer to recognize the drive.Next comes formatting . ME would n't recognize it as formatted . After formatting , ME would n't recognize the drive -- said insert disc . More resets . Then it required Scan Disc . And Scan Disc crashed during the process.More resets . Finally started working , but it has slowed down the system . I 'm using USB 2.0 and it is dog slow on writes and reads.To make matters worse , Amazon doubled the order when it sent it to SimpleTech . So I get 2 drives and have to return the second one . SimpleTech supplied an RMA number , along with a warning they would not be responsible for any damage to the drive or loss of the drive in shipping if I did n't insure it . Why should that be my problem ? I wish I 'd bought a WD . The tech could n't tell me what brand drive is inside the case . Kind of scary having 232 GB of data on a drive you do n't even know who made .	-1
We bought three of these drives over a period of several months . Not one of them lasted more than 6 months . The failures all started the same : The computer would not recognize the drive , then it would , then it would n't , until one day it finally stopped recognizing it completely . Rather than return the drives , I installed them in an old computer we are using as a server . Two of the drives had to be reformatted , and only one still had all the files on it . So it appears the problem is with the drive enclosures and not the drives themselves . My recommendation ? Do n't put anything on one of these drives that you ca n't afford to lose .	-1
If $ 160 for 250 gigs sounds too good to be true ... it 's because it is.I bought this drive based on three solid reviews here . I wanted a drive for my Windows XP system to simply back up files ( artwork , video and audio ) . I figured not having a firewire option might slow transfers down , but that really did n't concern me for this purchase . I just needed a good , large back up drive.When I received my drive , I plugged it in and everything seemed fine . Upon closer inspection I noticed the green `` activity light '' was hard to see . This is because the bulb is not in position behind the black transluscent face guard . I can see that the green light exists and operates correctly with drive activity , but it 's not where it should be ( seems like shoddy construction to me ) . The red `` power light '' is where it should be.The REAL issue is this : when I started transferring files ( trying to at least ) I ran into major problems.I can transfer small bits of information SOMETIMES ( text files , small images one at a time , etc ... ) , but when trying to transfer larger amounts of data ( anything over 12MB or so , say , a folder of MP3 's , or a photo directory ) the drive hangs , and then causes my system to hang . At first I thought this might be an issue with transferring external hard drive data to another external hard drive , but it happens with ALL data , including data from my on-board hard drive . Often simply powering on the drive causes the system to hang ( the system recognizes the device , but then freezes after trying to interface ) .When I do get data to transfer , the exchange is pretty slow . I assumed this drive would be a little slower , but it 's a LOT slower.Sometimes there 's a `` clunk-sproing , clunk-sproing , clunk-sproing . '' Sometime 's the drive seems to be reading/writing correctly ( the green light is on -- somewhere back there -- and the drive makes the right sounds ) but nothing happens as far as data transfer goes . The system thinks it 's transferring files , but it 's just hanging there.It 's also a task to get the drive to show up . Various combinations of plugging and unplugging the drive , powering up and down , unmounting the drive , etc ... will get you a drive letter , but sometimes it 's a task . My system gives the `` new equipment '' alert when I power up the drive , or connect the USB , but it often does n't show up in Explorer . I 've never had this issue with any of my other USB drives . With them , it 's `` power on=immediate drive assignment . `` Windows XP computer management tools state that the drive is `` healthy , '' but who cares if the disk itself is OK if you ca n't send and retrieve data from that place ? I use computers everyday , so I am fairly confident that this is not an issue with my machine , or my tech knowledge.I will be sending this back today ( I 've had the drive four days , and I 'm finally giving up ) . I 'm not looking forward to the hassle of the return.Do yourself a favor and buy the Seagate 160 gig ( I ca n't vouch for the higher capacity drives , as I 've only got the 160 's ) . I 've got two and I 've never had an issue with either . They 're solid and fast ( I record pro-audio straight to these external hard drives over USB OR Firewire ) .	-1
I am not one to give 1 star just because the unit I happened to receive turns out to be defective , but I have seen a pattern both here I these Amazon reviews and on the web that indicates an endemic lack of reliability . Since all people will want from a hard drive such as this are : capacity , speed , ease of use and reliability ... and since without that last one the other do not amount to anything , I therefore give this 2 stars.My story in brief : - Windows XP sp2- Drive was usually powered on ( i.e . of the two usage scenarios : 1-always on or 2-only powered on occasionally to do a backup , mine was scenario 1 ) - Used the drive for about 1 year , before seeing any problem- Drive started acting flaky ... usually giving the `` usb device not recognized '' error whenever the drive was powered on or connected to the PC- Drive would intermittently work ( be recognized ) , but only as a USB 1.0 device ( i.e . slow ) Possible instigating factor : - The drive did not appear to like it when the computer went on stand-by . Usually when coming out stand-by the drive would not be recognized until power-cycled- The flakiness described above was first noticed upon the PC coming out of stand-by on one occasion.Solution : I cracked the case , took out the HD , and installed it internally in the PC . Seems to be working well . This indicates this was not a drive problem , but a problem with the USB drive enclosure ( which is what SimpleTech is bringing to the game here ) .	-1
The image is dark and too wide . I spent my time trying to constantly get a better focus with it . junk .	-1
Total rubbish , this is a toy , and that 's no joke , 10 x 25 is a joke , good at maybe 100 feet , totally useless , i question the good ratings on this product , extremely poor quality product , i have always said that a man is as good as his name , no matter how cheap something is you should take pride in your name .	-1
I love being able to get wide angle shots , and I had high hopes for this lens . However , I have yet to get a crisp , sharp image out of it . I 've had it on both auto focus and manual focus , on a tripod using a remote shutter release and mirror lockup , and still only ever get slightly hazy or blurry pictures . I 'm not sure if I have a bad unit , or it 's a problem with the design , or I 'm just not using it right . And , alas , it 's too late to send the lens back .	-1
I thought this looked like a great option to buying the microsoft cordless USB laser mouse that everyone in my family was using when I went to visit them . It was also cheaper where I went . If I had n't been out of time , I 'd have ordered from Amazon : ) . As it is , I have to pop it open to take the batteries out to keep it from turning itself on . I do n't know how it does it , since you have to use a pen/paper clip - but it does . I 'm really wish I had n't been too cheap , to spend the extra $ 5 . BTW - here on Amazon - the Microsoft Mouse is cheaper .	-1
When I started to buy Sandisk , I buyed `` normal '' Memory Sticks . As time passes I do n't get any problem with them ( five 128 mb Sandisk memory Sticks ) . The next step was MS PRO , so I buyed two sticks 256 and 512 MB . Unfortunately I got a `` Memory Stick Error '' ( C:13:01 ) on my Sony DSC-P150 , with the 256 mb memory stick pro and it became useless , so beware with this cheap buy .	-1
Reception both in my house on 2 different stereos and in 3 different cars was all equally abysmal . There was always static and I obviously could n't find a good station . I live in a suburb of Denver , and although we have quite a few radio stations , I was expecting it to at least find one good station . I gave it 2 stars because the interface seemed to work well and set up was easy .	-1
In spite of less than sparkling reviews from others , I have it a try . I have no idea where the FM antennae is on my Expedition . It 's probably embedded in a window somewhere but this Belkin only works well if I hold it up to the windshield near the mirror . Anywhere else and it 's too noisy to enjoy . I chose this because some of the higher rated units had to be plugged in to a lighter adapter and I wanted something I could use where there was no 12vdc plugI ca n't see this being of use unless you live where there are only a couple of FM stations on the air . Otherwise , you 'll get bleed through unless you tape it to the radio in the right position . In my car , it 's essentially worthless .	-1
Short story ... My 1st one broke after one month , Belkin sent a new one ( I had to give a credit card number and pay for shipping back ... no big deal ) Easy to use , poor sound . I 've tried different MP3 players , FM receivers , batteries , frequencies , settings ... no luck . Sounds a little worse that Am radio . More muffled . Good luck !	-1
I hate to write derogatory reviews , but by doing so I just might keep someone else from wasting money on this device . 1 . Poor sound quality . Very poor . 2. on/off switch is a joke . Be prepared to insert new batteries each time you use it .	-1
I do n't recommend this ones , because it does n't give a good volume on your receiver .	-1
I had been looking for a good FM Tuner to use with my Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra . I had heard good reviews about this product so I picked it up . Now , I was n't expecting crystal clear CD-quality sound , but I was expecting something listenable , which explains my dissatisfaction with this product.The product is easy enough to use . You plug the Belkin into the headphone or line out jack of your player , then find a poor quality radio station , tune your Belkin to it , and hit play . The Belkin can run on 2 AAA batteries or off your car 's cigarette lighter . My first problem with it , is that the cigarette lighter adapter would not fit securely into the Belkin . It fell out at the slightest touch , as the hole in the Belkin was just too big . I either had to tape it in their , or had to run off the batteries , which run down surprisingly quick.My next problem , is with the general size of the device . The cord that connects the Belkin to your audio player is about 3 inches long , which means you have to keep it right next to the player . You ca n't attach it to your dashboard or anything like that . It made it very awkward to change the song or skip through something on the player because I had this tuner hanging down from it.My final , and biggest problem with the player is the poor reception . I tried it with three different vehicles , and two different MP3 players . I tried every single radio station I could find . I tried every tip I found on the Internet to get good quality . I adjusted the volume on the player and in the car . I turned on the radio first , and then the player , and vice versa . I just could n't get a decent sound from it . It would sound okay for a few seconds , and then static.Something to note , is that the poorest quality station wo n't always give you the best sound . I sometimes found that I received the best sound from a station that I could somewhat get a broadcast from , even though the manual tells you to look for the weakest stations . The other problem is that if you 're in your car , the signal strength of the radio stations change depending on where you are , so the sound quality is going to always vary . I also found that I could only get real good quality when I held the mp3 player and Belkin in my lap , and held onto it . As soon as I let go , I get a little bit of static . The range for this thing in a car is realistically about 2 feet.One thing I did get a good reception with was with home stereos , where the quality was decent enough to use . But this was pretty pointless for me because I can simply plug in my mp3 player directly into the stereo anyway.Bottom line , if you can live with sub par quality and do n't mind the awkwardness of the Tuner , this is probably the best tuner you will find out there today . Unfortunately , that does n't account for much until technology provides for better reception in the future .	-1
This is a neat , handy little gadget but it failed to perform to my expectations . The sound quality is terrible . If you like listening to FM stations with lots of static , then this is for you . Otherwise , stay away . Far away . If you must try it out , please buy from a local store and NOT online because you will want to return it and online purchases are a pain to return .	-1
I am very good with electronic gadgets but I had no luck whatsoever with the Belkin Tunecast II . I had to place the unit very close to my radio to get reception . Even then , the signal was weak and the sound quality was horrible .	-1
This is the worst FM modulator I have used and owned . Soundsworst than FM radio on the radio .	-1
I can not close the battery cover ! Belt clip must be used.It is brand new .	-1
THESE REMIND ME OF WAY BACK WHEN PHONOGRAPH RECORDS WERE MADE OF SHELLAC ! They are brittle and very breakable , new set lasted 5 days ! One drop on a wood floor is enough to wreck then . Do not buy if you are less than very gentle on all equipment ! I love being able to hear TV without projecting electronic sound into the local environment . This headset works well and is a good value , but the fit is a constant problem . I am 5'7 '' tall , female , and my head measures about 23.25 '' around , taken at just above the ears/eyebrows . These headphones are too large and do not adjust to small enough width . Like many tools and one-size-fits-all objects , the big guys win . Everyone smaller than some `` average man '' has to deal with over-sized things that do n't work as well for us.The headphones slip off and go flying if I look down , bend to pick something up , turn my head quickly , etc . The result is dropping this over and over , and it is now in pieces . I carefully put it back together to make it last . Short of donning a headband/scarf arrangement over the headset to secure it to my head with every use , I know they will fall again . When it lands on the wood floor , the batteries fall out , the ear pad covers come off and one of the stems snaps off . That 's six pieces to retrieve and reassemble . Very annoying . Do they test these at all on average people for fit and usefulness ? These could be made of more durable material , with a better , less breakable design , and a greater range of adjustment for fit . The ear pads also could be replaceable/washable , because the fabric gathers sweat/oil from the face/hair and they become unclean . This headset is way better than nothing ( since having these , I rarely listen to TV aloud in a room ) . I 'd like to see improvement , rather than buy a new headset every 6 to 9 months . All that said , it 's worth having . Many people will have less trouble with them . Satisfaction/success variables include : carpeted environment ( softer landing if they fall ) , head size ( larger than mine should fit much better ) , time spent in use ( I wear them every day/use them a lot ) .	-1
Pretty good sound when it works if you do n't mind a little humming sound now and then , but it often shuts off completely for no apparent reason . To get it to play after shut off , I have to unplug whatever device I had plugged into the base unit and re-plug in and then maybe it will work for a few minutes . Sometimes when it shuts off the sound from the device that I want to listen to , it plays the neighbor 's TV station into the headset . Basically worthless junk because of unreliability . I wasted hard earned money on this junk .	-1
I bought a set of reconditioned headphones from a different vendor . When I got them the right side had no audio and the left side hissed and the audio was no better then a set of 1 dollar headphones for a walkman . About a year ago I bought a set of Aucostic Research wireless headphonse from Amazon for about 100 bucks and they perform 1000 percent better then these . Stick with 2.4GIG technology and nothing less ! Also about a year ago I bought a set of the Sony 900MHZ at Best Buy before I bought the Aucoutics and the sound quality was not great and the distance was poor as well . Hope this helps .	-1
setup time 30 minutes testing on several tvs and outputs trying to figure out what is wrong with my brand new headphones oh wait they shipped it with dead `` green '' batterys thanksupdate : NO auto off feature ? that should be a must autooff at maybe 4 hours no , just drain more of MY batteries since you failed to supply a set that worked	-1
I was extremely disappointed with these headphones . The sound quality is horrible , and the material and the craftsmanship is very poor . I felt the loud static would damage my ears . It drops signal frequently and the transmitter gets switched off frequently at a low volume . It would be waste of time and money if you order it . Thanks to Amazon 's return policy , I returned this item . The headphone will go into my trash if I ever get it for free .	-1
I like to read a lot of reviews before purchasing any electronic item and these headphones were no exception . The majority of people rated it very highly so I was sold on the item . Now onto the review ; The Good : It 's fairly priced for what you get . I 've searched everywhere for a decent wireless set that does n't cost triple digits and these fit the bill . Sennheiser has a great reputation and they have some really nice headphones ( but you 'll have to really open your wallet for the good stuff ... this model was not one of those ) . The headphones are extremely comfortable and I was surprised by how light they were . The item looks like it was constructed really well also ( so it was light but well made : ) .The Bad : Others have mentioned this as well but I have to say , the whole issue of the base shutting off when the audio source volume is too low really bothered me . I guess I understand the mechanics of the thing ( the better the source , the better the headphones are able to pic up the sound etc . ) but there should have been a warning or instructions about this issue at least . I had to read reviews here and online forums to figure out that it was not just a faulty headset . I 've had my set for 4 weeks now and the headphones have dropped out on me more than half the time , WITHOUT my source volume decreasing . I do n't know what the deal is but I 'm ready to return them . The item seems to work when it wants to which is not how I like my electronics . Sound quality was ok to good , depends on how many wireless items you going on in the area . I could never really get the `` static '' to go away completely either ( after lots of fine tuning , you still hear it faintly ) . I guess you get what you paid for but still , next time I 'll shill out for some Bose ones or something as these are pretty frustrating .	-1
You would think for the money you pay for something like this that they would work a little more than six months before junking out on a person ? I They worked well for a Short time and then Quit ! ? I hate to say it but after my experience , I sure would n't recommend them to anyone else . Just my opinion .	-1
I bought two sets of these headphones , one for use in my bedroom and one for the living room . The first night I set them up they worked perfectly for 2 hours . The next day I was not able to receive a signal at all in the living room , although the bedroom pair was working fine . I swapped them around and discovered each pair worked fine in the bedroom , but not in the living room . I bought a long cable extension to move the transmitter out of the living room , but that did n't help.I must be getting some kind of interference from somewhere . The bedroom pair started picking up static as well after a week , so I gave up on them . I would rather have a wire connection and know I will have good sound than wonder if my headphones are going to be working or not . But you may not have the interence problems I have . When they work they are good headphones .	-1
I was looking forward to having wireless headphones while going about my daily chores around the house in the garden and on casual walks . I find that while they are comfortable , they do n't stay on my head . When I bend down they fall forward , I am constantly adjusting them , more troublesome than the wires that I was trying to avoid.The quality of the sound when it is tuned properly is good however as you move around there are frequent blasts of static that are totally unacceptable . I guess it would be ok if you put them on and sat in a chair and did n't move . I did n't have that in mind when I bought them , I could do that with my earbuds .	-1
The headphones get too warm , and they 're flat , not very comfortable . Sound is n't great , either . Much prefer the Auvio brand .	-1
Perhaps I 've just been unlucky , but I have found the Sennheiser headphones extremely unreliable . I was very pleased when I first purchased the unit -- after less than a week they went dead ; i.e. , the charger continued to work , but no transmission . I returned the unit and got a replacement . My only annoyance was that , occasionally , it would simply cut off . Gradually this became more common and annoying . I knew it had a 2 year warranty , but did n't realize I had owned it as long as I had . Finally last month , it became impossible to use because of the constant shut-offs . When I checked my warranty & sales slip , I realized I had owned it for two months beyond the warranty . When I prepared to order another one , I mentioned it to my son . Turned out , he had the same problem with his Sennheiser PS 120 and -- though he did n't return it -- he does n't use it any more because of the sound cut-off . I realize that any product can have a lemon , but 3 out of 3 ?	-1
Operated per your instructions , but the unit just quite its operation . Have not used in a long time . I am a Homebound individual , thus getting it out to be repaired ( if possible ) is a difficult situation for me .	-1
The directions for this product leave MUCH to be desired ! I have had it for about a month and can not figure out how to get it to actually work . Wish I had never bought it .	-1
I am very disappointed with this product . The signal does n't go as far as I expected , there is a lot of static interference , the sound is hard to balance , and the headphone band does n't contract small enough to fit a woman 's head snugly .	-1
I do n't have a big head , but it 's not small , either . When wearing this headset while active around the house it invariably falls off with the slightest tilting of my head up or down . Otherwise , no complaints . I would love to return this headset for one that would remain in place when I am moving around . How about it , Sennheiser ?	-1
I really , really wanted this to work . I even bought two headsets , thinking that these would be the solution to our t.v . problems . Unfortunately , the headphones have analog sound jacks and are incompatible with my new t.v.s that have only digital audio outputs ( they have analog inputs , though ) . I went to an electronics store to find out if a digital audio output adapter exists , but the guy looked at me like I was nuts . I had to return both headsets and am still searching for a solution ( maybe bluetooth ) .	-1
I had high expectations for this product given the Sennheiser brand . The charging cradle is very usable and the headphones are a comfortable fit . The device offers 3 transmission frequencies to choose from ( which are public by the way ) . In the office we had issues of two people with similar headphones trying to use the same channel . But the main problem I have had is sound quality and interference with other devices . In the office we have the typical array of other electronic devices . Same thing in my apartment . In both locations the headphones produce a `` wine '' or `` hiss '' noise when the head is oriented at a certain angle relative to the base station . I had this happen at both locations . It is annoying enough that enjoyment of music is consistently degraded . I mailed Sennheiser about the problem and received no response . I have purchased a pair of A2DP bluetooth headphones which are much better sound quality , with no hiss - too bad they do n't have as nice of a recharging station . If you have any other electronics in your listening environment I do n't recommend purchasing the sennheisers .	-1
I never got as far as hooking up the headphones and listening to them , so I ca n't comment on their audio performance . All I know is that within 5 seconds of putting them on my head , they fell off . The ear pads are extremely slippery , and the headphones are very bulky , and the slightest tilt of the head sends them slip-sliding away . What good is good sound if they 're impossible to wear comfortably ?	-1
Could not get this headphone to work at all with my computer . I 'm just writing this last sentence to get to the required length .	-1
My wife has a chronic illness that makes it difficult for her to go to sleep , so she usually watches TV until she drops off . I recently bought a Sony KDF50WE655 HDTV for the bedroom and bought these headphones for her to use so I can get some sleep . They do n't work with the TV regardless of the base station channel selection . Although there is no mention in the Amazon listing for the headphones , the minimal user manual notes that they will not work if connected to some TVs . I tried it with extra long cables to get the transmitter away from the TV but still just static . I have tried it with my iPod and with a stand alone CD/DVD player and it works fine with them .	-1
These headphones , despite the miraculous reviews on here , do n't even work with my TV ! They 're incompatible with the newer TV 's , which do n't offer RCA Audio Output anymore . These headphones are old school , and will not work on the newer model TVs . Complete waste of time & effort for me ordering these headphones . I would n't have liked them anyway , had my TV been compatible . Not worth the $ 64 price tag . They probably cost $ 4 to manufacture .	-1
This is a shame . I bought these because of so many good reviews . They are light weight , the audio quality is good , but none of that matters because I ca n't get a clean signal anywhere.I tried 3 different outlets , 2 which were directly into the wall . At best I get one channel of music and the other `` channel '' of hiss . When I get actual sound ( music ) in both sides ( by adjusting the tune control ) , it 's only one channel , not stereo . They are also not even , either ( one side is n't as loud as the other . ) In addition , they buzz through my amp which is where I really wanted them . I also tried again the next day in yet another outlet and audio system and the same thing happened.Maybe I just got a bad pair , but these are completely useless to me and am sending them back .	-1
Maybe I 'm spoiled . I purchased and returned these headphones almost immediately.The feel of the ear cups are very uncomfortable . They are flat and do not & # 34 ; cup & # 34 ; your ear at all . They literally will fall off your head if you move , turn or look down too fast . That could be overlooked if the quality of the sound was good . Of all the headset/headphones I 've tried , these were among the worst sounding . There was little to no bass at all and for me that was a killer .	-1
not worth a dime . They quit just a few days after the warranty ran out . Do n't waste your money , they are cheap and work cheap .	-1
After several months of using , here are my thoughts : the headphones are VERY warm . Your ears will be kept warm . If you work in a meat locker , this is good . Normal temperatures , not so good . Also , I get a LOT of feedback from them . The base is 3 feet away and up no a shelf , but the static and noise is pretty bad . When I occasionally get a clear signal ( not often ) , the sound is average . They are plugged in to my computer and there is nothing else electronic nearby to cause the issues . Also , after a few seconds of no content ( for example , stopping a streaming radio program ) you get a loud buzz.The range seems to be decent ( 40-50 feet , consistently ) , but quickly fades with walls and windows.I would not recommend these headphones .	-1
I read over reviews on Amazon before pulling the trigger on this set . I really needed it for late night PC use while the gf is asleep . I was really disappointed after the 1st nights use.Pros : - The sound has quality . I do n't have a very trained ear so listening to headphones always sounds good to me.- Very light weight ! Very comfortable to wear.Cons : - Static noise is very apparent . It is setup as my default playback sound on Windows 7 . It is very random but when I turn on my PC the headphones blast off with static ( fixed after spending 30 seconds to tune the headphone ) It is n't very visible , but there is a volume button and a tune button on one side of the headphones . After I tuned correctly , it worked great . I moved 10 ft away from the source , it still sounds very nice , however , small movements of my head would generate static interference . ( There are n't any other electronics between myself and the PC ) - Started to get very annoying to tune the headphones every time I turned on the headphone set and/or PC.Result : Returned this item . Sennheiser 's other RS headphones may be great but this one definitely is not . Using Logitech G930 now .	-1
Positives : Well these are defined as over the ear headphones , one can still pick up other outside sounds and voices due to the porosity of the ear foam pads ( e.g . your wife commenting negatively on the TV show you are watching and being over the ear they allow you to pretend you cant hear ... .a great advantage ) .Once I found the appropriate analog audio output and that manual tuning is required ( see negatives ) setup up was quick.I like the convenience of the volume knob in the earpad.The audio was crisp and clear and there was plenty of dynamic range , in other words I could adjust the volume to an uncomfortably high level well above my normal TV watching volume.It comes with a couple of audio adapters but not a universal set , e.g . no RCA adapters..Negatives : This unit only accepts analog audio inputs ( right and left ) which are becoming scarce on 21st century electronics so make sure you have those available for your application.There are 3 RF channels to choose from to deal with RF interference and those are manually selected and then manually tuned to with a dial on the earphones like an old AM radio . They us FM modulation , circa 60s . This manual nature of the RF interfaces surprised me and is not something I would expect in even 25 year old electronics.After 3 minutes of no audio input ( e.g . turn off TV ) a loud hiss/static commences on the headphones . This means if you leave the headphone off the cradle and turn off the TV the headphone will hiss loudly until the battery dies . The headphone should turn off as well ... .poor design.The charging cradle is a bit awkward to use in that if the earpieces are not set for equal length , then the headphone will tilt to one side and the conductors in the headset band will not sit flat on metal bars ( you can see the bars in the picture ) and the batteries will not charge.The ear pad foam is very light duty and I would not expect them to last 12 months with normal use and wear and tear.There are no RCA adapters included.The charging light stays lit even after charging is complete ! Its awkward to plug in the power adapter . You almost need to used needle nose pliers as there is no room for fingers.On occasion the tuner would detune and I would have to readjust the turning .	-1
The headphones sound great , as one might expect from Sennheiser ; unfortunately , they are very uncomfortable to wear , and do not stay on the head very well . They are also somewhat heavy , so if you tilt them back to get the weight of the band off of the crown of your head , they fall off immediately . There is no horizontal sizing mechanism , so unless your head is somewhat wide , you will not enjoy them .	-1
Having read many of the reviews of the 4 and 5 stars , I thought the one star reviews must have gotten faulty products . So I went ahead and got the headphones . Well , I experienced all the things that are wrong with this product . Namely , that it has an auto-shutoff whenever there is a drop in volume on the TV programs ... giving a very load hissing noice . Thought maybe this would only happen every once in a great while ... so I hung in there because when the headphones are working the sound is very nice . But the shutoff is very frequent and thus too annoying .	-1
I bought this on impulse from Walmart after a good transmitter that I had broke . I had read the bad reviews but got this anyway as it 's all Walmart had and I wanted one right away . It does work but you may have to spend a long time looking for a station and even then you will still probably have some static . For me , it 's been pretty much like listening to an FM radio station in the car where you 're almost out of range of the station and there 's a bit of static jumping in and out but it 's still listenable . I usually use this to listen to a podcast so it might be a little better if I was listening to music . I 've read that the antenna for the thing is in the short audio cable , so using an extension cable might help , but I only really tried that quickely once and it did n't seem to help.As far as battery life , I dunno how strong the batteries it came with were , but I had to replace them after about 4 hours of use I think . I do n't think the auto-on feature really works but I 'm not sure - I always manually turn it on by pressing and holding the up and down buttons ( I probably never waited long enough for the feature to activate ) . The auto-off feature is ok though.It is nice that you can set this to almost any station , including the even numbered decimals ( ie . 90.2 , 90.4 , etc . ) if your radio can tune to those , and you can preset up to four stations in memory - I think the memory is even preserved when the batteries are out but do n't take my word for it . But be aware that while your radio probably goes a little below 88.1 or whatever , this does n't .	-1
I purchased this product because I had been told it was one of the better FM transmitters on the market that does not operate off your car 's cigarette lighter ( and , therefore , can be used both in a car and on a home stereo ) . The price is n't too bad . The problem is it simply did not work . I tried it first of my home stereo and was able to at least get it to produce some sound , but the quality was extremely poor , similar to when you 're driving out of town and losing your radio station - in other words , extreme static . Next , I tried it in the car , where I thought I 'd have better luck , but I could not get the thing to broadcast at all , on any of the available stations . The sound quality was zero , because there was no sound at all . I also agree with another reviewer who stated that the available stations are a problem , as most larger cities will already have these taken . I ended up returning this and going back to my old cassette adapter , which works a thousand times better . I do n't think I 'll ever try another FM transmitter , because after my experience with this one , I do n't think I 'm ever going to find one that works as well as a much cheaper cassette adapter will .	-1
Worked for 6 hours , then just stopped transmitting . What a waste of cash . Do not buy this .	-1
I bought one of these units from Vann 's website because of the price and the good reviews . After having that one plus the replacement they exchanged me for it both have some of the same problems , I decided to look for another unit on this site and found all of these unfavorable reviews . My problems were n't the same as the others . On both my units , if I was watching tv while the vcr was doing a timed recording , when the recording changed to another program I would suddenly loose the tv signal and have to select the channel again and press the tv/vcr button . I talked to a Toshiba rep and he said the the whole manner in which the unit was interacting with the tv was in error . On the first unit , the additional problem was that when playing a tape on the vcr , if I wanted to scan in reverse and see where I am at to find a particular part of the tape , the vcr would cause a flash on the tv screen , the vcr would usually then stop the tape , and I would have to turn off the unit to get the vcr to respond to the remote again . The Toshiba rep claimed these are very good units and that there have been no reports of these problems . However , after this , I ca n't help but be concerned enough to not risk trying one of these units again . I 'm not even sure I 'll try a dvd/vcr combo unit again since I wonder if that is n't part of the problem .	-1
I have had this drive and am extremely dissatisfied with it . It performs far slower than my old Lexar JumpDrive which is only USB 1.1 . I have read the Cruzer titanium is the fastest on the market . Well , after owning the Cruzer micro I can say it must be the slowest on the market.I have tried every type of file system when I format it . I have tried to optimize for performance . And I have tried to copy files large and small . No matter what I do I can not speed up this drive.It does get 1 star though for being so small and having a cool blue light when it is plugged in .	-1
When I first plugged the 512 Cruzer Micro into the front USB 2 port of my PC it locked my PC instantly . No crash , blue screen , etc . Just locked . It worked ok on another PC . I called SanDisk and they said the problem is power . Some USB2 ports ( including the one on the front of my PC connected directly to the motherboard ) do not provide adequate power for the Cruzer Micro . I 've used several other thumbdrives ( of lower capacity ) without a problem with the same port . Maybe it 's the fancy blue LED that sucks the juice ? I have no idea . I got an extension cable ( which SanDisk warned me might not work ! ) and am using one of the rear USB2 ports , which works ok.SLOW : I have n't used any other large capacity USB2 thumbdrives , but from reviews of other drives it seems this one is slow when transferring large numbers of files . ( 500 files 200MB took about 18 minutes ) -- that is writing the files to the drive.It is also extraordinarily slow ( 10 minutes ) to delete those files.I called SanDisk and they recommended reformatting the drive when deleting large numbers of files.That seems dumb to me ( and I have other files I do n't need to delete ... ) Also the MP3 Companion is constructed like something you would buy for $ 5 ( very flimsy plastic switches ) and has a difficult interface . It also does n't work if you have a folder of non-mp3s on your Cruzer.All that said -- The cruzer is small and solidly made . It looks nice and basically functions if your USB2 port has enough power .	-1
At only 15 miles from a few broadcast stations , I expected this antenna would be functional . I received lock on only one station depending on where I stood in the room , for a few seconds . Then it would go out . The strength meter on my tv peaked at `` 15 '' , and the minimum strength recommended for digital reception `` 60 '' .It sounds like this will work if the broadcast tower is right beside you , in which case I suspect a coat hanger would also work .	-1
SUCKS ! ! ! DO NOT BUY IT ! ! ! HD ? Why dun you get yourself a cable ! ! ! Bad Reception ... It does n't stand ... once you extend the antenna , it loses its balance , and tips over ... this sucks ... I threw it away ... looking for something besides this ... This is made in China so it 's very crap ! ! ! DO NOT WASTE MONEY ! ! !	-1
I bought this antenna with great hopes , and would have been happy to just get 1 or 2 stations.However , despite a distance of no more than 8 or 9 miles from the transmitting tower , I get exactly nothing . Not much of a positive investment ...	-1
I bought this antenna at a brick and mortar store before reading reviews . ( Forgive me Amazon ) My building used to have an outdoor antenna , but it quit functioning , so I bought this , thinking it would do a capable job . I was wrong . It was pretty much worthless to me . It requires constant re-adjustment to get a decent picture , then if you change channels , you may have to re-orient it to get a different channel . What a waste of money ! I would never buy anything from Terk anymore . I now have aAntennas Direct Multi Directional HDTV Antennaand it works great .	-1
This antenna worked no better than the cheap portable one that came with my Miglia TVMini HD . Plus , it does not stand up very well because the base is not heavy enought . Pulled in most of my HD stations okay , but I live about 8 miles from the signal . Does n't work at all for lowest VHF channels , and very poor for analog reception .	-1
I thought this was going to be a fantastic product actually . I had red mixed reviews but decided to find out for myself what the hoopla was all about ... and boy did I . It was definitely worse than the rabbit ears I had before ( which I would still have if the antennae had n't broken ) , I could only get about four channels and I was so frustrated I di n't even bother to try and get a refund , but threw it into the trash ... .	-1
I got this to work with my new plasma display , thinking i will get most if not all the HD channels . I got like 5 channels with it and was very disappointed , thinking that I need cable . Then I plugged in my 5 buck rabbit ear antenna just to give it a try , I got like 15+ channels . The only thing I do n't like with the rabbit ear is now , I have to move it around to get certain channels . It would be nice to have some that gets all the channels without moving the antenna around . I also tried an expensive amplified one does n't work at all , even worse than this one . I do n't know if it 'll be better in other areas , but if you 're in boston , do n't bother .	-1
I got no reception with the new system ; even when follwing all instructions . I ca n't recommend this product to friends .	-1
I got these speakers today and they are going back tomorrow . The sound quality is quite nice , but there is always ( ALWAYS ) a hiss sound coming from the two desktop speakers . Even when the line in to the speaker system is actually PLUGGED OUT , even when the volume is set to zero etc.The only solutions are1 . Plug out the two speakers out from the amp box2 . Plug out the AC input wire outAnd you have to do this EVERYTIME you want to silence the hiss ( stepping out , sleeping etc ) ... muting everything etc will NOT work . Imagine now if those wire are behind a table . Even if the wires are accessable , pulling them out i.e . using them as a primitive switch is such an ugly solution ! Plus the noise is always constant . So at low volumes you can actually hear it/get bugged by it . At higher volumes , its simply masked out by the song you play.Another VERY weird thing ... when I plugged in the two desktop speakers in I could hear one particular _FM_ channel ( yes ... _FM_ channel ! ! ) . At the same level as the hiss itself , but I could clearly hear the jockey and songs softly when I mute my volume/plug out the audio in of the speaker system . I have _NO_ idea how the set is able to accidently demodulate an FM signal ( assuming the wires were acting like antennae ) , but if I had n't heard it for myself I 'd not have believed it . It does it , and its a big PAIN . Imagine a car which can never ( NEVER ) stop , u can only change the speed at which you go ahead ! ! Exactly ... weird and worthless ! The bottom line - do NOT waste your money on this . This should n't have even passed the beta stage ( leave alone the commercial market ) 'cos its a massive design flaw . Had expected much more .	-1
I bought this for my fiance , and while it worked , we were both very happy with the size and quality of pictures . But then the day came , less than a year after buying it , that it decided to stop working . Very frustrating , and it seems like we are not the only ones .	-1
Unfortunately , I was one of the morons that purchased this piece of junk . I have had this printer since 12/04 and every time I attempt to use it , something is n't working . I have printed approxmately 20 or so picture in total . This time , the printer will only prints half pictures . I called Kodak and was advised to download their new software . I did that and now the printer wo n't work at all . The lady told me to send the printer in as they have had lots of problems with them . She then asked for my credit card number and that was all she wrote . She tells me they are having trouble with the printers , but I have to pay . I wrote the CEO and no response , so they do n't back their product either . Kodak is in trouble and I wonder why ?	-1
Quirky , expensive and not reliable.Feeds poorly gets stuck and eats paper.The feeder gave out after printing less than 20 pictures.Mine is broke and they said it would cost $ 80 to fix .	-1
I have had this camera for about two weeks and the second time I took the battery out to charge it , the latch broke that holds the battery in place , so I had to ship it back to kodak for repairs ! ! ! The camera review : ( separate from my complaint about the cheap plastic chassis ) This camera takes great indoor shots with good white balance , great skin tones , and vibrant colors and has an ample flash.Having said that , here are the things I do n't like , It does n't come with the charging base or a power cord that plugs directly into the camera so you must take the battery out to charge it and hope the latch that holds the battery in place does n't break off like mine did.The outside shots come out dim most of the time . I tried slowing the shutter speed down and opening up the aperature but most of the pictures I took came out blurry , unless I used the tripod . Sometimes even then as in outdoor shots , most of the time the camera would not acheive focus lock . It would give me the warning symbol tellimg me it could n't lock focus and sure enough , the pictures would come out blurry.No manual focus . This would help when the camera does n't achive focus lock which in my experience was most of the time I was outside.I wish I had more to say and rate this camera on , but it broke after two or three uses and about 2 weeks time.Seriosly folks , my little casio Z4U does a much better job of achieving focus than this camera . Not that it is perfect but I would expect the Kodak to do a better job than my little casio camera any day and in most any way . A very poor performer ! ! ! Experience : Casio Exilim Z4U , Olympus D-580 , Fuji E550 , and the Kodak DX7630	-1
I tried this with Fios ' Cable as the coax in modulating with a DVD ( tried others S-video accessories w/ the same bad result ) . Although the accessories showed up on ch 3 or ch 4 as they should , some other channels did n't work ONLY when the modulated ( DVD ) player was on . The Philips `` tech '' was a waste ( `` we do n't get a lot of calls on PH61159 '' ) but the Fios tech was sympathetic and had a logical explanation -- the PH61159 was interfering with channels & lt ; 7 which were all on the same spectrum as ch 3 & 4 . I guess I need to try a modulator that uses a different spectrum .	-1
I 've had this bag for over 3 years . I guess that is long lasting . The D-rings that hold the strap have been resown several times ( first time was just a few months into owning it ) . While it has several pockets , it is INCREDIBLY front heavy . It will always fall over on its front . The zippered opening has flaps that are much too large . It makes it very difficult to get the laptop in and out . The 2 webbed pockets hold a few things , but something else , higher up , would be useful . Finally the strap . This strap does NOT stay on the shoulder . It 's very uncomfortable , and unless you throw it over your head , is basically useless.So , if you want a bag that 's constantly falling over and has a worthless strap , please buy . Otherwise , buy something else .	-1
I purchased this product after reviewing the positive reviews of others and wish I had not . The case is much too flimsy to prevent damage to the PC and there is virtually no storage space for any accessories . Especially the power supply that bulges on the outside . I would definitely not purchase this product again .	-1
I 've had this player for a year now and it 's a real dud . It 's got a terrible remote pickup , bad menus and worst of all , it resets some of its settings while your watching a DVD . Stay away from this disaster .	-1
I bought this mouse at my local Staples store . After 2 days of use , I gave it to my sister . The most major issue was the lag . There always seemed to be a slight millisecond lag between when you move the mouse and when the cursor moves on the screen . This was n't noticeable until you needed precise movement , like in a game or when photo-editing with Photoshop . I found it impossible to do precise movements . Very dissapointing . This seems to be a problem with most cordless mice . The mouse is also heavier then other mice of this size , due to the 2 AA batteries inside . The only good thing I found was that the wireless system had a distance of like 10 feet . If your just gon na surf the net , or do other mundane tasks on the PC , I guess this mouse will be fine . If you need precise and lightning fast movement , you should pass and stick to corded mice . After giving this one to my sister , I ordered myself a Logitech MX510 .	-1
for the price they are a good value but unfortunately one of the lenses was distorted and i had to send them back . i am unsure at the moment if i am going to reorder the same model or look for an alternative . thanks to amazon for a painless return process .	-1
This kind of battery has a typical capacity of 700-800 mAh . Not even a silver oxide version would get you 4x that capacity .	-1
Do n't buy into the hype the sales people at Big Box stores or Monster feeds you . Folks , there is no need to spend this over inflated price on an HDMI cable.There is an article in NY Times on June 10 , 2009 about how to tweak your HDTV to make it perform at its best . The article specifically advises readers not to be tempted to spend too much on cables . It also quotes industry expert Joe Kane . His advice : `` Cheap cables that cost 75 cents per foot work as well as those that cost $ 100 per foot , '' said Mr. Kane . `` With the latest HDMI cables , if you see a picture and hear the sound , you know it works . ''	-1
The update speed of this camera is horrible . Any movement at all results in a massive blur . Great camera for remote monitoring of potted plants . I returned it for a Logitech , which was at least usable if nowhere near as good as my MacBook 's built-in camera .	-1
This is absolutely the worst piece of high tech equipment I have ever bought . The QA people at NetGear must be shot . The router is full of software bugs . Every single feature is buggy and work inconsistently . It would stop working with no apparent reason and requires reboot almost daily . In a few instances , the only remedy is to wipe out the NVRAM setting and start all over again . Then it will still hang hopelessly a few days later.After honestly trying to make it work for 2-3 months , and updating firmware several times to no avail , I finally gave up and bought a D-link router which works like a charm and took all of 5 minutes to setup.Worst thing is , I bought a $ 200+ USB hard drive to use with this router , and 2 PC Card wirelss adapters . I ended up buying a DLink router and a Buffalo LinkStation . The Netgear driver seems buggy also but after the latest firmware upgrade , the NetGear PCMCIA card started working with my new D-Link router in 108Mpbs mode . My my expensive USB hard drive is now useless since the Linkstation comes with a built-in hard drive . All in all , I lost about $ 350 with this little mis-adventure with Netgear.All in all , the whole package costed me close to $ 500 ( Netgear P.O.S . router , hard drive , and 2 PCMCIA Cards ) . And it is $ 500 down the drain.DO NOT BUY THIS P.O.S. ! This is such a bad experience , I have lost any faith in the brand . Judging by the rest of the reviews here , I am not the only one that suffered .	-1
It 's next to impossible to find a VCR deck only these days . They all come bundled with a DVD player which I already own and do n't need another . So I was happy to see Sylvania still has a single VCR deck for sale . But my joy soon faded as I opened the box and began to plug in all the connections . The picture only shows the front of the deck but if it showed the back you would see there are only 2 RCA connections -- one for video and one for audio . Yes , ONE for audio ! This is advertised as a HiFi and 4 head deck which makes the buyer automatically assume it has stereo output.I went ahead anyway and plugged in everything just to see if I could live with it and was appalled at how horrible the sound really was . Not that it was mono only but it was of really poor quality . I could n't take even 5 minutes of it so I returned the VCR.Do n't waste your money on this deck .	-1
I wrote a review when this palm first came out and I LOVED it . Now that I 've had a chance to use it I 've two complaints that make it unpurchasable for me.The first one , and the reason why you should not buy this product is that the blue paint is CHIPPING OFF ! It 's completely coming off the sides , the front and the back . I can actually touch it with my bare finger and it 'll come off . It 's really embarrassing to walk into a meeting with a paint-peeling palm ! ! ! ! ***as an edit - it 's been about a month and I contacted palm . They replaced my unit for me and so far , so good , but I had to pay for shipping both ways and go 3 weeks without one ! **The second reason , is that while the camera has better resolution , the auto adjust contrast/etc for the Zire 71 was WAYYY better . All of my photos under inside light are coming out bright green , and the photos outside are coming out red and white ! ! I am SO disapointed in palm . I ca n't even resell this stupid thing because of all of the chipped paint - I even bought a hard case to stop this but apparently nothing can . DO N'T BUY IT UNTIL THEY FIX THESE PROBLEMS ! ! Oh , and their support is the worst I 've EVER seen . I had a `` customer service rep '' that was stationed at a call center in India hang up on me , another laughed at me , and the supervisor told me to take the device to the store for a refund ( even thought he knew it was after the store 's warranty ) because `` Palm was n't in the habit of fixing things for consumers '' ! ! ! Be warned !	-1
I bought the Verbatim disks based on the `` 5-star '' rating and positive recommendations . Of the first 4 disks I burned , 3 were unreadable . Caveat emptor .	-1
If you do n't mind blue screens of death or having your PC lockup or reboot after 45 minutes to an hour , this is the product for you . Works fine until it gets warm and then the fun begins.The longest I have been able to stay online is approximately an hour . No wonder they 're selling for $ 15 used on here ... they 're lawn wafers.I had no problems even remotely close to this until I plugged in this turd , so I know it 's the culprit.Back to Best Buy it goes .	-1
This supposedly supports port trunking but I could n't get it to work and it does not support LACP . Speeds were just ok otherwise ...	-1
ITS NOT A GIGABIT SWITCH IS JUST 10/100.NOT RECOMENDED , THE BUILD IS CHEAP , JUST 2 GIGABIT PORTS AND THEY NAME IT GIGABIT ?	-1
I was going to refrain from reviewing this connector . When the second of the two connectors failed , I could not chalk this up to a chance failure . I ordered two of these FlexUSB connectors ... one for use in my vehicle and one for use in my wife 's vehicle . Each was installed in a lighter adapter , in the vehicle , for charging cell phones that sit in RAM brackets just inches from the lighter plugs . The main purpose for their use was to allow a right angle for the cords coming out of our dash lighter plugs . They were not subjected to bending or twisting of the 12 inch cables they supported . The connectors remained in the vehicle and were not subject to removal and movement other than the initial install . The connector in my vehicle broke after only a week of use . The joint cracked and the ball bearings dropped onto the floor and the connector then hung from the lighter adapter by the small ribbon cable . Just this week ( two months ? ) after install , the same thing happened to the second connector . This is a very weakly constructed device and does not hold up to even the lightest of use . I am very disappointed in the quality and can not recommend this product .	-1
What fool measured the PACKAGE instead of the product ? Those of us with netbooks are interested in the measurements if the mouse , not the package !	-1
This CD player is as small as it is physically possible , its diameter just a little larger than the CD itself . The volume controls are tiny , other controls are not obvious by looking at them , and in general , unless you had the manual with you , you would n't know which controls do what . Very poor engineering , but the sound itself is not bad at all .	-1
I have large ears , so maybe I should have expected headphones designed like this to probably not fit . So bottom line ... if you have large ears , do n't get these .	-1
I 've tried more headphones than I care to admit , and these are definitely near the bottom of the list.The plastic ear clips are hard and too large . I have big ears and they fit ok , but anyone else it out of luck.These are not perfect , but they are much better : Sony MDR-J10 h.ear Headphones with Non-Slip Design ( Black ) ( also available in several other colors )	-1
sound is good but does not balance well on my head - is it bad design or is my head shape and size non-standard ? the prob is , until you take it out of the clamshell packaging and try it on , you wo n't know if it will fit you - if it does n't , you ca n't return it to the store ! I bought this model for about $ 24 at J & R ; , the retail store .	-1
Sound quality was ok. Read the reviews here first , and breezed by all of the 'Hurt my ear after a few hours ' . Well , it hurt my ear also . The wife tried it and she said the same . Bought this months ago . Its in a drawer now .	-1
I got this to use with my cell phone ( Motorola Tracfone ) . I did not want to mess with batteries in a bluetooth so I opted for a wired earpiece . Tried to use it once . The volume is too low . When the volume is turned up so you can hear it there is too much static . I have not looked for another yet , but will spend a little more next time and get an earpiece that works . It 's not even worth the effort to return it .	-1
If you purchase a Garmin product , especially this one , you are firmly in the clutches of a Company that gives you what they want you to have , not what you might want . Everything Garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a Garmin . You will be unable to transfer data to Garmin media , you will be insulted by a website either written by or for aliens and should you call the customer service or cartography lines assuming you wish to wait and wait , you will get to talk to people so uninformed about Garmin products your wait was wasted . The dingus works ok with Garmin chips , but the chips are inadequate or incomplete.If you should have a Mac , Garmin leaves you totally unsupported so that if you choose a Garmin you need to buy a PC , a downloader , and Garmin chips to go with Garmin 's vastly overpriced CDs . In short , if you prefer unsupported products that are designed to force you to buy from a company indifferent to their customers , Garmin should be at the top of your list with their GPSMAP 276c .	-1
Replaced an old Gameboy game ( Pokemon silver ) battery , and it started leaking battery acid after 10 minutes . I triple checked and it was the required battery .	-1
I was shocked to see that the battery was totally dead when i got it so i guess you get what you pay for but i was a bit surprised to see a company this big do business like this .	-1
UPDATED REVIEW ( 12/15/2012 ) : This battery died after using it for under 1.5 months . I took a risk with the dirt cheap price and thought I would come out fine . The battery was being used in an exercise heart rate monitor where the original battery had lasted a good 6 or 7 months . Rather displeased this battery died so quickly but it does not seem as painful since it only set me back a little over a buck . Still , beware of short lifespan ! Downgrading the rating to a single star.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I hate going to RadioShack or a big box store to get a single , small item . This battery is priced well , came quickly , and works fine . Not much else to say about a battery !	-1
Normally , the Disney Company only partners with superior companies to produce goods bearing the Disney name or likeness . This is not one of those instances . We purchased the Princess 13 '' TV for our girls for Christmas . The in-laws bought the DVD player . We used the DVD player for less then one week , and it stopped working . I checked the owner 's manual , and there was no mention of the infamous question mark that appeared in the upper right hand corner of the screen . I called MEMOREX , who made this DVD player , and after being on hold for nearly 30 minutes , was told that the progressive scan switch must be on , and to shut it off . I told the agent that I did n't think this DVD player had progressive scan , to which I was told `` All of our DVD players have a progressive scan switch '' . When I got home , I checked , and of course , she was WRONG ! I called again and was told I could either take it back where it was purchased from , or send it to them . I brought it to Sears , and exchanged it . So far ( knock on wood ) , the new one is working fine . It is really cute , and my kids love it . I am just waiting for it to crap out again though .

Did n't work for me . Was connecting to a Linksys WRT54G which works fine with three other wireless devices . When I attached the Hawking adapter to my desktop PC ( Win XP SP2 , pretty standard machine ) , I noticed two things:1 . Speed was slow . No matter how I configured it , I could n't get throughput above 6 mbps.2 . Unacceptable : The adapter kept randomly disconnecting every minute or two . It would reconnect , but it would n't stay connected long enough to do one large file transfer . Unacceptable ! Sorry , Hawking !	-1
the biggest problem is its horribly laggy and incredibly imprecise . no problem on install , though took a couple of tries to get it to pick up the wireless signal -- been fine since then.if you 're using it for moving big stuff around on the screen or clicking in a general area , you 're fine . but to position the cursor right where you want it , you 'll never ever be able to do it with this mouse . it 'll get right up near to the spot you want then as you slow down to try to move it precisely where you want it , the cursor will stop just before the spot then skip over it or jump around , and you 'll never get there . supremely irritating.it has to be moving at some minimum speed before it will even notice that its moving , so slowing down to get more precise just does n't work.also really bothersome is the way the mouse tries to save power by going into sleep mode . if you do n't use it for a little while the optical sensor turns off and only blinks occasionally to check if you 're moving the mouse . when you start moving it again it can take up to 5 seconds before it realizes that you want to move the mouse and wakes up . clicking or pushing buttons does n't wake it up any faster . so you 're sitting there moving the mouse around just waiting for it to kick in so you can click on whatever it was you wanted to click on.this happens all day long , and i already hate mouses so i 'm a heavy keyboard user.i got this to replace my orange microsoft wireless optical mouse model 1008 that broke recently , but before it broke it worked perfectly , very precise , and never any lag - when i wanted to use it it was always just ready.i also have a targus wireless notebook optical mouse and that one also goes to sleep after a short period , but clicking any of the buttons immediately wakes it up , so you get used to scrolling the wheel slightly whenever you go to use it to wake it up.not so with this kensington . get it if you want to be irritated . i am throwing mine in a drawer and buying a different one .	-1
I am used to the ever ready style leather camera cases on my film SLR cameras . This so called case gives no protection except from dust . Save your money and buy an SLR size camera bag instead .	-1
I bought these off ebay on a whim ( they were dirt cheap there ) , but after I got them , I realized why they were so cheap.Pros : * Decent noise cancellation - the background noise is noticably reduced , and the music seems noticably louder* Reasonable batter life - I 've had a AAA cell in there for more than 10 hours , and the battery is still doing fine.Cons : * Very noticable `` white noise '' - a hissing sound when noise cancellation is turned on . This is not noticable when playing music , but quite noticable when in pure noise-cancelling mode . * Bad design - not foldable for storage* Bad design for use on airplanes , since the band goes behind the head ( around the neck ) - makes the headsets ununable if you 've got a pillow under your neck , or are planning to use them lying down anywhere* The headsets do n't work without the battery - even if noise cancellation is switched off* The on-off switch is quite hard to operate - often takes a minute of struggling to turn off or on - due to it being a sliding switch with hardly any grip available to push it either way . * Ears start aching due to the pressure on them within a couple of minutes . * The cord is really short in real terms - at least 2 ' more would have been useful.Bottom line - they 're OK if you got them for a couple of $ s ( like I did off ebay ) , but no way are they worth $ 37 or more that they actually cost .	-1
The sound quality is pretty good -- about the same a earbuds that cost half as much.The headband comfort is not bad , but takes a little getting use to.The ear phones move off of your ear if rest your head on the back of a chair ( or airplane seat ) .If you are looking for noise cancelation you will be very disappointed . There is some but not much .	-1
I am not one of those snobby audiophile people . I do n't use all those silly terms and pretend I can hear some decreased audio quality at sound frequencies only my cat hears . But I do know crap when I hear it . So let 's start off with the most basic function of these ear buds - to deliver decent quality sound to your ears . They fail at that . My crappy $ [ ... ] Sony earbuds and the ones that came with my iPod both sound a lot better . ( Unfortunately for me , the dog chewed up both pairs , which is why I bought the Philips buds to begin with . ) And as for the `` surround sound '' , well come on , you really did n't expect that for $ 15 , did you ? In fact my expectations for ear buds are pretty low . The only criteria they have to meet is A . ) Delivering sound to my ears that 's decent and B . ) Staying comfortably in my ears . That 's it . So how does Philips screw something so simple up ? Besides the sub-par sound quality , let 's look at the other shortfalls : -Ear piece is horribly designed , PERIOD . This alone made these earbuds completely non-functional for me . They wo n't stay in your ears . I get the concept of `` in-ear '' headphones , but Philips does n't . The headphones fall out while you are standing perfectly still . The only time they somewhat stay in is when you spend about five minutes pulling your ear into various configurations to shove them farther in the ear canal - which makes them uncomfortable to wear . Even then , a quick turn of the head in any direction and they are coming out . They were completely unusable for jogging , biking or pretty much anything . The biggest issue is that the earpiece is just way , WAY to big to accommodate a normal adult ear . ( I 'm female , but still , I do n't have particularly small or delicate ears , just averaged-sized ones . ) I got all excited when I saw a second set of earpieces in the case , and then I realized those were even BIGGER . Doh . To give you an idea of how bad these are at staying in , I tried to wear them while riding my Vespa - yeah I know , a bad idea to wear any kind of earphones while on a motorbike , but I digress . Even wearing these with my *very snug* helmet over them , they still fell out ! Next : Stupid features - wish they had spent more time worrying about function than form . Philips spent too much time trying to design features to `` wow '' us , instead of actually making a simple product that functions well . We are talking budget earbuds here , we do n't want bells and whistles , we want something that just works.-The cord for one ear is longer than the other . The idea behind this is that you can put the long one around the back of your head and somehow this is better than the typical Y-style headphone . I found it annoying and the entire length of cord felt too short . The only good thing I can see about this design is that it allows you to differentiate the right and left earbud by touch alone - which is nice when it 's dark . But I mostly just found it annoying.-Stupid case . I do n't get the point of this case . Unlike other ones , where there is a molded area to hold the earbuds , and then you wind the cord around the outside , this is just a stupid floppy piece of rubber over a plastic core . The holes you see in pictures are to hold the alternate earpieces , not the earbuds . You are supposed to wind the earbuds around the core too , so they get all tangled up . Also , the packaging sucks . They knot the crap out of the cord . It seriously took me a good 15 minutes just to unknot the cord and get the stupid things off the spool . What purpose does that serve other than to annoy the crap out of people ? I was all set to return these , and of course , the dog destroyed them . You 'd think I 'd learn after three pairs ? I am most likely going to replace these with the standard iPod earphones . The long cord on those seems a bit odd at first , but I 've come to really like the extra length . And those actually stay in your ears .	-1
This gets one star for 1 ) misleading specifications and 2 ) not doing what it is meant to do.The misleading information is the optical/coaxial interface . It is neither , it 's a 3.5 mm jack . The resolution on the photo is such that it 's impossible to determine this by looking at it . The manual is equally vague . Quite how a piece of solid metal is meant to interface with a beam of light is beyond me . As for not doing what it was meant to , well , I was never able to coax 5.1 out of it . It 's a lightweight and entirely unconvincing piece of hardware , and a big waste of your time .	-1
While the price was/is low , the quality of this item is NOT near the level of the OTHER China made cable from Cables Unlimited . It looks inferior in quality , appears to be a & # 34 ; knock-off & # 34 ; , and is not worth the cost of returning . That said , the delivery was prompt , to the door via UPS . MY bad for not looking further , beyond price . Caveat emptor .	-1
This has to be one of the dumber routers that I have worked with . First , the default IP address is 192.168.0.1 , an address that conflicts with many DSL modems . Several times , my internet connection would go down , and I could not access my DSL modem through the router , even though all was properly connected . I would have to plug my computer directly into the modem , and then into the router to get the connection working again . Many times when this happened , I could not even access the router by typing in the IP address ! Sometimes I would be able to access the `` home page '' but not any other pages . Just recently , the router has been randomly disconnecting for a few seconds , messing up Skype calls and cancelling uploads in process . There are only two possible user names : admin and user , a potential security flaw . Why is this labeled a `` high speed '' router ? There are many gigabit routers around , and 108mbps+ routers exist , so this is `` average speed '' at best . The `` firewall '' is just an afterthougt so dlink could put something else on the box ; it does not compare to say , that of a linksys BESFR51.So with this router down ( I am currently plugged directly into the DSL modem ) , my search goes on for a router that will simply work without complaining .	-1
this router is not worth it . here are my two quirks with it:1 ) i would lose signal once every 2-3 hours2 ) the antenna was so cheaply mounted that it just broke off . i moved the router around quite a bit , but the di-524 's physical structure vulnerability is needless.3 ) the router has very bad ventilation . it gets HOT . my linksys wrt54g is much cooler , and i 've yet to lose signal on it ( had it for about 3 weeks now )	-1
Unfortunately I bought this router ( aka junk ) from Amazon . Never worked smoothly . Did not like WPA . After I set the the protocol to WPA and restarted it , the router froze . Updated firmware , no use . Now its not working . Power is intermittent , will shut off whenever it wants . Freezes randomly . This garbage is going back to Dlink today . Dlink tech support also said that they are having a HUGE number of complaints with 524 especially revision D.I will never buy another Dlink . DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND AVOID DI-524	-1
I have had several years . Always needing to reset . Very poor coverage and connection speed . Today , luckily I was home , the internal wires began to melt . I hurried and unpluged , but think if I was not here , I could have had a fire situation . Now looking at getting a new router . Will not consider this one , again .	-1
Like others here , I found the device relatively unconfigurable . After spending two hours trying to get it to join my WEP encrypted 802.11g network and print I gave up . Went to CompUSA , bought a Linksys single USB printer version , plugged it in and within five minutes was printing . As a consultant , charging a customer for three hours of work when it takes 5 minutes , does not make you look competant.I used the software that came with it , then downloaded all the latest drivers , and firmware , reset the box to default over and over . Iturned off WEP encryptionto isolate whehter it was an encryption imcompatibility -- no help . Tech support is 9-5 M-F so I was outside of any live help . Nothing worked EXACTLY as it was supposed to . This is just a badly designed or flawed product . Maybe some of them out there are better behaved -- in which case we are looking at a poor Q & A ; production value . EIther way it is a crap shoot . The unit got tossed in a box because it was beyond the return policy limit . Maybe one desperate day I 'll pull it out and try to get it to work -- when I have a feww hours to waste.It would have been nice cause I see the possibiilty of a second USB/wireless printer right next to the existing one within a year .	-1
PIECE OF JUNK . DO N'T BUY IT ! I wish I 'd read reviews like the others on amazon.com before buying the LaCie 1TB Bigger Disk Triple Interface FireWire and USB 2.0 Hard Drive ! After purchasing this product from another online merchant , I could never partition the drive as one large 1TB partition -- kept getting errors from Windows XP . Later , files I stored on one of the partitions became unreadable when I tried to access them . Finally , Windows XP 's CHKDSK program could n't even complete a scan of the partition , due to bad sectors.30 minutes on hold with LaCie Tech Support and I learned that not only was LaCie unwilling to make any concessions for a drive that was only 2 months out of warranty , but LaCie could n't even offer a repair service if I wished to have it fixed at my expense ! ... to say nothing of the personal pain of losing hundreds of personal photo files to the drive 's data errors.More info that may help others : The LaCie 1TB Bigger Disk Triple Interface FireWire and USB 2.0 Hard Drive is actually 4 Western Digital Caviar WD2500JB-FUAO IDE disk drives made to appear as one drive via a custom printed circuit board . This whole assembly is then joined via a single IDE interface to a separate board that converts FireWire800 , FireWire400 and/or USB 2.0 to IDE . Whereas the individual disk drives are whisper-quiet , LaCie cools them with a single 40mm Sunon KD1204PFB1 case fan . That fan , itself is supposed to be one of the quitest available , but the whole assembly in its aluminum shell makes quite a racket ! If I wanted to get my unit working again , LaCie Tech Support advised that my only option was to disassemble the unit , myself , test each of the 4 WD drives , independently by connecting them to the IDE interfaces on my computer and replace the defective drive ( s ) , myself at about $ 150 a piece . Whereas I 'm doing all of this , I 'm far from certain that the `` repaired '' unit will be trustworthy -- after all , it 'll still have that circuit board that might be introducing the data errors.Summary : Do n't buy LaCie . Do n't buy external hard disk units that present more than one hard disk as a `` single '' drive !	-1
This remote worked fine until shortly after three months from purchase . One day it simply stopped working without warning . I 've changed batteries and still it will not operate . Stay away from this product .	-1
I find it hard to believe that any of the reviewers who have made positive comments have actually listened to and compared several different sets of portable speakers . If they had , they would tell you to avoid these losers.The sound is tinny , even with the amplifier on . With only .15 watts per channel , you get volume only marginally above that of a typical set of headphones just lying on the table . These might do OK if you put them on the pillow next to your head , but I suspect that you will still be disappointed.Instead , consider the Panasonic RP-SPT70 travel speakers . They are , when folded , only slightly larger than the T33s . They use four AA batteries and have 1 watt of power output per speaker . They also cost about $ 10 less than the Sonys.To be fair , the Sonys DO fit in just about any handbag or briefcase . And they are very solidly constructed . But this does not compensate for the poor sound quality .	-1
What many people do n't realize is that Toshiba switched the innards of this unit somewhere in 2004.The high rating on the review website and CR were based on earlier units built around the Toshiba TC90602FG chipset . Then Toshiba in all their infinite wizdumb decided to completely rework this thing , changing the innards to a whole new setup using the Zoran Vaddis 6 chipset , and continue calling it by the same model number so no one could tell them apart.The Vaddis 6 and variants are the chipsets found in the lowliest of low DVD players like the ones you see for $ 39 at WallyMart et alYou can not put any credence in those old reviews from players tested with the Toshiba chipset . You now know why the reviews are so lopsided . `` I do n't know how you could call this thing bad , it 's wonderful ! '' and `` Are you crazy ? This thing is a pile of doodie ! '' are common on any review site.Given the mid 2004 change date you will are almost assured of getting a Zoran chipset . Avoid .	-1
I ordered this keyboard so I could bring my mouse closer to the front of my body.Pros : - it has good crisp key feedback , and medium-length keystroke . Feels like a cross between a laptop and standard keyboard.- despite its tiny size it has a key arrangement that is fairly similar to standard . In particular , the control key is where it should be at bottom left.Cons : - most glaringly , it without a doubt misses keys ( and I do n't type lightly ) - it also reverses keys when I type too fast . I have confirmed this repeatedly by typing two letters in sequence quickly ; my typing `` accuracy '' due to this has dropped substantially . When I type more slowly it 's OK.- some of the keys are beyond tiny ; perhaps some could be omitted instead . I mean , who needs two Windows keys ? And does anyone actually use the menu key ? I may return this keyboard . Alone while typing this review , I have had to backspace and fix transposed characters repeatedly . I never had this problem with any previous keyboards.Edit : it did not get better , so I am returning it . Too bad ; I liked the form factor.FYI it is made in China , but the box was marked `` RoHS '' ( Not `` RoHS-Compliant ... '' )	-1
i managed to connect this `` adapter '' to my 3 1/2 '' drive , but when i went to place the expanded drive into my 5 1/4 '' bay , it was about 1/4 '' shy . maybe it would work with some other bay , but not mine . useless .	-1
The brackets are small and span only two hole of the 3.5 drive ( adjustable forward to back about 1/4 inch ) . When I put the bracket in the front holes , the drive was too far back and hit the case . When I used the back holes , the drive was too close to my cpu fan and I could not connect the cables .	-1
These are the cheapest hard drive mounting brackets available on Amazon , do yourself a favor and get one of the more sturdy and pricey offerings . You will get what you pay for which is n't much , and the stress of clanking these together into place . And I mean clanking as these clearly are not machined properly .	-1
Though , others may have not had this problem ... the screws that came with the brackets did not match the diameters of the holes of the brackets . I really was not happy about the idea of sending the brackets back ... fortunately I had a package of screws that fit the diameter of the brackets holes that came with the case that I am building . Now , mind you , the screws did match the harddrives holes on the inner sides of the brackets ... but did not match on the outer sides of the brackets that attached to the case . The screws went through the case holes fine but would not thread through the outer sides of the brackets . Also the brackets were not long enough for me to enable the screwless latch feature becoming more and more popular on cases . I would have given it 3 stars had I not had to match another components screws with the brackets ( subtracting 2 stars for not being long enough for screwless latch features and subtracting another 2 stars for not having screws that matched the diameters of the outer sides of the brackets ) . Otherwise , I liked the products ( I ordered 2 ) enough to keep them and not send them back .	-1
This worked fine in windows XP , as long as you did n't try to register more than one login or more than one finger . After that it would go out of control and not let you login except randomly with the first finger registered . No drivers for win7-do n't waste your time .	-1
The driver is very unstable and the softwae crashes on a regular basis . Save your money until APC clean up their act .	-1
Whoever designed this headset stand needs to find another job , it 's an utter failure.For this price , the base needs to offer a normal 2.5mm plug interface . Not worth its price .	-1
Amazon still have these marketed as `` wireless '' under technical information . Do not trust the information Amazon provides . Research separately and read reviews . Several customers were burned on this false claim and Amazon has yet to correct it .	-1
well I bought this cam to match my logitech keyboard and mouse ... well it looked real cool and logitech gave a great description saying how it 's got clear picture and watever.Well the camera has an xxxxtremely grainy picture and to be real the camera isn ; t worth it ... BEWARE	-1
Mediabridge is a lot better . This one never snaps in . As some of the others mentioned ... .very loose fit . I wonder why they made it like that . It works though . But , you move your AV receiver or the DVD player and it falls off . Pretty annoying .	-1
My needs for are not complex enough to require the latest 2011 version of Microsoft Office , so I decided to buy this software to save some money.I was very surprised when I learned that this 2004 can not be used on post-2009 Macs . I found this out when I went to the Genius Bar at Apple and was informed of this fact.I have a 2011 MacBook Pro and if I want to get Microsoft Office , I would have to get the 2011 version . The page for this software is misleading in that it does not clarify this crucial exemption to people who are considering buying it .	-1
I bought two of these ... first one went in the trash ... second has never kept the PC on for more than a few seconds . Belkin support does not have any troubleshooting or information their website . I should NOT have to call `` them '' . I 'm really sorry that Amazon requires at least one star .	-1
I 've had several UPSs now for a while . Belkin UPS quit after about 3 years of work . I understand that this may be long enough , but I have several from APC and they are still working . One UPS , I think , now has been in service 7 or 8 years .	-1
I have had this unit for approximately a year now . For the first 6 mnths it worked fine . After that time period we would be watching a dvd movie and half way through the picture will go black , but you could still here the sound . If we rebooted the system , and jump scenes to where the trouble began , it would generally resume and work fine . Over the past couple of months this occurs 3 to 4 times each movie . When we finally get too frustrated and take the same disk to the back of the house and put it in our cheapo GE player ... it plays fine . I would not waste my money on this product .	-1
This , and all Toshiba brand DVD recorders contain provisions that prevent you from copying any materials that contain a copy protection prevention signal from the premium cable services .	-1
I 've had and used the RadioShark for about a month now ( I make daily recordings ) .Like many other users here , my RadioShark appears to suffer bad reception . I record mainly AM stations , and I 'm recording a very powerful AM station in San Francisco -- and I live in Oakland ( 10 miles away ) . Reception SHOULD be flawless ( as it is on every other AM radio I own ) .The problem I experience , however MAY not be a reception problem . To me , it sounds more like a recording level problem . It 's as though the signal is overdriven , and distorts . I say this , because any `` quiet '' sections record relatively well . It 's when loud commercials with lots of background music come on that the recording gets badly distorted.I have not yet tried to discuss this issue with Griffin tech support -- but intend to -- to see what they say . ( 4/4/05 Update : I 've explained my problems to tech support , and they 're mailing me out a replacement unit -- we 'll see if this correects the problem ... ) Otherwise it has all worked well . I did have a couple of schedule recording failures , but discovered that when I did n't plug the USB connection into a USB hub , but plugged it directly into a USB connection on the computer ( this is a Win XP box ) , my failed recording problem went away.I have no problem with my monitor sleeping -- does n't adversely affect anything .	-1
All in all , if you live in a big city with plenty of radio stations to choose from you will probably find the Radio Shark quite useful . However , for those of us who live in the suburbs and wish decent radio reception , this is not a `` Silver Bullet '' . It seems pretty well shielded from computer noise , especially on AM . The slider tuner is very difficult to use and the channel scan feature does not always lock on to a station . If you know the frequency of the station you wish to listen , it is much easier to type it in , instead of trying to slide to it . There is a jack in the back of the shark for what seems to be head phones , but manual leaves out any reference to it . After reading several blurbs about the Shark , this jack was alluded to as also a place for an external antenna . How the user is supposed to utilize it is a mystery so far . Manual and web site more tuned toward time shifting and recording Q & A , but with very little to listen to , is there really a need to time shift or record ? Make sure you download the most current version of the software and do not rely on the auto update feature , which did not work for me 'twice ' .	-1
Sound quality from AM that is so tinny it hurts your ears and a buggy interface that causes crashes and features that do n't do what they are supposed to.And do n't let the idea that a simple software/driver update will fix the problems ; The latest software version available from the manufacturer 's website is actually WORSE and has had some features REMOVED.STEER CLEAR !	-1
I bought this gadget in the hope of recording off-hour radio broadcasts and be able to hear them on my mp3 player later.The problem with the device is its software : it has a significant memory and CPU footprint while running ( as a service process , which means all the time ! ) . And it almost always crashes when woken by the scheduler for the 2nd time.Furthermore , it records in iPod 's format , to convert it to MP3 can literally stop my desktop . Nor does the software allow you to create a separate folder for each recorded program . The reception is meager to say the best . But unlike my tuner , I ca n't even attach a UHF antenna to it.Not recommended .	-1
An avid D-Link fan I am . Their routers and Wi-Fi equipment are top notch . But the DSM-320 is not as good as I expected . In fact I think it is quite bad . My bet is that you would be dissatisfied with it and return it ( as I did ) . Especially if you have a large amount of music and especially if it is Classical music . After having numerous problems finding a proper location in my house ( I experienced a lot of drop-outs ) I finally found one but it did not at all agree with where I really wanted it placed . The reception capability is weak and is definitely going to cause you a problem unless your computer is in the same room as the MediaLounge ( God forbid ! ) . Now , I have meticulously given my mp3 files proper names , artists , etc . We all know that the tags are often wrong especially on older recordings . But the darn MediaLounge uses the tags to display the music rather than the file name so it becomes a real mess . And , the real killer is - the unit can not display enough characters to allow me to see which movement of a particular piece of music is being played as such information typically is truncated due to the number of character limitation ! Enough is enough so I decided to return it despite the expense of paying for re-stocking and return freight . But before I returned it I wrote to D-Link about my experience . They did not bother to answer or offer any encouraging news about updates or anything . Save yourself the agony and wait until something better comes around and be sure to check that whatever new comes out does not have the same limitations and weaknesses I mentioned above .	-1
Installation was very difficult . Printed documents poor . On-line documents not much better . I learned the most from someone 's review . A call to the vendor was very helpful . After I finally ( 6 hours ) got it set up , I found that music buffered in mid-song . ( Not quite what I was expecting . ) My router was less than 20 feet way from the unit on the other side of two sheet rock walls . So I should n't have this kind of problem . I returned the unit to Amazon . BTW , Amazon was great - very prompt with the refund .	-1
The feature that originally sold me on the DSM-320 was its support for the XviD and DivX formats . These , however , are the two formats that are supported the least , and a slow , jerky , framerate should be expected . I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue , and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable , the framerate improved , but not enough , in my opinion , for this device to even claim support for these file types . If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you , be warned , you should look elsewhere .	-1
I have never been a big fan of companies sending a product to market and consumers being the beta testers . I think that is the case with this device . We are beta testing the item but with the full purchase price . I like the concept . I really like the Radio @ AOL feature ( which is why I purchased it ) . The issues at hand for me:1. wireless connection doen not maintain2 . plays only a single mp3 file ( not album ) unless you create a playlist manually ( c'mon , be real ! ) 3 . slide show does not work as described4 . screen saver does not kick in while platin the Radio @ AOLThe two stars are for & quot ; upside & quot ; , but this is like drafting a high school star into the NBA ... .it might work out but there is tremendous & quot ; upside & quot ; . Unfortuanely we all know how many & quot ; busts & quot ; there have been.The product should not have been released until it was ready and this was a faux pas by someone in marketing for D-Link . Hopefully the firmware fixed will come fast and furious to help us all out . Otherwise I will need to buy an access point and hard wire into the device and avoud the wireless component altogether .	-1
The server software really stinks . I 'll say it agian , the server software really stinks . The remote is slow , small and really stinks.The only reason for the two stars is the fact the I got the unit up and running in short order ... .. It then took several hours of additional work to get the video portion of the unit working.After fighting with this thing all weekend long , I gave up on the unit Sunday and took it back .	-1
After reading all the wonderful reviews of this product it seemed to be perfect to store and use for my small home network instead of the other three computers getting data from my main computer . I had hoped it would be as easy and as lighting fast as I had read . It was not , not even close . Tech support is poor ; performance of this product is extremely poor . It would take my other computers about 20-25 seconds to access the main database I use , now with this Netdisk it is at least 58 second or more . Even accessing the data the performance is sluggish and in no way worth the money spent . Tech support said I had an old driver . I installed the new driver with no change . Do not invest any money in this product if speed is what you want .	-1
Hinges fall off , causing the case to separate . Very disappointed in the quality of these cases . Bought 100 of them .	-1
You 're supposed to be able to crimp these to the ends of your speaker wires . Trouble is , the metal is so brittle that it cracks during crimping , The wires wo n't hold and the whole thing falls apart . I bought 5 packs and had to throw them all away . Do n't waste your money . Spend a few more bucks for the twist on banana plugs .	-1
It does not work its a dud ! ! ! My drive at least showed up w/the old cable but with this new one theres nothing .	-1
Ever since Monster decided to mass-market everything that they possibly could , their quality has been steadily declining . This product does n't even live up to what I expect from a budget brand.The transmission strength seems very low , it seems very hard for the car 's radio to lock onto the signal . Even after managing to get the car 's stereo to tune in properly , there is considerable hiss and distortion . In addition to that , the sound level is very low , so you need to crank your car stereo volume way up , which only amplifies the background hiss and distortions more.I replaced with with a Belkin Tunecast II . The signal from it is clearer ( almost as clear as a regular broadcast radio station ) , stronger , and louder . All around a better device .	-1
According to Ritek 's site , they are working on getting a full 8X out of Pioneer 's DVR-107D and DVR-A07XLA , but they are not there yet . I 'm disappointed because I did n't consult their site before buying them and expecting to write at 8X with my Pioneer drive.One would easily assume that a DVD writer , with a big fat 8X on the box ( running the latest firmware and software ) , and media with that same fat 8X on the wrapper would be able to write at 8X , but guess what ? Not true !	-1
My prior batches of Ridata DVD+RW 's from Amazon used to be pretty good . My most recent order has been pretty bad - of the 25 discs , about 5 of them are now unreadable and have visible spots underneath ! Other users also seem to be reporting this ( on DVD+R batches as well ) - I do n't know if this is isolated to Amazon 's supply , but be aware.Update Sept6 , 2005 : Now MORE of the discs are starting to get spots ! I 'm not sure what is happening . I am going to contat Ritek to see what they can do about it . Until then , I 'd recommend avoiding this batch of DVD+RW 's .	-1
This is the worst Sony headphones I have even come across , they have too much of static and basically waste of time , I have 4 other type of Sony headphones and never had any problems whatsoever , these are crap and not worth $ 5/- + they do n't even deserve the 1 star .	-1
I thought Sony always makes the best electronics . This headphone proved my notion wrong.The sound quality is awfully bad . I get lot of noise and distortion even at 6 ft distance within line of sight.The phones have no treble or bass . Its good only for TV audio.The battery life is ok . But the battery started losing its charge after going through 10 to 11 charging cycles . Now , after an year , they do n't even last for 10 minutes of charge . I do n't want to buy an expensive battery for these waste of money headphones.Never ever buy this product .	-1
re : Sony MDR-RF960RK headphonesI recently ordered the above product for my parents for private television listening . This product was so grossly defective in design and performance that I returned it for full refund immediately.I am a professional audio engineer with extensive RF experience so this is not a case of user error . Interference noise in the form of high frequence audio tones ( of which the manual advised ) is so objectionable that my 80 year old parents could hear it plainly . The so-called 'noise filter ' switch attenuated the wanted audio and the unwanted noise equally so that the needed volume compensation brought back the noise full force . The audio input circuit has such poor dynamic range that adding input level in an attempt to overwhelm the noise resulted in unlistenable compressor pumping and distortion . Absolutely unusable.I find it hard to believe than Sony , with their history of outstanding professional broadcast audio equipment , would actually produce and sell such a low quality product . Though I proudly own and use many of their professional products , I am sorry to say this product will keep me from taking the chance on any Sony consumer wireless in the future .	-1
After using the charger for about 2 weeks I started noticing drops in the power feeding to the iBook . After about 2 months the charger stopped working altogether . On inspection I noticed that the metal part of the plug was separating from the plastic part and I suspect this is causing the disconnect . MacAlly has no warranty information on their web site and I called them several times only to be diverted to a messaging system and I never got a callback.I 'd say avoid if you can .	-1
Maybe it was only the unit I had , but this unit had horrible color reproduction - specifically , black level and contrast . I tried the DVD player 's adjustments and my TV and just could not get a good picture . Very disappointed . My prior 480i DVD player had much better picture quality and I actually went back to it . The menus on this player are also cheesy Atari 2600 quality blocky graphics . Otherwise , it had all functions expected of a DVD player and the DiVX stuff was nice too .	-1
I bought this player in November 2005 and it stopped working a few days ago . I called Philips customer service and they informed me that it is beyond the warranty period and there 's nothing I can do . I expected a $ 60 DVD player to last more than a year . My next one wo n't be made by Philips .	-1
Mine also stop working after a year or so..the stand by light just blinking and no response . Do n't buy this product ! !	-1
PC 's and xbox connectivity to windows media make this thing useless and philips reliability is abismal . Every product I own from them has failed or been a letdown .	-1
I collect AM radios and was anxious to add this cute Sony to my collection . Had I not wanted to actually USE it , it would be fine . I like to listen to my radios in bed late at night and I do n't want to disturb my mate . I hold the radio right up to my ear and listen at the lowest possible volume . This radio has no low volume ! Ths on/off switch/volume control goes from zero to 50 - nothing in between ! No low volumes are available . It 's a defective control but who in the world is going to seek a repair or even a refund on a $ 10 item . If listening at very low volumes and a nice smooth , linear control are important to you ... SKIP this poorly made radio . It is not worthy of the Sony name .	-1
This product is huge ! There is no way the cheapness justifies its size . In addition , it does n't get all the radio stations . How ridiculous is that ? !	-1
bought it from Amazon . Also bought a sony earphone . The speaker is quite good . However , when I plugged in the earphone into jack , only left side has voice . I thought the problem is with the earphone , then tried other 3 earphones which I have been using on my iPod and other radio , same problem.Called Sony support and they agree to let me send back the unit and they will ship a brand new one . However , I have to pay the one way shipping for this $ 10 unit !	-1
This is the worse filter I have ever used . It is not coated with the light reflects and refracts so easily . Not suitalbe for use as anything except as a coaster .	-1
I like the idea of this product , but it is just not executed well . I consider myself intermediate/advanced in home computing/networking and I had the hardest time getting this to work . I did have to directly plug it in to my existing wireless router to configure it and it seemed to do the trick . I would skip over the auto detect as it never seemed to work/stick . Hopefully something better will come along ... : /UPDATE May 2009 - I still have not gotten it to work consistently - so I would have to say skip it .	-1
As far as I can tell it 's easier to move to a smaller house than get this thing working . Perhaps I was on a non-starter as I have the WAG54G which is n't on the very short list of linksys kit that the box says it `` also works with '' . Additionally the box says `` works with most routers '' , which you 'd think included most of Linksys ' own routers . Not , apparently the WAG54G . If you have the WAG54G , do n't buy this thing , you will have no joy . It will simply stop your network functioning and if you do plug it in via ethernet to your WAG54G it will cripple it with IP conflicts . So do n't buy it . Move , it 's easier .	-1
I have been using this since 2009 to extend my network at home . The setup was not too bad . It works okay , but I notice that it seems to get confused when multiple devices are within range . This extender will just crap out when it sees contention from multiple devices . It usually happens when I boot up a new device or shut down a device within range . Once this happens then any device which was using the extender without an issue and still running will become disconnected from the network . I get the limited or no network access message . So then I have to go over to the extender and unplug it then plug it immediately back in and then my device will work again . I unplug and plug this extender anywhere between 2 - 8 times a day due to other devices coming into range and booting up or shutting down . For some reason the insides of this thing just get all messed up when this happens.Here is an example . My home computer is using this extender in the far bedroom of my house . I am using the home computer fine . I decide to turn on the wifi on my smart phone ... . Boom ! My home computer now has limited or no internet connectivity . Unplug , plug , network extender and ... . home PC reconnected ... now I have network connectivity again . Oh , I decide now to turn off the wifi on my smartphone ... Boom ! My home computer now again has limited or no internet connectivity . Repeat as needed.I do n't recommend this device .	-1
If your wireless network is using WPA2 encryption , this product does not support it . You will have to use the less secure WPA or the insecure WEP encryption option . Despite the fact that Linksys ( owned by Cisco ) has had firmware updates for its WRT54G router to support WPA2 since at least August 2005 , it still has not bothered to update this product . The one I bought was version 3 , the current one being sold.Also , as many others have said , setup instructions are very poor , so be prepared to spend time with Tech Support . It took over half an hour on the phone for the tech rep to figure out that the problem was that the product does not work with WPA2 despite my telling her my configuration at the beginning of the call . She had to check with a supervisor twice to finally discover the problem . The support rep was very courteous but obviously did not know the product well enough and should have escalated the call to someone more knowledgeable.In general , Linksys products have been great , but this one is a loser .	-1
3 hours trying to install . Two calls to Linksys ' 800 number . Finally , gave up . Interesting additional annoyance . When I run setup , my laptop never sees the Expander , but to really stick it to me , it prevents my laptop from using the wireless router at all - even after I disconnect the Expander . Does n't work by wireless or cable connect . Recycled power , played around with settings , nothing seemed to work . Finally , hit the right combination and now at least I can use the router again .	-1
I 've always had good luck with Maxell DVD media . This time what I received was something titled MaxData Maxell DVD+r 's and so far over half of what I have tried to use has failed in both stand-alone DVD recorders and on my PC 's . Absolute junk .	-1
this is the worst dvd/vcr player i have ever had and seen ... after couple of months it is not working even though it is `` sony '' Dont buy it you will be very dissapointed ... P.S 1 Star because i couldnt vote for less..	-1
I have owned this unit for nearly two years , have called customer support several times ( they are friendly and fairly knowledgeable ) and have never been able to use TV Guide listings because of an apparent incompatibility with Comcast 's signal and this unit . Now , I can `` rent '' a DVR unit from Comcast that DOES work with their TV Guide signal ( a Panasonic even ! ) but I dislike the idea of getting rid of this unit after investing a decent amount of $ $ into it . If it were n't for this major problem , I 'd be very happy with the unit .	-1
I , too , have had many problems with this unit since it was purchased in January 2005 . I 've called Panasonic so many times that I do n't even bother any more because the wait is so long and they are absolutely no help and sometimes even rude . They ask the same questions over and over until I actually start feeling intimidated . They assume everything that you report is YOUR error , not the recorder 's . Now the U99 message pops up randomly and resetting according to the Owner 's Manual does no good - it just happens again , so we never get any listings . Panasonic did refer me to a `` local '' dealer for repair , but the `` local '' dealer happens to be over 100 miles away . Big help . Buy another recorder .	-1
I already had the network and I would say although I 'm not brilliant , I am pretty computer savy . Forget this thing . It 's so frustrating because it 's such a great idea . I actually had it up and running for a weekend . I kept getting `` download error '' when I tried upgrading the firmware ( on THREE computers ! ) . But it worked OK without the upgrade . I told myself I could live without playlists ... ..But now more than 90 % of the time I get `` Rhapsody is being accessed by another program '' . Does n't matter how many times I power cycle the computer and Rhapsody . Or I get my other Fave `` file format error '' . It 's really too bad - I had such high hopes for this .	-1
What a waste of space . Restricted channels , very poorly supported by its Indian customer ( non ) 'service ' center . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ... unless you 'd like to try doing anything with mine ! ! ! I am a Linksys devotee , but this is a terrible try at making something work.Always want you to upload firmware and then retry ... horrible . It works if you only want the stations that are already in the system.Sounds OK though.There are much better solutions out there .	-1
I am very disappointed with this product . Good thing I was a DJ for many years because I have knowledge of running wires all over the place ! I actually laughed when I had all of the wires in place on this unit ; the back looked like I had just assembled an entire entertainment center ! On top of all that , you have to read the instructions very carefully , oh and make sure you find that silly switch to flip ( which is not easy ) before you hook it up via ethernet cable for the initial installation . Bottom line , you need to jump through too many hoops to get this thing to sing for you . Good Luck !	-1
When you have two things , whether speakers or headphones , plugged in to this the overall volume is greatly decreased . In some cases this makes things too quite when at max volume.I unplugged my computer speakers and had just the headphones attached and I noticed that my left ear was quieter than my right . When I plug the headphones straight into the computer the volume issue was gone.Do not buy this .	-1
Price was too good to be true . The glue failed and the shrouding/cone came apart from the metal gate . .	-1
The magnet on these are so small they produce absolutely no bass ! ! I started to install these on my ice chest radio and then I heard them play . I would not use these for anything , sorry . The Big Problem is that they are not even 2 '' deep . Small magnet = low quality sound .	-1
Cheap Chinese junk . One blew within two days even with me being very careful to keep the volume at a conservative level . Spend more money and get a decent set to save yourself from more work .	-1
Installed these right overhead in a 34 ' RV , could barely hear over Road noise , would not recommend if you want volume or base .	-1
i installed it , two days later i found one speaker vibrates , make buzz sounder , then i ordered a replacement , on the same day the replacement come to my home , then the other speaker started to vibrate too , as result , i refused to accept the replacement , i hate to reinstall another pair of speakers after all the melting job is done , i ordered a pair of sony speakers , hope they will be good .	-1
when i see the sub i dont even want to try to hook it up , , , look at the back of the sub its pathetic .	-1

I bought the Logitech Cordless Desktop at Target set because I felt it would be nice to have a Keyboard and Mouse that do not tug if I get tangled wires . It is nice , after all . However , I found that this set is definately not the way to go if you play games or have any program where you may need to hold the moues button.After returning two of these sets already , the mouse seems fine after 5 days , but it soon starts to squeek louder and louder after you hold down the buttons . ( Such as controlling your character on World of Warcraft , as in my case . ) The noise is tolerable at first , but you find yourself soon surfing the internet and having this horrible mouse screach at you every time you click everywhere . While I am typing this review on this terrible product , I am taking this back tommorow and getting the Microsoft cordless keyboard and mouse set ... $ 20 more , but you get what you pay for.I recommend a different product , or better yet , a completely different brand altogether . Logitech has let me down horribly .	-1
I purchased this item based on the idea of having a PC card that would not stick out like a sore thumb . I 've been using a Linksys 54G card that works great but I always knock off the end cover when I slip it into my computer bag.After installing and using for a couple of weeks I decided to ditch this thing . The reception is worse than bad . The ability for it to keep a connection is also substandard . I/O should offer all of it 's customers a refund or offer some kind of fix.Unfortunately I sent in the rebate form and now I 'll have to wait 10-12 weeks for a check.If your familiar with 802.g or are new to wireless networks save yourself the aggrevation and purchase something else .	-1
I really recommend you to go and find something else . This is not something good to use . I bought it myself and just wasted money . You can , of course , try it yourself and tell us your story but to me it did n't work well .	-1
The main photograph with the write up shows the 33120 in a round black base . The base is n't included . What you get is shown in the second picture , just the light on a short gooseneck arm and a USB connector .	-1
I was hoping this light would be what I was looking for but it was not . The USB plug does not fit tightly and moves around a lot which caused my light to go on and off . The shaft is not very good and I found that if will start moving down shortly after it is set were I wanted it . I was goit wouldng to send it back but the return shipping cost and the time it would take go to UPS or the post office it 's just not worth it . I 'll find a way to make it work . I have some scrap wood in my shop so I 'll try and make a stand for it .	-1
This item is not bright enough and does not stay put , but falls to keyboard .	-1
I was initially impressed by the bass quality I got from this sub-woofer.I hooked it up to a low end low power amp and it was good for maybe 2 months then I noticed the sound became distorted.Something obviously broke loose inside and sounds like a typical speaker with tear in the cone , although I do n't see one.Definitely not worth it .	-1
I 've been using versions of this kind of thing since I found them ( search `` power liberator '' ) years ago . This is the simplest version ( as oppose to a `` Y '' one that power two devices ) , and to charge almost $ 12 for it is ridiculous.Sometimes Cable To Go produces things that justify a high cost , but there is nothing about this product that does so .	-1
it was EXTREEMLY bright & # 60 ; 3 which was goodbut then 2 hours later of used it just died.but fan still workstho loud and i do n't mind.recommended for being usefulbut 1 star for poor led lights .	-1
This is a fancy item , pretty strong air flow created by it . However , it only accelerate the air circulation inside your desktop box , not helpful for heat exchange to the outside . It also creates high frequency noise ...	-1
Product only works with very very short cables . Too much signal loss with cables longer than 2.5ft . Was not able to use the adapter sucessfully . Also will not work as a combiner unless 1 of the inputs is completely off , and of course the cables are very very short .	-1
I do n't like writing negative reviews but after a lot of frustration with this product it 's time.First of all , it can work and when it does , well , it 's digital , you get two Toslink outs from one in ... ... if it works.I bought three of these , one worked some of the time , the other two did not pass signal . I tried several different cables , some by Hosa , some by Best Buy , some from Amazon , I got flakey results from all of them . As I said , it can work and when it does , great , but without warning it will quit working and worse , can cause static sounding noise when it goes flakey . The single input hole seems to have a little flex to it and that is probably keeping the input fibre from seating properly ( just my guess ) .Some fibre cables are very hard to disconnect from this thing , I had to use pliars to unplug Hosa fibre cables , talk about a tight fit.I ended up buying a much more expensive active , 4 in by 2 out Toslink matrix distribution box to meet our Toslink splitting needs , I got it here on Amazon and it works great , very reliable.Good luck to all .	-1
It worked a couple of times with a lot of fiddling . Svideo plug is too large to fit well in my Toshiba laptop . Not worth the hassle , buy a Roku , get the Plex media center app and server software , and play movies over wifi .	-1
Nothing wrong with the product or the seller.I purchased this knowing that my laptop Dell Vostro had a 7-pin S-video out . However , research on the internet said that 4-pin would work on the 7-pin . So I bought this 4 pin , received it promptly from seller , and tried it out.Audio worked fine , but video did not work.I tried a different HP laptop , which had a 4-pin S-video out . Video and audio did work , but the display on TV screen was black and white.My TV has a S-video input , but it 's in the back . The RCA plugs were in front , that 's why I went with S-video to RCA . Going to buy different cables , 7-pin S-video out to 4-pin S-video in , and hopefully that works.It could just be my TV , and that I should have used S-video to S-video cable in the first place .	-1
We were sent the wrong cord . It is not anything like what is pictured . This cord sent is useless to us . we are returning it .	-1
As already mentioned by another reviewer , this RAM is NOT CAS 2.5 , but CAS 3 ( 3-3-3-8 according to SPD ) . Running on my electronics lab computer , an Opteron 185 w/2GB Geil RAM and a Sapphire Radeon 3850 AGP , the RAM worked fine for less than 24 hours before it started causing lockups , requiring a hard reset . Since the RAM that was already in there has relaxed timings compared to this RAM ( 3-4-4-8 ) , the only excuse for this failure is poor quality control at Corsair.After the failures , I ran these through a series of Memtest86+ runs , and both failed at their rated timings in less than 20 minutes.I 've purchased Corsair RAM 3 times now . The first RAM is still going strong , but the last two sets were both defective . Corsair will never again see a dollar from me .	-1
Dear Emperor ! This is so loud . SO LOUD . No single audio file does this justice : The Tornado is the loudest fan I 've ever had the displeasure of using.If you keep this like , on a separate floor , than where you intend to be most of the time , then go for it . Otherwise , STAY AWAY.So loud .	-1
I bought these binocs because of the price and realized I should have spent the extra money . The low to mid magnification is good to fair , but the full zoom is out of focus and creates double vision and a headache . Maybe I just got a defective pair , but I 'm not gon na give them a second chance . I 'm going to spend the extra money and get a pair of Oberwerks .	-1
Where it attaches to the EOS , there 's a small pin that extends from the camera into a slot on this device . However , the slot is not the right size , and while there is a slight click as the pin tries to seat , it does not lock . The camera , can come free from the adapter w/o pressing the release button . You could spin the camera free by just an unfortunate bump !	-1
Not easy to use . whats the use of wireless if you have to stay in front of the transmitter , for it to work .	-1
These work fine as remote speakers when listening to music . The problem comes when using them as surround rear speakers with home theater . There is a timer on the transmitter that cuts off the power automatically after a minute or so of low or no signal - a frequent occurence in movies . Pop - off they go and they wo n't come back up unless you crank the volume and even then not for awhile . Theres nothing you can do to make them work . However , I returned them and replaced them with Amphony wireless model 1550 which uses existing unpowered speakers . the 1550 comes with two 50 amp wireless amps that need plugging in and hook up to your speakers using regular speaker wire . At first , I encountered the same problem but with some tweaking found that the transmitter would n't cut off if you turn the signal all the way up on it and use the controls on the H. Theater system to turn up the gain on the surround outputs to +10db - that 's the trick . You then turn the volume down on the remote amps until you get the desired surround volume . Viola ! Quality , noise free wireless sound with plenty of power @ 50 amps . [ ... ]	-1
These speakers are way overrated . ( 1 ) They are huge , full bookshelf size . ( 2 ) The sound quality was terrible . The manual says that it works best for output that is at a constant level . That is fine for a standard TV , but receivers and DVD players do n't output at a constant level . ( 3 ) The speakers have a blue light on their front that shows that the speakers are tuned in to the transmitter . The light is very large and is distracting.I was very disappointed . The speakers are on their way back for a refund .	-1
Mine died a few weeks ago , and I replaced it with a Logitech UltraX keyboard . It is a 100 % improvement over this Kensington model . The UltraX feels more solid , is even more responsive , has a standard layout , looks more sophisticated , and has no driver problems.Pros : - Keys have a very nice feel to them . Not as good as many laptops , but still a huge improvement over a regular desktop keyboard.- It 's much easier to type very fast on these scissor-switch keyboards.- The media ( play/pause , volume up/down ) keys are handy.Cons : - Problems with the USB driver . At unpredictable intervals , one key press will result in ~30 repetitions of that key . You have to backspace through them , unless the backspace key was that one that stuck , forcing you to retype most of your last sentence again.- Chrome-colored paint accents wear off very quickly , leaving an ugly greenish-grey color.- The keys tend to stick after a while . They feel 10 % engaged and you have to poke them a little to unstick them.- The nonstandard layout is a little annoying at times . I never got used to the pgup/pgdn positions.- The Cadillac comparison made by other reviewers sounds perfect to me . Too much flash , chrome , and cheap materials and not enough quality.- Mine lasted less than 18 months . Unacceptable when paying $ 30 for a keyboard alone .	-1
I ordered the AR wireless speaker and headphone combination . They were shipped separately . The headphones arrived first and work as desired . Today the speaker came . I set it up according to the directions and by chance selected the same channel the headphones were on . The XMradio , which the headphone transmitter was attached to , immediately came through the wireless speaker . I am debating whether or not to order another speaker to get stereo . The quality is as expected from a plastic bucket , as another reviewer called it . To be used as a weather-proof outdoor speaker it will perform as expected . I am completely satisfied , but can only give a 4 as I 'm not over-whelmed with having to use 8 size C batteries with it.Edit - the speaker went south . It no longer works and is thrown away . I would not buy another . I now would give it less than a one star if I could change it .	-1
This was exactly what I needed . It is very adjustable , and feels solid and well made . The suction cup also holds very firm on the glass , a big plus since most window-mount devices like this constantly fall off . Unfortunately , after about a month , the adapter broke off , right behind the plate at the swivel . I was adjusting the swivel , while it was attached to the window , so there is no way that I put that much pressure on it , but it just snapped off in my hand . I looked at it pretty closely , and I could n't see any defects that could have contributed to it breaking , it must be just the poor quality of the plastic or molding process.Were it not for the seemingly poor quality , this mount would have easily gotten 4 or 5 stars from me . Great design , but it 's just not up to the quality of previous Arkon mounts I have owned . The only way it gets 2 stars from me is that I was able to patch it with Gorilla Glue and it is still functional . Gorilla Glue gets 5 stars .	-1
I have a 2 units of the 995 and the RX65- all high end detectors from Beltronics . Got all three within a year time span and after 1.5-2years , they start saying `` Service required '' calibration issue . Looks like this a common problem with their high end detectors . Had to send 2 of the units in for repair and my last unit went out with the same problem.The detectors work great when they dont have this issue .	-1
( 1 ) The clock loses one minute per week , so you do n't have the sit through the unrecorded beginnings of TV shows . ( 2 ) It records disks that inexplicably freeze-frame and jump forward when fast-forwarded on playback . ( DVDs recorded on a different DVD Recorder behave normally . ) ( 3 ) Nine months following purchase , any new attempt to record a DVD instead display a `` DISC ERR '' message . This last feature relieves the user from wasted hours spent watching recorded shows when he could better spend his time writing this acerbic product review .	-1
Belkin is a well-known manufacturer of electronics and telecom equipment . They fabricate many different kinds of telecom cables , including Category 5 . The Cat 5 cord pictured is a low profile , where the insulated connection between the cable and the modular pins , provides protection against damage . Unfortunately like many others , the cord I received does not have factory terminated pins . Substituting a cheaper , lower quality item is misrepresentation at best , and fraudulent at worst.For Cat 5 cables , improper termination is one of the most common reasons for reduced transmission rates , or cable failure . Cables are supposed to be tested for compliance with industry standards , before being sold . On average , a non-insulated connection is more likely to fail , because the cable can more easily be bent or twisted.I bought a factory terminated cord on eBay , made in China , for three dollars . The packaging states that the cord had been ` Verified to ETA/TIA 568 ' standards . Unlike the Belkin cord , which had no statement about testing . I paid half as much and got a better quality item , so when I need another cable , I wo n't be buying this one again.Seems like misrepresentation is going on here . The incorrect image should be pulled , or replaced with an accurate one . It 's not worth my time to return the Belkin cable . The cord works , but I did n't get what I expected , and I would be wary about purchasing any other cords made by Belkin .	-1
My wife bought this for her sewing room so she could at least listen to movies or cd music while she worked sewing . Then one day the LCD TV screen went black , It appears that the TV has know isues for this happening all the time to everybody and the company does not stand behind thier product . Stay away from this thing or you 'll be throwing good money ... ... .Enough said ! ! No stars for this thing	-1
Just died today . Noticed the clock was n't on , my husband determined power coming into the unit , but it will not power up . I believe we had it about a year and a half , purchased from Sam 's Club for about $ 250 . Worked OK , until it did n't work anymore , but had some bad flaws : Sound very low , even at top volume . Not good for the kitchen when cooking . Also , when they unit shut off , the DVD would not remember where it was , it always started up from the beginning .	-1
lasted about 6 months of light use before it started failing . Retracting it would cause the circuit breaker to trip . Eventually it would only provide power based on how far I pulled it out.It 's an extension cord , how hard can it be to fix ? Once you open it , it loses all spring tension , at which point it 's garbage .	-1

You press click with your right index finger - nothing happens.Oops , you got ta do it again because it did n't register.Sometimes when you press the right clicker , it turns the whole page blue . It thinks you 're trying to grab the entire page ? Try again ! You have to repress the clicker and do it again.It 's possible they improved the latest model . But I 'm telling you , I went through two Microsoft mice , the most recent I bought in 2009 . With light , average use ( maybe a few hours a day , 5 days a week ) It is defective , cheap , and constantly malfunctioning over & over . Do you really want to risk it ? Buy a better brand .	-1
I bought this player couple of months before . It worked fine for the past 3 months . But from last week the DVD player just shows `` loading ... '' when I load a DVD and it just stays there forever . When I went to the Coby web site to read about the warranty , I found that the warranty is only for 90 days . If you want an inexpensive DVD player try Cyberhome , I had better experience with that . This player really sucks ! ! !	-1
I purchased a Coby and within 2 months , it died . Well , not died , just massive skipping and freezing up on numerous DVDs . Warranty ? What Warranty . Yeh , spend $ 10 bucks to ship it back and maybe , someday , it will get fixed . Figured it was just a bad unit so bought another later model Coby . Another piece of junk . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR FROM CHINA . SAVE YOURSELF THE COBY HASSLE . SPEND A FEW MORE BUCKS AND GET A KNOWN NAME BRAND .	-1
This amplifier is a good enough design aesthetically for me . Also the amplification provided is enough for my casual use ( hooking up computer or TV to in-wall speakers , indoors and backyard ) . I am not an audiophile so if the sound quality is not as true to source , it does n't bother me ( in other words I ca n't tell the difference mostly ) .Given all that , I was really hoping for this to work out for me - as I am just not comfortable spending significantly more on a simple amplifier that suits my need . But it did n't work out . I ordered it , and right out the box only half the output worked ( I think it 's called channel ) . So whether I had speaker A or B selected , only my left speaker ( say ) would work not the right . I tried to play around to see if the problem was my input , but no it was the amplifier . I was able to hook two speakers by using a common Red connection ( the one side that was working ) while taking the black separately ( which was working on both sides ) . Just as a test , not that I was going to use it like that.I called customer service with a hope that there might be an easy fix . They were great . Within the first couple of minutes they recommended me to just send it back and get a replacement . I would rate their customer service 5 stars , but on this review I want to stay true to spirit and only rate the product - which is a 1 star in my opinion.Needless to say I did n't exchange the product , but simply sent back to Amazon for a refund . I 'll keep looking to find an acceptable solution elsewhere .	-1
I intended this amp to drive an external set of bookshelf speakers for my flatscreen TV . I do have a complete 7.1 system , but I do n't like to fire it up just to watch the news or late evening programs , saving that for CDs/BDs/HD and music with guests . I wanted something a bit richer than the monitor built-ins , my minimum criteria was something in the 15-20w range , with auto-on so I could simply turn on the TV from its remote and be set , all in a compact footprint less than the 17 '' rack-mount standard . I received the amp ( very quick delivery ) , and decided to test it in my office , driving some favorite RCA/Optimus Pro7 bookshelves ( 50Wx2 ) using an iPod for signal input , a setup which is currently driven from my old Technics SA-626 very nicely . On the AMP50 , the output is fine , but the auto-on feature is very flaky , the amp cuts out intermittently and requires a manual re-start . I suspected that the signal strength from the iPod may not be strong enough for the AMP50 to reliably sense , but if that 's the case , then almost any line input signal would produce the same intermittent behavior , particularly if using a variable input at low levels such as the iPod or a TV monitor . There is a loud pop on cold startup ( using the on/off switch ) , I detected a smaller pop on a warm start ( from the auto-on standby , when it worked ) as reported by other reviewers but not startlingly loud . I ran it for about 20 minutes , it got warm to the touch but not hot ; I did not run it for an extended period to test overheating . Inasmuch as one of my main criteria for purchasing the AMP50 was the auto-on feature , its performance is very disappointing . I expect my next attempt will be theAudioengine N22 Premium Desktop Audio Amplifier.For those wanting more of a physical description : The power supply is a brick type , input 120V 75W , output AC 18V 2200mA , about 3 '' x3 '' x4 '' , very heavy , with only about 3 ' of cord on either end ( 120V wall socket , 18V cylindrical output , not labeled but presumed center pin positive ) . The unit itself is moderately well built , sheet metal case ( screwed , not riveted ) , lots of ventilation slots , fuse is accessible from the backside , the speaker connectors are common push-snap type for bare wire ends , the RCA/pin jack inputs are chrome plated . Exterior finish was fine , no burrs or blemishes , flat black paint . The front panel is brushed and painted aluminum , nice but not remarkable . Knobs also appear to be machined and painted aluminum . Its weight is about what you might expect ; not light but not heavy . It accepts RCA/pin jacks or 1/8 '' stereo jack for input . The front power switch is a large pushbutton-toggle type about 5/8 '' diameter ; if you intend to use this without the auto-on feature ( turning it on an off when desired ) , you will find that the action to press the on/off button will want to push the amp back on its shelf , it is not heavy enough to resist the on/off button press action and the enclosure feet are hard plastic ; they slide and do not resist the push . The auto-on/manual select switch is a slide switch on the back panel . When power is off , either manual or auto , the front-panel red LED power indicator goes off ( at least it did so on mine ) , so there is no indication that it is in standby mode . There seemed sufficient power to drive the speakers ( 50Wx2 ) ; with the iPod at full signal output the speakers were comfortable at a volume setting of about half the AMP50 range ; that 's for light listening in my office where I could hold a conversation without turning down the volume . I expect the AMP50 could drive the speakers loudly enough for a backyard party , but not enough to break any glasses.I give it two stars because as an amp , the AMP50 is certainly adequate and up to the task , but a principal feature for which I purchased it ( auto-on ) is to me unsatisfactory .	-1
Received this amp because of some of the positive reviews . Was DOA that would not sense any input no matter what I plugged into it.There is a switch on the back that is labeled to bypass auto-sense input or on all the time . I tried 3 different input sources from my iPhone to an AVR to a known working Airport Express . Tried both sets of inputs , the RCA and the mini-jacks.The red power light goes on and you hear a click from the amp . The amp does get warm , but nothing at all ( no matter what position the auto-sense switch was in ) got the amp to turn green and power up.Returning it now and will try to look for something a bit better .	-1
Not really very useful -- -A bit of overkill . While this case adequately protects the mem chips , it occupies considerable room with all the padding , etc . The individual plastic cases usually furnished with the chips are entirely satisfactory .	-1
Not sure what Belkin was thinking on this . Yes the cable works but each end is like 2 pounds of metal and too of thick of insulation all around . Plus oddly each connector end piece screw apart . Why ? I ended up gluing them together . The weight of this cable would be appropriate for a 1/4 inch headphone set not 3.5mm , it totally outweighs a normal headphone cable . I Regret this purchase a lot .	-1
One day it 's fine , the next , Black Screen O ' Death . Thank goodness the audio works , at least I can use it as a radio . I have a Hitachi circa . 1984 > Still going , an RCA , 1991 still going . My HDTV Super De Duper CT27HL14 , toast after a year and a month . Really very disappointing . Well , no sense in whinning anymore . Onto the `` Service Hosing '' . I 'll update if anything good happens . Maybe `` Class Action Lawsuit '' since so many of us have exactly the SAME problem.And , oh yeah , do n't buy Panasonic anything . You 'll be sorry , eventually . ***UPDATE***Well , we got lucky , the CRT turned out to be defective . This WAS covered under the two year CRT warranty . The Service Center replaced the CRT and it 's working fine now . I was a little rough above with my review , but ... ..Beware .	-1
Tried to use this on a Logitech Deluxe 250 Keyboard and Logitech M-SBF96 mouseLogitech PSE Optical Wheel Mouse - Black ( Pack of 100 ) ( not a 100 of them ... just one . ) , no luck on either of them working . Lights light up on both devices but windows7 , RHEL and bios do n't pick up the signal . Was just going to throw it away ( cost $ 2 with free prime shipping ) , but returning it at Amazons expense since they really should just remove this item due to the high failure rate .	-1
Bought one of these fellers for my laptop to use one of the old IBM 'clicky ' type keyboards ; no trouble using the keyboard with any computer with a ps/2 connector , but the USB converter is not recoginzed with the Dell .	-1
This adapter did not work with my DELL keyboard ... I was shocked . Not sure how they can make it custom , but they did .	-1
I usually always read the reviews ... but didnt for this..my mistake..total POS.Why would amazon even sell this . I should return it but for $ 200 Im not going to waste my time or Amazons time ... Amazon is good to me .	-1
My custom built computer has three of these and their bearings wear out and the blades start hitting the casing . Will try another brand in the future .	-1
This Product Is Only 1 Channel / If You Produce Audio For On Hold ; Be Aware That This Unit Has Extremely Low Memory Built In.Mono Phonic Is The Only Option With This Device.I Did NOT Do My Homework Properly Prior To Purchasing This Product .	-1
I would n't recommend this product to anyone ... It worked without a hitch the first week ; but when I tried to adjust a video setting , the whole capture program stopped functiong . All I am able to do now is edit existing avi. , and mpeg files .	-1
It works well for 2 months . I did use it to record some surgical procedures with endoscopes , but suddenly it don ? t work . I hope it has warranty .	-1
It 's almost like an iPod . It 's interface almost works . The spastic finger up , finger down navigation almost works . It 's weight is almost as light as an iPod . It 's navigation is almost intuitive like the iPod 's . If you 're willing to spend $ 30 less for an second rate MP3 player almost as good as an iPod then this is for you ... of course you could just buy the iPod and not always wonder what you 'd be missing out on .	-1
It 's funny to me that in the MP3 market with all teh possibilities out there for form factor that this company like so many others out there choose to manufacture an iPod look-a-like . Why not get the real thing and get yourself an iPod . This product like all copies of iPod are worthless . Apple like it 's computers makes the best MP3 players in the world .	-1
With the new ( 2010 ) 27 '' iMacs , the privacy screen ca n't seem to handle that much screen real estate . Three inches of both left and right sides are vignetted so much that it 's distracting . I 'm returning this . It probably works great on smaller monitors , but something large like an 27 '' iMac will lead to disappointment.Now , if it only had cost $ 30 I probably would have kept it .	-1
-very tiny-not even as large as a sheet of paper-very flimsy-this is n't a special steal ... you really get what you pay for-I think I may use the one I ordered as a coaster..	-1
Beware that this thing is very small ( perhaps made for 9 '' laptops ) . I bought it hoping that I would also be able to use it by placing on my lap but its a little bigger than HALF of my 15.6 '' laptop and you can not place it on lap . I 'd rather place the warm laptop directly on lap rather than using this tiny thing.I would n't use this on table either as my laptop ( like all laptops ) has little rubbers underneath to lift it up a bit so it does get enough ventilation without any further lift on the table.ONLY on the carpet it can be useful where you may want to avoid dust from going in the vents.I would suggest you to look for dimensions before you buy .	-1
The batteries lasted about a year , and when I went to replacement the cables were too short to replace the batteries without completely dismantling and rebuilding the unit around the batteries.That coupled with the fact that the batteries failed silently ( no audible alarm ) , have me completely turned off from the design/manufacturing of the unit .	-1
A few months in use and my 200 started to dump memory at random intervals . This meant that each time I powered on , it was a gamble as to if my coordinates were still entered . This is very frustrating when I go on a trip , I always have to make sure I have a paper back up source of my information . If you get a 200 that works then I would recommend the unit for beginners but I do n't know how common this problem is .	-1
I 've been buying CD-R 's from Verbatim , SONY , Maxell , Memorex , Tayio Yuden , Philips , TDK , and Rytek for many years . For the longest time , Verbatim , especially the earlier dark blue CD-R 's were amazing . In fact , ALL of those old CD-R 's which are more than 10 years old are still working in any CD player they meet . I 've never had problems with Verbatim until this batch.I have three other brands that are burning just fine , but my burners are not recognizing some of the Verbatims at all , not even to allow the OS to recognize these as blank CD-R 's . About 1 an 4 are bad . I suspect it 's a bad lot , but if the formula has changed , then this could be a potential issue for some.Aside form this issue , Verbatim historically has always been perfect for me .	-1
I am on my third spindle of these blank discs ( I listen to a lot of audio books that I download off the computer ) . When we used to buy other brands , it seemed like every third disc would not record at all . I have not come across a dud yet ! Am very happy with these and will purchase more to be sure . ( EDITED MAY 16 2011 ) I wrote this review about the # 94554 discs which were great , I went through 4-5 spindles of them . Lately they are not available , but # 97458 discs are . These are not so great . They seem to be `` seconds '' . I am only halfway through the spindle of 100 and have 10 `` duds '' already ! ! ! This is very disappointing .	-1
I have been a DVR user through Cox Cable for approx . 1 yr , and have always been disappointed . I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time , and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time , I decided it was time to try Tivo . I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $ 12.95 per month.I received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered , very impressive since I did n't pay to have it shipped that quickly . The setup was reasonably straight forward . I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations , and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me:1 ) My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs ( DVR does this automatically ) . So I ordered the wrong unit . To be honest , I do n't see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner , my family relies on dual tuners A LOT . I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system , to me it 's like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed , a dual tuner is so much more useful.2 ) I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network . No , you have to buy theirs for $ 40 to $ 50 . Since I did n't know that , I had to rely on the phone line option . This really stinks , it is very very very slow . I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming , the system kept getting interuppted during download ( yes I disabled call waiting ) .3 ) When you use the online program guide , it covers up the entire screen . My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner ( approx . 1/4 ) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide . We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on , but that wo n't work so well with Tivo . Plus , scrolling up and down is painfully slow , the screen takes for ever to refresh.4 ) Similarly to item 3 above , when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely , you can only see the Tivo guide . Again , Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.5 ) Remote would n't work with my 42 '' Akai plasma . I ca n't fault Tivo too much on this one , none of the universal remotes seem to work with this TV for some reason.I did love some of the Tivo features and wish my Cox DVR had them:1 ) Wishlist2 ) Tivo Suggestions3 ) Can access your Tivo through internet4 ) View photo 's through Tivo.In the end my items # 3 and 4 were things I just could n't get past , so I returned my Tivo . They were friendly and helpful and I really wanted to like this product , but in my opinion it 's not able to compete with the speed and power of the Cable companies DVR .	-1
I am an original Tivo owner . One of the early adopters and not only did I have a problem with my earlier unit but now that I have upgraded to a new unit Series 2 , 80 hour from TIVO directly ( website ) I have another defective unit . My father purchased one as well and not only was it defective but he had to finally dispose of it as TIVO was impossible to work with to resolve the problem . Warning : Tivo tech support may or may not be available to help you with the problem . Additionally , the tech support web site does not acknowledge the problem evidently occurring with many TIVO owners . Once you get Tech support on the phone they still will not acknowledge this is a known issue . The unit IS unusable with this issue . Unfortunately I will now have to explore other DVRs because TIVO ( as friendly as it 's software is ) doesnt work . There is a clear pattern emerging on the part of TIVO of knowingly shipping defective units , known serious software issues , known tech support unavailability etc . I would n't mind so much but the process of setting up a new TIVO is a multiple step lengthy process that requires the user to interact with and answer multiple on screen menu questions . The user also must spend a lot of time programming the device with desired recordings , preferences etc only to find out after many hours of frustration that the unit is defective and must be disconnected , boxed up and shipped back to TIVO . I wouldnt be surprised if TIVO reluctantly admitted publicly in the future that they are having real problems delivering a working product . Good Luck .	-1
Why even think about this generic & # 34 ; will fit & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; might work & # 34 ; cable ? . Do a little research and you can find a & # 34 ; genuine & # 34 ; , made by/for Canon cable for less than 50 cents more . Vendors like this who intentionally deceive customers should not be supported , especially when you get the real thing for a couple of cents more . Amazon should be ashamed to allow this type of deception .	-1
Item IS NOT MADE BY CANON as described , it was not white , as in photo , but black , did not have the damper adaptors on the USB wire as original does , and was not flexible but very rigid . Clearly a Cheaply made Knock Off sold as a Genuine Canon IFC-400PCU USB Cable . VERY DISAPPOINTED , and will throw item away , and look for a better Quality item	-1
The Disc repair plus did not repair as described after 3 tries on a lightly scratched DVD . It 's just a high priced DVD duster . Sent back , would have gave it a 1 star if it could not at least clean it .	-1
Bought this after I read that it would remove some surface plastic because I had some light to moderate scratches in a disk damaged by an LG DVD/CD disk player in my desktop . After running the cleaning buffing and repair cycles a few times without acceptable results , I figured it was just some bad buffing disks . I contacted Aleratec to see if they would send another pair of buffing disks . They declined to do so . I bought another set of buffing disks and tried them . After several run cycles the disk was worse off than it was before . I do not recommend this product	-1
I found that this switch gets pretty hot , and turns it self off every couple days , after working fine for a couple months . If I unplug it , let it cool , and then plug it back in , it works for a couple more days . I have not tried netgear support yet to return it , or otherwise troubleshoot .	-1
The first 550 we purchased was DOA . Returned to seller , and replaced with # 2 . # 2 worked for 30 days , then dead . Past sellers return limit , so sent to Fuji . 3 weeks now , waiting for replacement ... Do n't buy this camera ! !	-1
I was using this radio for several months , everything was cool & pretty , outstanding performance . A few weeks ago , I was travelling and left the radio inside the radio cover and the radio is now like a chewing gum , sticky , gummy and ugly ! Unable to use ! ! So , do n't waste money .	-1
This is the most frustrating purchase I have made in years . I bought this to listen to local baseball games at work and to have a travel radio for AM and FM listening . I do n't use the shortwave feature , so I ca n't comment on that performance.It uses an analog dial tuner . It is very sensitive and almost impossible to tune to the frequency . When you are able to finally get it tuned , it drifts off the frequency , whether AM or FM . The AM reception is really bad .	-1
1 . I received a 10ft monitor cable ( Male to Female ) in a `` Male to Male '' package.2 . The quality of the connections was poor . I had a difficult time attaching the single male end to my monitor -- the rubber end just slips on the screws . I bought a different cable at the same time and the difference in quality was like night and day.I returned the cable for refund -- there was no way I wanted a replacement of this cable .	-1
I 'm not an expert but the problem may come down to how much surrounding interference you 've got that 's likely to effect a cheap cable that 's not adequately shielded . I ran mine through a rat 's nest of power cords for four machines with audio and external drive cables in there as well . I 've also got two pairs of fairly heavy Altec Lansing speakers alongside the monitor.The resulting signal was seriously ghosted to the point where it bothered my eyes after a couple of hours.To compare , I brought home a VGA cable from work and was shocked at the difference running along the same path . Not only is the picture crisp but the colors are richer.I wish I could recommend the cable from work but I 've no idea who makes it - we 're a Dell shop and it 's got those blue plugs that look like the cables that ship with Dells .	-1
I should have listened to the other reviews . I could only reach 1600 resolution instead of 1920 from my other VGA cable . I put it on my 21 '' monitor and it had crappy resolution and blinked an error message.Save your money and buy something from the store .	-1
Bought two as backups . Ca n't use either . Both ghost so badly that I would n't keep them in the draw for emergencies . I 'm sorry i did n't test them right away but that 's my fault for believing a cable is a cable.I personally would n't recommend these to anyone for any reason . Reading the reviews since my purchase i see almost half of all reviewers are disappointed with their purchase so it seems to be a crap-shoot . You may be the lucky one to get an okay one , but i was n't .	-1
Worked only for 2 weeks . Then I had fuzzy lines on my monitor using this cable . After a month of use it finally died .	-1
Do n't buy this product . Spend a little more and you can get a much superior product . This thing is cheap and the construction reflects that . I would suggest Cable2Go ( C2G ) product . It works so much better . I will never buy this product again ! !	-1
got it and plugged it into my computer once and it has n't worked since . It not worth a dime ... very unhappy	-1
This thing provides less light when aimed directly at the keyboard than the laptop screen does with the screen pointed slightly upward . It 's very , very bad . Yes , it 's only a few bucks , but it 's not even worth that . Seriously . I 'll be returning my simply for the principle of the thing.EDIT : It fell apart a few days after I wrote this review and I just threw it away . It 's a real piece of junk .	-1
does not move easy and there is no on off switch you must unplug it to turn off would not buy again .	-1
It works well but it 's not as bright as other ones I 've bought of amazon before . Does the job and is smaller than other ones , but if you work at night , you might need a more powerful one .	-1
The reason why the battery was dead so soon , I found out from the Internet , that the battery would be damaged , if fully charged and not using for a period of times .in my case , I charged it and after came back from a trip about 10 day , I found out the battery was unchargeable . The RCA deserved no star or minus star rating	-1
Arrived , D.O.A.RED POWER LIGHT GOES ON , BUT THE GREEN LIGHT- ( WORKING LIGHT DOES NOT- ) NO POWER COMING OUT OF THE UNIT , IT LOOKED NICE , IT WAS WELL BUILT , TO BAD IT DID NOT WORK	-1
Totally wrong harness for my vehicle . I had a great deal of problem locating the correct harness as hen I looked it defaulted back to this harness .	-1
I bought this product to connect my new radio to the antenna in my 07 Chevy Cobalt , Amazon says that it fits my car with their little utility but do n't be fooled , it does not fit the stock antenna adapter	-1
I think it was made for a different model stereo than the stock one that the ad said it work for . The money and time not worth it to refund .	-1
This adapter fit my stereo , but I discovered that I needed a different wiring harness for my car . I was removing the stereo until I cold get a new harness , and I could n't remove this adapter from the back of the ( brand new ) stereo . The fit was so tight that when it finally came out , I was looking at a bare copper wire , and the other half of the plug was stuck in the back of the stereo ! An hour with needlenose pliers and hemostats eventually got the plug out , and luckily there was no damage to the stereo . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I bought this for my 2012 Wrangler and it does not fit the antenna or stereo . I have no clue what I was sent but I tossed the packaging and had to forgo listening to satellite/AM/FM.They probably sent me the wrong thing but I am just deciding to write something now .	-1
Even though the ordering info clearly said that these would fit my 2007 Dodge Ram , it did n't , and I ended up just cutting off the factory connectors and hard-wiring the new speakers . Very disappointing .	-1
This installed into a 2004 Hyundai Sonata.It does make a lot of noise.It Is JUNK Worked For A Week.Getting A Refund From Amazon .	-1
Recently purchased car receiver ( standard size ) and it had no hopes of fitting , as several people stated . Thanks to Amazon 's return policy I did get a refund . First of several hundred Amazon purchase that I ever returned .	-1
I bought this for my 2000 chevy silverado , which amazon advised it fit . It does not . This product is for a Double Din application , a 2000 Chevrolet silverado/ck1500/tahoe/suburban requires a 1.5 DIN application . Make sure to double check your sizes !	-1
This harness did not work with my 1996 Buick Park Avenue . A trip to Wal-Mart got a Scoche kit with plug ends that matched .	-1
If you own a 2005 Grand Prix , DO NOT order this one . The connector is not the same . I had to buy one locally to install the radio and return it . For a $ 5 cable , it cost me 2 to ship back ... disappointing .	-1
The book inside the bag was correct.The parts inside the bag did not match the book.The book drawings would have worked.So I bought one off of Ebay and it was correct .	-1
received a bad unit where one of the speaker would not produce audio unless I put pressure on the harness ... returned it back	-1
I got this fit my BMW and when you go to connect this to the car connection the pins on the back pop out . Had to push them back in while it was connected . It ok but they have secure the pins better .	-1
It wont simply fit in the provided space.Please think twice , before you decide to order this product , read other reviews as well .	-1
Fit the jeep . But was too thin for the deck . ( Got the correct one , and fit great ) . It was just a regular single din.deck .	-1
Before you buy , check out the blogs about Creative 's customer service . There IS none ! Most of us who spent a lot of money last year to buy a Creative Zen Nomad Xtra were disappointed to find out that this mp3 player does NOT support any of the Janus subscription services ( like Rhapsody to Go , Napster to Go , Yahoo 's to go service ) . That is bad enough , but any attempt to get a straight answer from the company about firmware updates ( so that we CAN use these very cool services ) is met with either no response , or a canned `` This device does not support these services at this time . '' No one has been able to find out when or even IF they ever will . I suspect not.The other problem is that both my Nomad and my son 's have a serious freeze-up problem , one to the point of not being able to be used.I would highly recommend another mp3 player if you are considering the Nomad and certainly do n't buy from Creative , they pretty much do n't care at all about their customers once you buy from them .	-1
My hard drive failed at seven months . I knew that dealing with Creative was not going to go well as they had already scammed me on the rebate . The technical service is horrible and unprofessional- Creative does not stand behind its products and treated me with contempt and disrespect . And that 's if you can get them to answer the phone . I purchased an Ipod after that and even though there is the battery issue , Apple has a totally different attitude towards its customers and technical support . Especially with the recent decreases in ipod prices , drop your coffee habit for a month or two and spend the additional money it takes to get a truly great product- the Ipod .	-1
This set , especially the keyboard , is extremely susceptible to interference making it a great way to make you go insane while trying to write the most basic text . Needless to say , forget about gaming ! Sorry for the short review but I ca n't keep writing with this thing any longer.DO NOT BUY THIS ! ! !	-1
I bought this for the convenience of using it with Windows Media Center from the couch , for which it excels.However , during a commercial , i decided to log in to my bank account until i realized dangerous that could be . After doing some quick research , I learned that Microsoft 's encoding was cracked long ago , and that anyone within a 10-15meter radius who wants to could easily monitor everything you type : passwords , gossip , your google searches , everything.I 'm in a NYC apartment building , so I was at more risk than anyone in the suburbs , but be forewarned !	-1
I was a long time user of the wireless natural keyboard and it broke and I was looking for a replacement . I purchased this keyboard thinking it was going to be a good keyboard and boy was I wrong.First of all if you are familiar with the natural keyboards they are the ones that have the split keyboard and the keys in the center are at least an inch away from eachother in the center . the comfort keyboard is not split in the center its just curved and is supposed to feel the same but it doesnt . I typed about two emails and my hands were already hurting.The mouse is also bad . The buttons are very hard or stiff . I was having to press very hard to get the buttons to work . The scroll button was very hard as well . I had the scroll button programed to use as a back button and it hardly ever registered the function.I had to return this keyboard and instead purchased an upgraded version of my original keyboard which is now the microsoft wireless natural multimedia keyboard with matching wireless intellimouse explorer 2.0 . I am so happy with this keyboard and my hands are fine now even after typing this long review .	-1
I 've had this keyboard for 2+ years and had always been great . Quick to type , love the ergo shape . However lately its been really annoying . Its really slow on the connection , so it takes 6+ seconds to type 1 letter . And I really ca n't spend hours to type 1 sentence . Very disappointed .	-1
This is a fairly solidly built mouse ; and is rather intuitive and obvious to use . It has two buttons and a scroll wheel . Plug the snap-in receiver and start using the mouse straight away . Battery life is also good ; with daily use a single AA cell lasts between 6-10 months.However ... a measure of the quality of the device has to be also based on longevity . Two years after purchasing this mouse , one fine morning its left-click button stopped working . I tried turning off and back on the mouse , changed the battery , gave it a rest and tried again , dusting the mouse to remove any dust or particles that may have found its way in . To no avail . The button has simply stopped working . Two years is pitifully less . I have mice from the 1990s that still work . So this is fairly disappointing.This may well be a one-off , but that is little consolation . I expected better reliability and build quality .	-1
I bought one from another site.. for about 11 dollars ( it was on sale specials.. not anymore ) And I bought it for my teacher so that he might be able to lecture easier with wireless ... ( his laptop is only 10 feet ish away from his laptop ... .. And it did n't work . It was embarassing when I sent a present for a teacher and does n't work ! So the second day , I gave him my own Logitech M305 . which is also a brand new mouse I just had over december ... bought a little later ... less than a month used . And the Logitech works terrifically for my teacher . It has triple distance with a way smaller receive . Everybody let 's screw microsoft until they make something better , competitive in the market ... If you do n't need long distance ... it may be okay . I do n't mean to be totally biased . But know that I do n't like this mouse . And I 'm a budget saver . but my logitech was only $ 5 cheaper and delivers awesome work ! son of a microsoft..	-1
So much for this mouse . Used it three or four times , it stopped working . Changed battery . Worked for an hour . Changed battery again . Worked for a couple of hours . Then nothing.Not worth the time it 's taking me to write this review.F+ ( The plus is for it 's feel , which is just right for me and my Sony Vaio laptop . )	-1
I either have horrible luck with Microsoft mice ( not just laptop mice ) or the product quality stinks as I 've been through three different types of mice ( the presenter mouse , and two of these mice ) and they 've started to be very inconsistent in performance after a few months . At first they work fine , but then after a while the mouse skips on the screen when you move it and then becomes nearly unusable . Microsoft keyboards seem to work fine , but stay clear of their mice . Logitech makes better hardware for the money .	-1
This is the least accurate mouse we own , and we own more than a handful . I was using this mouse on a broad armed leather chair . Every mouse I 've ever used on the chair has performed very well . It 's almost a perfect material for a mouse pad -- firm , not shiny , not rigid . Yes this mouse just tracks poorly . Also , the Logitech optical mouse we 've bought has a more convenient storage device for the USB dongle . This one has to be pried off . The Logitech one just slides into a slot .	-1
Not a good choice - batteries have to be replaced every 2 weeks . I found one at Bestbuy for half the price and love it .	-1
I hoping to use the WGR101 to provide wireless , encrypted access to two laptops from a wired ethernet connection in a hotel . It worked fine in single-user , no encryption mode but that is not what I needed . I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP . One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals . Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection , sometimes I had to reboot the laptops , sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101 , and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101 . Stay away from this product unless single user , unencrypted access is what you need .	-1
worked about a week and stoped working cable was tight but picture was always going out even after moving it around alittle 2 get the picture backso i just purchased a DVI-D to HDMIu better off buying this dvi-d to HTMI Connector instead and just use your HTMI CABLE WITH THIS ADAPTERplug in one in of your HTMI cable into the Adapter and the other in into the HTMI Portnote : if u using this on a HDTV Like i did make sure u have the audio and video cable pluged in in the back of your tv audio/video portd ( red and white )	-1
the lit rocker switch is poorly position , VERY easy to hit and thereby shutting off all power when plugging in near the switch . The switch is also easy to trip ; almost no finger pressure needed to turn off the unit . Furman makes pro level stuff and IMO items like this one tends to cheapen the Furman reputation	-1
I just got these delivered today , took 11 days to arrive . Unacceptable for anything within the US . Bought them brand new , I ca n't understand why the next model above these is the highest rated cans on amazon , as soon as I took them out of the plastic I could feel that they were cheaply made , predominately cheap feeling plastic , and the sides wanted to swivel backwards more than stay straight . THEN I put them on just to see how they felt and sounded . I have a 7 year old pair of Sennheiser HD-280 Pros , and I just bought a refurb pair of Sony V6 's . Both of the models I just mentioned completely blow these ATs away , in every aspect . The sound from these is tinny and you have to apply pressure to them to allow the bass to come through completely . Both the Sony V6 And the Senns are very comfortable , and I actually prefer the sound of the low priced refurb Sony V6 to my Senns , it is more crisp and clear . These however , are crap . I will never buy another AT product again . The return slip is printing as I type . I just unboxed these 15 minutes ago . That 's how bad they are . I 'm using the return money to buy another pair of V6s = ) Oh and I am playing all these through a Fiio E7 so it 's not my amp . I am SO annoyed at these . If they were n't worth the return money I would smash them , or light them on fire or something .	-1
After reading the reviews for the ATH M40 's - I ( wrongly ) thought it might be a nice replacement for my Bose AE 1 ( around $ 90 prime ) . Oh dear - so wrong , on so many levels.I 'm comparing the Bose AE 1 - used to be called the Triports ( NOTE - not the newer AE2 ) . The Bose are light , spacious , sound tight , comfortable . They are classics for lightweight ( not canceling ) headphones . The sound field is bright and expansive . Bass is there but not overpowering . The sound is fresh , not mushy.The ATH M40 's are half the cost but NOT worth the savings . They are heavy , plasticy , too flimpsy ( I hate the flexible ear-pieces ) . The cable is heavy and **OH NO , THEY DIDN'T** is capped with an old-school plug . AND THERES NO ADAPTER IN THE PACKAGE ! . You are forced to buy it separately . All of which means that there is even more weight hanging from your jack or iPhone ( in my case ) . The sound to me is more claustrophobic . Encased , the stereo effect is n't as open nor as bright . Its also hard to remember which is the left/right ear.So , I 'm ordering one of the last AE1 Triports I can find here on Amazon . The ATH 40 's will be returned , and the stupid plug adapter added to the dead-drawer .	-1
BEWARE OF POSSIBLE , PERMANENT DEVICE DAMAGE WHEN USING THIS EXTENSION CABLE . I connected product to my Dell Inspiron E1705 , which successfully recognized it as a new hub device . I then connected a working external disk drive to the extension . The drive was not detected by computer . Same result when connecting a Flash/Thumb drive . Removed extension cable.Had to reboot computer ( hard shutdown ) to recover USB plug-and-play functionality that had temporarily been blocked by using the extension cable . Now found that my external drive gives an unrecoverable error when I connect it to computer . Attempts to replace driver ( which was simply the Windows default for such devices ) were unsuccessful ( and unnecessary ) . After the reboot , other USB devices ( including the Flash/Thumb drive ) once again were correctly recognized with no other problems . Since subject drive also possesses a Firewire interface , I tried this and was able to use the drive normally . Disconnected drive and tried again with various USB ports on computer and various USB A/B cables . Same result as before.Conclusion : This active extension cable not only fails to work , it also can permanently damage the USB interface in your external disk drive .	-1
This extender cable plain does not work in true USB 2.0 mode . It is too slow to be used as an interface to a WinRadio . Really too bad that it does not work as advertised .	-1
I purchased this for one of my relatives who was headed to France . The DVD player came out of the box fine , and we charged it according to the directions . Worked great for about 5 months . Then as the France trip approached , the DVD player would start , then play a quick trailer , then screen went white , then totally dark . No video . So in an effort to get it replaced , I used the product protection plan I bought from NEW Customer Service . What a joke ! They told me I paid too much money to Amazon for the plan , based upon the purchase price , and that I would have to get Amazon to refund my money before they could process the replacement/repair . When I asked them to override the payment they said OK but have never heard from NEW again , and now I have Amazon trying to figure it out . But calls to customer service there and e-mails also have not worked . I keep getting e-mails from someone , obviously in a customer service center in Asia , that acknowledge my complaint but do nothing . Best to call Amazon and get a live person . In the meantime , I went out and paid full price for a Sony DVD player and the relative is happily traveling throughout France with a product that works and performs to our expectations . Rule 1 , do n't buy the Audiovox . Rule 2 , definitely do n't buy the product replacement plan from NEW . They really stuck me on this . If I could rate lower than 1 star I would .	-1
This portable DVD player is about 1.5 '' in height , which in my book is not `` ultra slim . '' Take a look at Sony 's VAIO T series laptops ; they are less than an inch at the thickest point , now *that* is ultra slim . This Audiovox is thick and bulky , and the 7 '' screen looks awefully small even in a car .	-1
We purchased this radio for my mother-in-law a while back now.The dial is lighted for easy tuning and the dial itself has a little resistance so when you find your station , you do not slip past it . Smart & Easy ! More importantly , the sound quality is very good indeed.Problem : the selector switch has failed . When you switch to AM , it stays on the FM station that was playing beforehand..Wiggle and jiggle it , and the AM might come on.We bought another radio for my mother-in-law , and I now use this in the garage.It does have a very rich stereo sound - just ca n't get AM .	-1
I bought this to play music in my toddler 's room . The sound quality is pretty bad , however it survived all kinds of abuse from my son playing with it , so I 'll have to give it marks for that . No adult with normal hearing would want to use this to play music . It would be fine for something like talk radio .	-1
A broken piece rattled inside the box before even opening it upon receipt . Radio worked , but nothing related to the cd player did , which was what I had bought this unit for . Return policy from the Marketplace seller was worse than not having one . Their service was practically non-existent . I 've had a few Emerson products of various sorts in the past . This is the first one that did not work perfectly and last for many years . I can not recommend this product on any level . It was a total waste of time and money .	-1
Just what I needed and yes it does lock up fairly often . But my real gripe is that this camera is almost useless . The light level is non-existent , and even well lit images are VERY dark . No combination of setting seems to overcome it ( for the first week , I kept looking at the front lens wondering if a protective film was there ) . I do not have another unit to compare with , but this is bad . The WiFi works fine , and as a media player ( the market niche for this unit ) I have no complaints . Screen brightness is sufficient , and battery life is enough for a very long day . But oh that camera .	-1
I only really have one complaint . The coating just does not feel right somehow . The sound is interesting . You have to get used to them . The only thing for me is that I feel I not really playing . They are kind of neat but is it not the same . I think I will have to try a lot more different Regular strings . My view or another persons view does not cut it . You have to try things for your self . Even though they are kind of neat in some ways I will move on for the time being . They are worth trying one time though . If you had a lot of guitars and could put some on one that you only used when you wanted to and the cost did not bother you , then I would have given them a five star . Coating is just not that great to have to have on all the time . My experience is limited . If I get more experience and change my mind I will come back and amend . These strings have not held up at all for me . I would not even recommend them if you had more than one guitar . I do not see they are any better than regular cheaper strings . I do not feel they are as good either .	-1
I am older and I bought this harness to take the weight of the tenor sax off of my neck . I am of fairly average size for an adult male , 5'10 ' tall , 160 lbs. , and I can not adjust this harness to feel comfortable -- -the side straps cut into my lats . The harness is also difficult to adjust to have the mouthpiece come up to my mouth ; instead I end up getting it sort of close to where I want the mouthpiece to be , and then bend my neck to bring my mouth down to the mouthpiece ( and this is not how you want to play the sax ) .I should have returned this product , but I tried to make it work.The basic Neotech 1901162 for about $ 11 to $ 16 is better , but be careful selecting the size . For tenor sax players you are likely to need the X-Long , which really is n't very long . The & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; , is just a little too short for tenor -- -- Neotech could have easily added a few inches of material to the & # 34 ; regular & # 34 ; size and it would have worked for most people for both alto and tenor sax .	-1
I 've always heard lots of nice things about this spray cleaner when used for camera lenses and computer monitors . I , however , bought a bottle so that I could use it to clean my glasses . ( Why this brand ? It was the first one to pop up when searched for & # 34 ; glasses lens cleaner & # 34 ; . ) Unfortunately , it was a terrible choice . Rather than removing dirt and grime from my glasses , leaving the lenses crystal-clear , the Carl Zeiss spray cleaner left smudges and streaks that sometimes made the problem worse instead of improving it.I ca n't comment on performance for other things , but if you 're thinking of using this for glasses - well , keep looking . There 's got to be a better spray for that purpose available !	-1
The item shown in the image is not the item that arrived . What I received was MUCH lower in quality that what is shown ( rather than mesh it is cheap plastic sheeting ) . Overall construction also feels very cheap ( some stitches are loose plus the Velcro is n't properly attached ) . On top of all that the item arrived USPS with postage due !	-1
Not enough light to work with . I would not buy this product if you 're looking for a good amount of lighting area .	-1
It 's good preamp , it really boosted my signal , which is what I wanted it to do , but it recorded such a loud hum that my recordings were useless .	-1
The mouse itself is quite nice ... includes a multi-directional scroll wheel.The problem is with the bluetooth software . Microsoft bluetooth mice will only work with Microsoft bluetooth software , and MS bluetooth software is n't very good . It does n't include a serial port , so forget about hotsyncing your bluetooth PDA through the BT dongle that 's included . The MS bluetooth software does not allow you to make use of ICS on Windows XP , which is even more bizarre . In fact , forget about using almost any bluetooth product that 's not Microsoft . Typical of Microsoft.Save your money..avoid this mouse . Use another brand of bluetooth mouse ... or juse buy an rf mouse and save money . Bluetooth technology is vastly overrated , horribly complex , and frequently incompatible with devices from other companies .	-1
I 've had great success with Belkin wireless products in the past . I 've installed several for friends and everyone has been very satisfied . My lucky streak has ended with this device.Setup was not successful with the CD . I got things working through the router 's web interface . I always feel a bit uneasy about equipment that starts working for no apparent reason . Once up , the router worked great for wired computers but has a habit of dropping the wireless connection.I updated the firmware which was problematic as well . The `` Update Firmware '' shortcut on the web interface connected me to what I later discovered was an outdated file that the router would not accept after multiple attempts to update . Had to go to the support website and download the updated firmware there . Come on Belkin , that 's just plain sloppy . Had no problems updating with that version.Wireless continued to be problematic.I hate to do it , but I 'm sending it back .	-1
it works as a condenser ... lot of barrel like noise inside ... which means the model 3000 above it , is quite a bit better ... butif you can find this mic for less than usd 80it is quite ok for vocal , ( must TWEAK EQ a lot tho ) and acoustic bass or guitar or cello , etc..again , MUST tweak eq to reduce 100 to 1000 hz range , and increase the above 4k range ... in order to make it sound acceptable for semi decent recording ... from the eq tweaks u now get the ideaof how this thing sounds ... it is ok ... just barely acceptable..u want better , then get a GAP fc 4.not much tweaking ncessary but beware of QC probs ... tooso get from a really good dealer who can give u a new oneif the fc4 u got , overloads or got too much noise eh.thanksand hv fun .	-1
I 've burned almost 100 Memorex 8X discs in four different PC DVD Burners . Roughly 1/4 errored during the burn . Of those that burned , over 1/2 pixelate and lock up when played on PC or home DVD player . My firmware is up to date and I have n't had this much trouble with any other DVD-R except for Staples brand . I give them 2-stars since they do work well in my home theater DVD Burners but only in Standard Play mode and at 1X burn speed . In EP or faster burn modes , they pixelate .	-1
I found that these DVD-Rs did not work well in my system , were unreliable and slow . I can not recommend them .	-1
nice picture and sound , however , the system did not change the channels making the entire system useless . Beware before you buy	-1
I wanted to buy this item ( since the 2.4MHZ item of the same kind did not work at my place due to all the interferences ) but the previus review stopped me . I wonder if the previous reviewer 's situation was corrected by amazon.com in that they sent the right item . I could not find the direct email of the previous reviewer to ask directly .	-1
This is a good product , but did not work in my house . The transmitter and receiver need to have direct view of each other . I have concrete walls in my house , therefore it did not work very well . But I still got a signal , just with lots of lines/interference .	-1
I seldom write a negative review unless I feel there is something compellingly wrong with s product . I have owned two sets of this product as well as an extra replacement transmitter . I previously recommended this product to a friend . The major attraction was the 5.8Mhz instead of 2.4Mhz frequency utilized . My experience was as follows.I have had two transmitters and one receiver fail . The two transmitters each got stuck on a single channel ( you can select from 4 different channels ) . The receiver lost audio on one side of the stereo outputs . All of these items failed after one year , but less than two years after purchase . I recently requested an RMA from RFLINK . Their response was a poorly worded email response that said the unit was out of warranty and that I should go to the RFLINK web site , select `` where to buy '' and buy a new unit . They absolutely offered no repair/replacement alternative . Just buy new.While a one year warranty is quite common . I do not believe anyone who purchases this item expects it to fail within two years.The friend I recommended this item to had his unit fail within one year . He did get a refurbished replacement from RFLINK.I recommend trying to use a competitive product even though they all seem to use the 2.4Mhz range .	-1
These are now the new wireless technology . They should have changed the model number and named the model number something else . They are not compatible with the older version of transmitters ( 5812 ) . When I bought this , I thought I was getting an add-on receiver that would work with my existing transmitter . I later found out it was because it 's now the new wireless technology , so the older version transmitters wo n't work with this one . Sucks . The new technology is n't even any better , either . I 've tried this `` new technology '' and it 's not any better . The picture still is n't very clear and there 's interference . Since I ca n't get the old ones anymore , I decided to try and hard-wire my kitchen so I wo n't be using ANY transmission systems anymore .	-1
i thought this set would be have a lower profile but they stick out quite a bit . they are large and bit bit bulky . they fit nice however , very snug .	-1
Purchased this antenna to extend the range of my linksys compact wireless router . Made no difference at all ! Tried to return but could not get a return authorization number from the vendor . Also , I was surprised at the size of the antenna - it was much bigger than I anticipated and did not fit in the space where I had the router located .	-1
This is NOT an HGA7S , OEM or otherwise . It 's just someones wishful thinking about their cheap aftermarket antenna . It does n't even have the range of the stubby antenna that come with Linksys devices .	-1
Since I added these antennas I have seen no improvement in signal strength..Transmit or receive . I 'm a ham radio operator and with upgraded antennas I would expect better performance . Since the router is flashed with DDWRT I can see all received signal strengths and they 're all the same . So I 'm not returning the but I am also not recommending them . I 'll continue to look for a better antenna .	-1
I got 0~1 bars on my wifi detector and hoped that this would help . But it did n't get any better . You 'll have to get some decent signal beforehand in order to get this antenna to make things better for you , I suppose .	-1
I see no change in the signal strength using the high gain antennas . There may be better transmission quality , but the meter on my computer reads 18 Mbps transfer rate regardless of whether I use the original antennas or the high gain antennas . I have no way to assess if there are fewer dropped packets .	-1
first off , this is probably the least expensive FM transmitter on the market . Is it worth the money to pay for this ? NO ! save up for a better one , or dont bother spending money at all.why ? 1 ) the manufacture claims battery life is not `` greatly '' affected . In my experience with using this product over the course of 2 days , my battery has lost almost half power playing 15 songs with the iTrip activated ( somewhat ) . an iPod is supposed to last 8 hours.2 ) programming the iTrip is very hard , and takes getting used to . I finally memorized the directions for doing so on the manufactures website , yet i still receive no/partial/temporary signal from the iPod to the radio . I have tried this mutliple times on multiple occasions . Sometimes i will receive a signal , sometimes none , and sometimes just plainly horrible quality.3 ) Installation requires you to download a playlist of radio stations to your iPod ( in essecense you will then use this playlist later to `` try '' and program it to broadcast over the radio.This playlist is a bad idea and is incredibly annoying , because if you decide to use your iPod mini 's shuffle feature , you will play songs on the iPod , however you will also include random bits of that entire iTrip playlist you HAVE to install.Overall , i would rate this product a 1/5 . If i could rate any lower , i would ... Its rare you find products that are so poorly designed and supported , but i would have to say this is one.My iTrip has since been returned for a FULL refund , because if it isnt going to accomplish its primary purpose 75 % of the time , why keep it ? The only thing good about this product is installation , which took roughly 5 minutes , however actually setting up the iTrip in your care EVERY TIME ; 10.I have asked around to some of my friends who currently had iPods , and most of them experienced similar if not the same exact problems . Buyers Beware and good luck !	-1
I ca n't review this product due to the fact that you NEVER delivered it to my address and it was returned to your stores.I doubt if I will perform any further purchases from your site .	-1
I bought two of these for streaming music in my apartment . It is a *small* apartment where I already have a wireless network working perfectly . I carefully read the instruction manual , which was not helpful at all . It kept repeating what you can do with the product `` you can stream music to your ... . '' but never tells you HOW to make that happen beyond telling you to run the setup program . I could n't figure that out without reading the manual ? The setup program seemed simple . The first time it failed because my existing router was set up with the proper security ( hidden SSID , WEP ) , which the setup program does n't know how to deal with . I had to turn all network security off in my existing wireless network . That is right , you have to make your network totally insecure in order to set up this product.Having my network wide open to hackers made me want to get the setup over with as quickly as possible , but that is impossible . It failed more than a dozen times to complete the setup , and I had to go and manually reset the Airports each time.Finally I got one to complete the setup , but it then promptly lost the settings after about 3 songs , and I was expected to do it all over again . No way ! These are nice looking devices that appear to be simple to use , but do n't be fooled . They have no external antenna , which means their range is very poor ( it could n't maintain signal across my small apartment ) , the software is buggy , and the setup process tedious and error prone.Do n't just take my ( or anyone else 's ) word for it , check out the Apple website support forums . There were 43 pages with about 20 posts per page asking for help when I searched there for answers to my problems.I recommend one of the other solutions , I certainly am returning these and going with a different one .	-1
After much research , I bought this product to play audio and had high hopes . I already was using iTunes in Windows.I found it remarkable that the installation and documentation neglected a very common Windows configuration : a desktop PC with a wired connection to a wireless router . Their wizard configuration tool only seemed geared towards PCs that are on a wireless network . Well , when a PC has a wired connection to wireless router , it has no knowledge about the wireless network.Luckily , there are many helpful reviews here on Amazon that deal with this . Thank you to everyone who took the time to fill in Apple 's gaps ! It 's just amazing that Apple did n't deal with this better . I thought they would have tried harder to make a good first impression for Windows users.I got it all working , but the performance and reliability were very disappointing . I gave it a fair chance , but could n't justify keeping if for something that basically did n't work for me.I returned it and bought a Roku SoundBridge M500 instead . For just $ 20 more , I got something that works very well and has a display and remote . It 's in the same location I had the AirPort , but works so much better .	-1
I was very disappointed when I received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables . Cables that you can pick up at Radio Shack for MUCH cheaper . Just ridiculous . The Airport Express itself is fantastic , but skip this accessory and go to your local Radio Shack for the mini-RCA cable , and a quick search online for the optical to mini .	-1
this was the wrong type for my use .	-1
Very cheaply built , non-adjustable focus , cast plastic lens . It does function at a very basic level to identify the slide subject matter , but it is in no way good enough to inspect slides for details .	-1
Great features for the price . Image quality is so-so but is as advertised . It worked great when using a wired connection . When I tried to connect using my AirportExtreme it was a no go . I tried everything . Removing security . Renaming the network . All I got was a flashing yellow light which makes trouble shooting pretty hard . Panasonic support tried to help but nothing worked . It is being returned .	-1
Camera very slow to respond to commands . Needs to be reset almost daily . Picture quality not as good as my other Linksys 54G cameras . Ca n't connect at all most of the time .	-1
If the description here is correct , this set is completely crippled compared to other Panazonic models . It is said it will only read DVD -R written on other Panasonic recorders ( ! ! ! ) and that it can only write to and read DVD -R. Panasonic used to make recorders limited to writing DVD -R , but since then has produced sets that can write to DVD -R DVD + R and DVD -RW . Why the jump backwards ? I 've never heard of any model that can only read DVD -R produced by recorders only of the same brand . This is absurd ! The price listed is also about double wha it should be.Add all this to the other complaints and it 's avoid at all costs.I incidentally own a Panasonic with a 80 GB hard disk and have recorded many hundreds of hours to the HD and made hundreds of DVDs without a problem.Anyway , I would n't buy ANY DVD recorder now unless it has an ATSC tuner included . Otherwise it becomes obsolete in two years when analogue TV is supposed to disappear.Manufacturers , including Panasonic , are making sets with the digital tuners for the European market . Why not in the USA ?	-1
This adapter is a piece of junk . I took it to Italy and it worked twice and then quit working . I tried different outlets ... everything , and no luck . Fortunately I always take a back up adapter but with all the devices that need charging having only one is a hassle . If I could rate this 0 stars I would . Save your money and do n't take a chance on this worthless device .	-1
This is an old design that has two significant flaws.On the input , as others have noted , it only accepts unpolarized two-prong plugs . No polarized plugs , no three-prong grounded plugs.The European adapter is an odd shape although perhaps it would fit . BUT it is the older ungrounded European plug . This will not work in grounded European sockets.This should be made clear in the product description.I 'm returning it .	-1
This device has no markings on packaging.Directly inside box , says `` This Device is Not Compatable With Windows Vista '' Would have been nice to know that.returned this item and bought a Vista Certified Linksys USB	-1
This adapter works fine in my Vista PC , but it was a problem to install . The directions packaged with it are wrong for Vista , but you only find this out by scouring the information on Belkin 's web site ( and it is n't easy to find there ) . The real problem with it is that it seems to require more power than some USB ports provide . For example , on my PC , a usb port in which a flash drive works just fine ca n't even see the Belkin adapter . You need either a powered hub or a port that has plenty of juice flowing through it . As many , many posts on the web note , the Belkin tech support is worse than useless . I have n't even heard back from them on my report . All that said , the product does work ; I 've had no drops or other problems . In fact , I do run an older Belkin wireless adapter on a second PC ( under XP ) , and the older one sometimes has a problem connecting to the router , whereas the new one under Vista seems to connect without a hitch .	-1
I purchased a Belkin Model FBTOO1 version 2 Bluetooth adapter and attempted to install it on my system . When I had problems configuring the adapter , I called Belkin Tech Support , where I was told that if I had Windows XP Service Pack 2 installed , they would n't help me . Their device was not designed for Service Pack 2 . Their solution : uninstall service pack 2 . Obviously , that is not an acceptable solution . So I 'm stuck with this adapter that I ca n't use . Belkin wo n't replace it , I ca n't return it to the place where I purchased it because it 's open . So , my solution : Learn from this . Do n't buy Belkin products . They have absolutely no care or concern for you , the consumer .	-1
I do not care for this sticky pad at all . It 's far too large to actually fit on anything in my car , and it always sticks to itself ( i.e . folds in half and takes two hands to unstick/unfold ) . Although any piece of dirt or lint nearby sticks to this pad like a champ , my cell phone just slides right off . I would not recommend this product .	-1
This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made . One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad . Unfortunately , the pad moves all around .	-1
Ended up sending them back . They were very uncomfortable on my head with no padding at all . The sound was okay , nothing amazing . Not that I really cared , but the adapter piece shown very clearly did n't arrive with the product , so if you are expecting that you may end up without it . Would look elsewhere if I were you . The cord was insanely long , as if you could walk around the room wired , kind of weird ... .. Anyway , not worth purchasing .	-1
I 'm sure it would work well somewhere , just not for our small business . I put it behind an ADSL router and used it to authenticate PPPoE . It was a bear to get it set up this way and when it finally was , it worked for about 2 weeks and then just disconnected . After hours on the phone with tech support from Linksys and the DSL Router people , nobody could help . While it connected , it did work very well , it just did stay up . Too Bad .	-1
I 've used Amazon for a decade now and almost never post a negative review.I bought this to allow VPN but to also consolidate a DSL and Cable incoming connection . I was never able to get it to work properly with my modems and my wireless routers on opposite sides of this thing . Connections to the outside world would get confused about where they were coming from one moment to the next . The whole experience was world 's worse than I thought , and I never even got to the point of trying the VPN which sounds like it does n't work quite right either .	-1
I sent this unit back and got the RV082 which works fine.The QuickVPN refused to work with this unit and LinkSys was no help.It does not support the Native VPN Client in XP either.I got the RV082 and use the Native XP VPN client . No extra software and works like a charm .	-1
i regret the acquisition of this waste of time . it fails to accept files from either windows or osx if the filename is longer than a ridiculously short default , it 's as slow as molasses , and it 's bloody noisy to boot . also buffalo technical support is pathetic.mine is for sale once i wipe its disk ...	-1
SORRY TO SAY NOT HAPPY WITH THIS . DID N'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY CAR CD PLAYER WAS EJECTED OUT LIKE A CD . I PAID $ 8-9 DOLLARS AND DID N'T WORK . I PUT A CHEAP ONE IN AND IT STAYED IN CD AND PLAYED THE MUSIC ON CD CLEANER .	-1
Netgear should be ashamed , this product does not work . Does not connect to my cable modem , does not connect to my router , does not connect to my network . Oh , and the 24/7 tech support they promise , what a joke , there is no one available to respond via the 'free ' email tech support and if you want phone support , you have to pay for 'premium support services'These units are getting returned to Amazon first thing in the morning . Netgear looses another customer for life . Buyer beware ! !	-1
you need 2 of them , one to plug in and connect to router and other to plug in whatever . waste of money in my opinion . dissapointed	-1
It seems the shipper has not learned that you must put padding in large boxes with small heave dense items as they will surely flop around and break when shipped . This is twice I have ordered and twice this was done . They will not get a third chance .	-1
The charger is excellent , but you may want to think about getting different batteries . These batteries are complete junk and considering the power they contain , run out very quickly . I had this for a short while and purchased extra batteries and almost all are useless . I would recommend seeking an alternative product .	-1
Tired of paying through the nose for these proprietary format batteries that deliver far less power than what is available out there in standard battery sizes ? Well , make your own battery ! It turns out that this particular battery , designed to replace the dreadful OEM Panasonic P-P511 battery ( a NiCad 850mAH battery ) , is pretty easy to build yourself , as long as you are somewhat handy with arts and crafts . You do n't have to know too much about electronics to build this battery.First of all , save the original P-P511 battery that came with your phone . Study it . The P-P511 battery is essentially made of three AA batteries linked together in series . Linking batteries in series just requires that the minus pole of one battery contact the positive pole of the next battery , and so on . These links can be made by using wires or strips of metal.Take an Exacto knife or something similar and cut/peel away the outer plastic wrap of the battery . The bottom part of this old battery will have a hard plastic frame that holds the three AA batteries together . Save this plastic frame for re-use.Next , note how the original three AA batteries are linked together . The alignment of the three batteries is such that the one on the left will have the minus pole down , the one in the middle will also have the minus pole down , and the one on the right will have the positive pole down . The plastic holder has two holes , one in the middle , and one on the right side to allow the middle battery 's minus pole to contact the handset 's spring leads , and the right side battery 's positive pole to contact the handset 's spring leads.OK , so now all you 've got to do is figure out how to hook up the batteries in series so that these two battery poles end up at each end of this daisy chain series.Take heavy duty packing tape and some heavy duty aluminum foil ( the kind that comes in the large heavy duty lengths work fine ) , and cut small 1/4 inch strips . Tape the end of one such aluminum strip to the minus pole of what will be the left hand battery . Run this aluminum strip flush along the body of the left battery to the other end of the battery , and tape the other end of the aluminum strip to the positive pole of the middle battery.Next , tape these two batteries to the plastic frame holder and cover up the aluminum foil generously with some of the packing tape . The next aluminum strip needs to run directly over the positive pole of the middle battery without making any electrical contact with it , so the positive pole of this middle battery needs to be well covered with tape and insulated.So , tape down one end of a strip of aluminum foil to the top minus pole of the right hand battery , and run the foil strip across the top of the middle battery , and make contact with the bare positive pole of the left hand battery . Tape dowm the aluminum foil to the top of the left hand battery.Tape the right hand battery to the other two batteries and the frame , and then wrap the whole group of three batteries in tape again , just to make sure the whole thing stays together.Voila ! You 've made your own P-P511 battery ! The reason for doing all of this is of course that the technology for NiMH batteries has far outstripped what is being offered in this battery here ( only 1200 mAH ! ) , and you can make yourself a far better battery.The batteries that I used were Everyready Energizer 2500 mAH NiMH type . Way better than the original , way better than this Everyready ER-P511 ! Addendum - the best NiMH batteries at holding a charge that I 've found are the Eneloops by Sanyo . The Energizer NiMH batteries I originally mentioned above turned out to have this bad tendency to lose their charge after a few months . Thanks to the comment by Casey for reminding me to update this review .	-1
I bought two of these in and used them in different phones . In about 6 months they both would not hold a charge for more than 10 minutes of talk time . I have never experienced anything like this in a NMH rechargeable battery . They worked when I first got them and they did fit the way they were supposed to so I gave them 2 stars . Not sure it matters but they did not look like the picture . They said energizer but had an all black wrapping . These really smell like counterfeits to me . I ca n't believe the Everready company would risk damaging their brand with a product like this .	-1
I bought this battery to replace the original battery in a phone . These new batteries lasted less than a year . I do not recomend .	-1
I 'm generally a fan of Coby in the cheap radio market , but this one was disappointing.The radio did n't work first try , but it did after I removed and re-installed the batteries . Then I found that the `` Off '' button did n't work . I pressed it a couple dozen times and it finally went off , but I had to press it really hard . The tuning knob was so far off center that the ribbing around the knob grated on the case at some places on the dial . Even though the radio has `` feet '' it wobbled . The battery door was loose.FM performance was good . AM performance was bad with a lot of noise rough buzzing . I did n't get much on shortwave , but it was daytime and I would n't expect much . The tiny tuning knob was next to impossible to tune for shortwave , and the tuning light was mostly useless.So it 's OK for a digital readout FM radio , but if that 's all you want , I 'd go with theCoby CX50 Compact AM/FM Radio with Digital Display , silver .	-1
I understand that you should n't expect a lot from the radio that lists under $ 15 but I believe that manufacturer should deliver on the basic functionality . None of the short wave bands works , all you get is a lot of static and some distorted FM transmissions ( yes , on SW band ) . Also , I 've noticed that the the frequency bands do n't follow standard convention , which could make some of them pretty useless ( if they were working ) .I own several portable AM/FM/SW radios and , although some of them have better SW reception than others , I 've never had an item that claims SW coverage but has none.On the positive note , AM/FM seems to be OK .	-1
First , my cable only came with one ferrite core on one of the ends of the cable . Second , I had bought this so that I could replace an older analog cable that had ghosting and blurriness . But lo and behold , this cable was even worse the original cable I sought to replace ! I immediately put in for a return/refund . I 'm not sure whether I just got a bad cable or whether the general populace simply does not have an eye for visual quality or both , but nevertheless I am writing this review so that others do n't have to deal with this scam.Also to add is that this cable only has 3 resolutions : 800x600 , 1024x768 , and 1280x720 . This is just a cheap and lazy way to cover all screen aspects without actually detecting the proper resolution for the screen size .	-1
Like many here I purchased this VGA cable with the expectation of connecting a laptop to an HDTV . Since I could n't wait for the cable to arrive soon enough I purchased one locally from Fry 's Electronics ( for more than twice the price + tax ) . The Fry 's cable has worked well and aside from the price I have no real problem with it.That said , I received my Amazon order today from HDE and immediately noticed some significant issues:1 . The cable gauge ( diameter ) was noticeably thinner.2 . While the product illustration displays `` ferrites '' ( 2 ) one on either connector and the description mentions `` ferrites '' ( plural ) several times , the cable only arrived with one ferrite on one connector.3 . One of the connector retaining screws is slightly bent and will not align through both holes on the connector , it 's virtually useless.4 . Cable length was measurably shorter as well . Both cables are described as 10 ' long . The Fry 's cable measures 9'-11 '' and the Cables to Go measures 9'-5 '' .5 . When comparing picture quality , the Cables to Go comes up short here too . As several others here have described , picture quality ranged from `` snowy '' to noticeably `` fuzzy '' and most definitely inferior.Sometimes there is no way to know if you are buying a `` bargain '' or just getting short changed . In this case the `` Cables to Go 10 ' SVGA '' cable is going to go ... right back .	-1
Ordered two of these cables- they are missing one of the pins and will not work on my new computer . It 's not worth it to ship them back , ( and I paid for expedited shipping ) . Oh well we live and learn . Check before you buy ! !	-1
I purchased this for use inside of a data center to hold some cat 6 cables in place . It worked great for about a month . The issue is that the hook side and loop side of this product is glued together . The adhesive that holds those to side together seems to give up and the 2 halves of the wrap actually separate . The end result is that you have a piece of hook and another piece of loop . Without them both together , it 's useless . Perhaps this would work in a less demanding environment , but not in an air-conditioned data center . I expected better from a Cables 2 Go product . Next time I 'll be spending the extra money for something from Panduit . Very disappointing .	-1
Have tried more than 25 blanks from one pack ; every one is defective . ( Would n't you think I 'd have stopped after 10 ? Some people are forever hopeful . ) Tried both computer burner and external drive . Computer jammed several times and external drive locked up , and I had to force eject both . Even tried one from the middle of the stack , it jammed , too . Most made a grinding sound like they are mis-shapen - 1 star . Peculiarity is , I bought a second pack at the same time , and it is fine - 5 stars.I have used these discs several times before and they were close to perfect , a good value for the price . But one mega-failure has me moving to another brand for now.Because Amazon fulfilled this order for an outside company , Amazon wo n't process a refund or replacement . I have to pack up and return the CDs , request a refund and jump through a couple of hoops for a 'maybe you can get a refund . ' Some things are n't worth the work . I 'll drop a note to Philips and ask for a coupon . The worst they can say is no.-Patricia	-1
I opened my box , camera was scratched on lcd viewer , was supposed to be NEW condition ... then after reading instructions , found that it would not function unless the batteries were like new..took to soccer match as I shoot a lot of sports pics ... well , would not focus clearly at all at over 100 yards..all my shots were blurred at this distance ... do not like the idea of no protector over the lcd viewer . ( also , nearly impossible to see in light ) .was obviously scratched in shipment as was sitting on it in the box..parts were not included in the box as stated on line ... talked with factory rep. told me it should be returned for service , etc..I am waiting on replacement from AMAZON an will see if it is any better , if not , will go back for a different brand , type , etc..	-1
Initially I liked and enjoyed the adapter . It allowed me to us a digital card to listen to music in the car . However , it no longer works and I will be exchanging it .	-1
My toshiba modem broke after a year and this one looked cool so i got it . Worked fine for about a week , then could n't hold a signal for more than a day . Lost connection then I 'd Unplug wait and plug back in . You know the drill . work , stop . over and over.Replaced it with a motorola surfboard . A full year later and never a single drop . Not the computer , same connection , problem was clearly the modem.Cheers	-1
How much can I emphasize that I wish we HAD NEVER PURCHASED THIS SYSTEM ? Purchasing a radio from a dollar store would be a better investment . This unit is the result of poor manufacturing and will provide you with poor performance . I 'd give it no stars if that were an option.We have had our new Bose system hooked up for about two months . One major complaint is the lack of a headphone jack . I have never heard of a stereo system without a headphone jack . We were updating all of our components and purchased a new Sony DVD Recorder/VHS and a new DirecTV DVR with Tivo . We were trying to pair down our equipment . Turns out , none of these components have a headphone jack . All of these newer components are being produced without headphone jacks , which left us in quite a pickle . Fortunately , we found a company called `` Ramsey Electronics '' which provides a headphone amplifier with audio cables to allow us to hook our headphones through the Ramsey unit and then into the Bose unit . It set us back $ 80.Next , we had the dilemma with the remote . The Tivo remote wo n't work with Bose , though it did work with my 12 year old Pioneer sound system . Then , I spent another $ 100 on a decent learning remote that could control all of my components , but I 'd rather use the Tivo remote.As irritating as that was , the most irritating thing about the Bose unit is that the audio/video plugs do not stay plugged in . They are all kind of `` loose . '' We bought new , expensive A/V cables , thinking that would solve the problem . We 've tried everything to remedy this problem , including pushing the unit up against the back wall of our entertainment center in order to keep the plugs from falling out . I ca n't tell you how disheartening it is to be in the middle of a movie with a $ 1300 Bose sound system and just have the sound go OUT because one of the plugs fell out of its socket . It 's not a tension issue , either . It 's poor manufacturing.Even more flawed is the DVD disc tray . First , there is NO eject button on the remote , then when you press the eject button on the unit , it will just say `` Opening ... '' Nothing happens ! Then , when you press it again , it just says `` Closing ... '' Nothing happens . My husband had to `` teach '' me that if you push the eject button in rapid succession , you can sometimes get it to open . That 's just swell for a $ 1300 investment . I have a DVD player in the guest room that I paid $ 29.99 for and it opens and closes its disc tray , no problem . Go figure . Fortunately , for us , we have the Sony DVD Recorder/Player and use it when the Bose is being `` temperamental . '' We 've only been able to successfully watch 3 DVDs using the Bose because the tray wo n't open.Also , it sounds NOTHING like it does in the store . I do n't know if they have some special demo disc or what , but our 12 year old Pioneer system had far superior sound . We 've never owned a Bose unit before and thought we were stepping up to purchase this one . I think we stepped way down . Also , how can a company that manufactures headphones-not make any units with a headphone jack ? That makes no sense , at all . To inform me in the literature that I will `` lose sound quality '' by plugging my Bose headphones into a `` non-Bose '' component must be some sort of joke . The Bose units do n't have a headphone jack , what else am I supposed to plug them into ? I am confused about this . I 've always been told that Bose is the leader in sound components , but this headphone issue is just a lack of good common sense and the shotty manufacturing of the plugs and disc tray have caused me an enormous amount of stress and regret.Save yourself money , time , regret , and stress by finding a different system . This one will only test your sanity in regards to the $ 1300 you spent on this piece of junk !	-1
I had a Bose Lifestyle System and was very happy with the quality and depth of the sound . I played Cd 's , DVD 's , and my TV through it and it was impressive especially with DVD 's and the fact it was not surround sound . Bought the Bose 321 system and was disappointed ... . The sound is thin and frail , no depth . This system just does not have the impact and sound I was hearing from my Lifestyle System . It is not worth the money because you can buy other systems at half the price that have a better overall sound ... I have no reliability issues with the unit , just disappointed in the sound . If you are listening to less expensive units that have a boomy muddy bass then this will be a step up but if you are looking for depth of sound and great sound separation from acoustic type music this is not the system you want ... The DVD 's sound loud and clear , very little difference than playing through the Lifestyle system and do n't have that wow impact I was hoping for ... . The Bass unit is not impressive ... JUST DISAPPOINTED ! ! !	-1
I bought this system four months ago . I 'm not happy with my purchase for the following reasons:1 ) sound constantly drops off2 ) you have to turn the volume WAY up to get the full `` surround effect '' 3 ) systems mysteriously shuts down on its own4 ) DVD picture is not good as a stand-alone DVD player5 ) Limited options and inputs6 ) expensive and over-priced for what you get.My verdict ... save your money and buy another system .	-1
These replacements ( I bought 3 in 2009 ) started to fail after only 3 1/2 years.Looking back , I should have just bought new phones instead.BTW , the original batteries that came with phone lasted 8 years .	-1
Just do n't buy it . Three coloured small papers for $ 12 is just rediculus . Its too small when framed with your subject while shooting . It 's paper and not durable at all . Can not be used for monitor calibration as some ppl may think , you would need a proper calibration equipment if you wish to do so , because the idea of the caliboration is not to depend on your eye evaluation for colour matching . For $ 25 you could get a much better folding plastic cards .	-1
i never purchased aerosol products , but i needed to clean my laptop . i learned the hard way when i found out 12 oz of this stuff is enough to clean a computer one time.so this is a bad deal , it is best to buy in bulk because i can not spend 15 bucks to clean my laptop one time .	-1
It says air and propellant but it 's not it is a GAS . I was looking for cheap compressed air and end up buying GAS unknowingly .	-1
I bought these to mount Definitive Tech Promonitor speakers.As another user mentioned their wood screws are terrible . I had 3 screws whose head sheered when tightening them.Additionally , the part that screws to the speaker broke . As I was tightening the screw that holds the bracket onto the speaker , bracket snapped in half.These were of such poor quality that I am actually glad that they broke now rather than later . I 'd hate to have them snap while holding up a speaker .	-1
This is a horrible unit and should be recalled . I bought this thinking it would be a good , versitile product and suitable for future use . What a mistake . I began having disc freezes and tray locks after about 5 weeks . Sproradic at first , then worse and worse . Now after 3 months it is dead and the official Sony warranty IS INVALID ! ! ! I have to pay $ 33 to get a replacment unit from Texas , which may be a refurbished one with the same problems . Hard to believe is n't it ! ? Go to the Sony support site and see for yourself . You do n't need to have one , no need for a serial number or anything . Just go through the process of acting like you have a problem . The support process will end saying your unit is NOT eligible for ( local ) service ( ! ) and your only choice is to return it , freight pre-paid , plus another $ 33 to get a replacement , which may/may not be new . Do a web search on all the other poor comsumers who bought this piece of junk and you 'll see it is a widespread problem . I have trashed this dead Sony unit after only 3 months . Why pay $ 33+ for more garbage ? I will buy a JVC or Panasonic ; maybe Denon . I 'll never buy from Sony again . The JVC XVN512 is looking pretty good and has comparable features .	-1
I was very impressed by the audio and video this unit provided for me . However am very disappointed with the quality of the hardware . After only 6 months the unit started acting up ... door would n't open at first then it just started shutting off at random . Tried all Sony 's proposed solutions to no avail . Had to send the unit back ( pay for my own shipping ) and am still waiting ( over a week now ) for the `` replacement '' unit , which I fear will go south on me too . It 's really to bad since the unit truly is impressive ( when it worked ) .Based on all the other similar complaints i would think Sony would want to provide an exchange program or recall and save some face with there customer base .	-1
but one major con to me is that this recorder lacks compatibility to record/play DVD-RAM discs which personally I believe is the best format for recording TV . It allows you to `` chase playback '' , meaning you can watch something on it while it 's recording ! ( both previously recorded or currently being recorded ) . You can jump to any spot on the disc and begin playing or recording right away - even arrange recorded programs for playback in any order you choose . What a cool feature ! DVD-RAM discs can be copied to & erased up to 100K times . DVD-RAM is found on recorders from some toshiba , samsung , jvc , and most panasonics and I believe it 's popularity will grow as more people learn of it 's capabilities.The plus format is not as commonly found as the minus is . In fact , I 've only seen it supported as far as recorders are concerned from sony . Perhaps that means it 's a dying format , I do n't know . I hate to have to give sony a `` bad '' review because I do love their electronics-they are a quality brand , however the lack of DVD-RAM support means I 'll be buying another brand . Also tell me how such an expensive recorder from sony does n't also include an HDMI output and SACD playback ? ? ? Also lacks firewire port which is very surprising considering most of the DVD recorders on the market have it . Also lacks JPEG & WMA support . sorry sony you lose !	-1
2nd bulb in 3 years , this time the replacement bulb does n't work . Faxed them a copy of the receipt for the extended warranty replacement bulb that did n't work , checked back 5 days later to find out why we do n't have a lamp yet , Toshiba could n't read my fax and did n't bother to call me at the number in bold felt-tipped pen on the fax . Locally , they 're out of stock , and we ca n't get a replacement for another week . DO NOT BUY THIS TV . I was told that LCD is the way to go because plasmas burn out after 4 years and there 's no way to repair them . DLP bulbs cost $ 230 every time they burn out .	-1
Before signing and accepting delivery of any Toshiba DLP , be sure to check the screen to make sure that the coating on the inside of the screen is uniform . On mine , there was a circle about 10 '' in diameter that you can see in certain lighting and even when the TV is off ! It will appear lighter than the surrounding areas at times and can be annoying . I called Toshiba and had a service man come out and even though he acknowledged that this is common , Toshiba will not replace the screen . I would have given them a negative 10 if it were possible just because of their attitude . So , look at the screen VERY carefully before accepting or purchasing . If you see this problem , refuse to accept it . Or else just buy a Samsung or Mitsubishi DLP to avoid the problem I have .	-1
I recently purchased these disks from Amazon , but these blanks are horrible ! Out of 3 first disks that I burned all 3 had corrupt data . I burned the first at 8x , and the other two at 4x . After burning Nero does verification , and it failed on all 3 disks . I included a CRC checking files on the disks as well , and they also failed . I was using LG GSA 4163B writer to burn these disks.Conclusion : There are cheap things that work less efficiently , and there are cheap things that just do Not work at all . This media falls into the `` do not work at all '' category .	-1
Audio playback through this extension is terrible -- constant static . I have used it with multiple sources and playback devices , speakers and headphones , and all have the same result , static . Replaced it with a higher quality cable and the problem was solved . Not worth the hassle of trying to get a replacement when the cable only cost $ 3 shipped to begin with .	-1
This is the 2nd right angle coax adapter I have purchased through Amazon . This one lasted not even 24 hours . We run a cable modem through this for the internet and phone - 35Mb/s down and 5Mb/s up . When first installed the internet connection and phone worked at full spec speeds , however after one evening of light use , the next day there was no signal coming through at all . The connector itself was not moved or tampered with in any way.. it just stopped working . This is not the first time either . The previous one also worked when first installed , but in less than a day the bandwidth was too small for the internet to work , although the phones still worked for an hour or two longer , then even that stopped working . In both cases , removing the adapter fixed the connectivity issue immediately . I see from other reviews I am not the only one with this issue ( far from it ) . I do n't know why it is so hard to make a simple adapter , but apparently it is . One star . I 'd give zero if I could .	-1
Good for movies , This subwoofer is mainly for BOOM BOOM BOOM SHAKE SHAKE SHAKE.It gives good effects on action movies and such , But if you are looking for controlled , fine , tight , quality bass , LOOK AWAY ! I give 2 stars for the price and built quality.It is quite big as well , So , beware if you are looking for something small.Q ) Would I recommend this to others ? A ) NO ! I 'd really like to return this , but I brought this to Guatemala and will probably cost more to return lol , I will have to use it for a while.Also , there is this annoying rattling sound when it reaches certain level of frequency.There is couple of other reviews mentioning this problem , it could be a defect.May be I was expecting too much from high ratings~I will definitely buy another subwoofer when I have chance and throw this away .	-1
Polk makes great speakers ( LSi series ) , good speakers ( RTi series ) , ok speakers ( Monitor series ) , and mediocre speakers ( R series ) . But like most speaker manufacturers , their subs are horrible for the money . Why ? Because they are betting that if you are already buying their speakers , you 'll likely want to buy one of their subs too , especially if some slimey and/or ignorant salesperson tells you that you MUST `` match '' the sub and speakers.Of course , those of us who know something about audio know that aside from a few rare exceptions ( like Magnepan planar speakers which really require a super-quick musical subwoofer ) there is ABSOLUTELY NO SUCH THING as `` subwoofer-matching '' -- -just get the best-sounding sub you can afford . The best bang-for-your buck subs are made by the two dominant Internet-direct subwoofer specialists , Hsu and SVS.This PSW10 is a prime example . If you are in a small room and listening to jazz or rock music , it 's not too bad . Use it while blasting hip-hop , or watching a special-effects loaded movie like `` Jurassic Park '' or `` Fellowship of the Ring '' and you wo n't even know it 's there -- -it simply does not go low enough nor loud enough ( let 's not even talk about if it 's clean enough ) to do the job . The only worse mass-market subs I 've ever heard would be the Sony and Yamaha subs ; the Infinity subs are slightly better.For this price range you can do much better looking at the 12 '' Dayton subwoofer from [ ... ] which goes for under a hundred fifty dollars shipped .	-1
I ordered this unit to complement the pair of Polk Audio Monitor 60 speakers I already own to which the unit bears a stylistic resemblance . I assume that the subwoofer was the work of the same design team that did the Monitor 60 . I love the sound of the Monitor 60s . It 's sweet , understated , yet solid and convincing , good for reproducing classical music . This comment is from a guy who spent six months making the rounds from dealer to dealer looking for the perfect grand piano.This unit was extensively reviewed , with generally good ratings and seemed like a good choice for a budget subwoofer . Unfortunately , when I plugged it in it exhibited a noticeable line a/c hum . After some analysis , I concluded that this noise has two components : a vibration from the power supply transformer that seems to be amplified by the enclosure , and hum from the woofer itself . This hum seems to come from residual line a/c hum that the power supply was not able to completely filter out . The 60 Hz fundamental seems to be OK ; the noiseI contacted Polk Audio customer support ; they were attentive and responsive , and sent me a replacement amplfier . Unfortunately the new amp had the same behaviors.The hum is barely audible at 10 ft away when the system is idling . I thought long and hard whether I could live with and decided to return the unit . I purchased a used Yamaha YST-SW215 . It is smaller , and loses a few of the lowest notes to the PSW10 , but it 's absolutely quiet .	-1
I made a huge mistake buying this Polk PSW10 '' 50 watt powered subwoofer from at anywhere between $ 89 and $ 129 depending on when you buy it . When buying your first true powered sub you have nothing to compare it to so all these 5 star reviews are just exaggerated from lack of knowledge base and just basic lack of comparison.I 'm not trying to be mean , I 'm just being very honest since this is most likely the first powered entry level powered sub that the reviewer has purchased . There is one quick and easy test you can do to hear the abnormal amount of front port noise that the Polk PSW10 produces . Just play PinkFloyds `` TheDarkSideOfTheMoon '' re-mastered CD and play the beginning of the CD with the bass volume up to a decent level , nothing extreme . Now just listen and get ready to be shocked into returning your Polk PSW10 ! That 's it a quick and simple no argument test that anyone can do at home and will show the true weakness of having a cheaply ported sub . After all the port is a cardboard tube that 's not even flared . Tons and tons of front port noise that will ruin music from the very get go ! Now the Polk 505 is a decent seller as well and also suffers from extreme rear slot port noise ! So Polk subs in general or at least there older designs suffer greatly from front and rear port noise . Now some of there new very expensive powered subs use a passive radiator to eliminate the port noise ! But we are talking about $ 1,000 powered subs ! So I 'll will suggest that instead of going with Polk you have a few different options for either a very cost effective powered sub or a very high end sub at a relatively good price.So we have the Dayton Audio 1000 10 '' 100 watt powered sub that just destroys the Polk PSW10 in every way . It almost eliminates port noise by using a bottom flared port design used in more expensive subs . This sub sells for only $ 110 to $ 120 at PartExpress . Keep in mind this Dayton Audio sub came out of no where really quick . It 's a brand new ultra modern sub design with a bottom flared port that just about eliminates all port noise . It 's also equipped with a 100 watt RMS amplifier that 's twice the power of the Polk PSW10 that everyone is raving about ! Then you have the Dayton Audio 1200 12 '' 120 watt powered sub . This was my first PolkPSW10 '' sub replacement and is probably the best bang for the buck you will ever find in a powered subwoofer with a real ( LFE ) port in both the 10 '' and the 12 '' ! L.F.E . stands for Low Frequency Effects and is a usually run from your receivers back sub output to the powered subs LFE RCA input that 's crossed over where ever you set up your receiver according to your front speaker size and frequency response ! So I have been running a Dayton Audio 12 '' 120 watt 44 LB monster with my Definitive Studio Monitor 450 's that just love a lot of clean power ! This low cost but high performing powered sub form the no name company called Dayton Audio is just a unreal deal in powered sub performance at only $ 140 ! ! I know it sounds impossible and trust me I thought the same exact way until I listened to this baby very closely with my all analog Carver C-1 Preamp , my Hafler 255 watt per channel amplifier and a Marantz CD-6004 at $ 400 is the best CD player for the money on the market in my opinion ! I know $ 400 for a CD player ? Right I get it but it 's the only music playback unit I have running thru the Carver C-1 preamp other than a Carver TX-2 mint condition tuner ! So it 's a very important piece of equipment and the most I have ever spent on any stereo component with the Carver C-1 in a close second place.So am I keeping this Dayton sub ? Well with this very high end stereo setup it really does show a few of the Dayton 's 12 '' subs weaknesses . That said it cost me between $ 500 and $ 550 to find a better sub that was worth buying and once again it 's from a relatively unknown speaker company that makes some great speakers but is not a huge name as of yet . SVS makes some wonderful powered subs that vary from $ 500 to $ 2,000 and are all considered some of the best powered subs you can buy ! The Sunfire 12 '' 300 watt powered sub is also a very excellent sub if space is not a issue ! Then there is the Definitive Super Cube 4000 at $ 700 with a 8 '' main driver and two 8 '' passive radiators one on each side and a 1,200 watt amplifier . The Def Tech was listed last due to it 's high cost . However , you can pick up a refurbished unit that 's like new with a 3 month warranty for only $ 530 ! All five of these powered subs are great and the two Dayton Audio subs set a record for most bang for the buck by a large margin ! Try one you will not be disappointed with one of them as your entry level sub no matter which size fit 's your room.The $ 500 and up subs are also all just about the same in playback quality with a slight edge going to the Super Cube 4000 with it 's remote control and special digital filters for very , very low end response that the others could not quite match.However , with a 3 month warranty it 's a slight gamble with it 's single auto On/Off signal sensor ! Personally , although I have a all Definitive speaker setup the Super Cube 4000 was not on my list due to the single power On/Off signal switch . It just seems that since I 'll be changing inputs from music to the ( LFE ) port for movies a separate On/Off switch would be a lot more likely to last for several years.Also both the SVS 1000 12 '' 300 watt and the Sunfire 12 '' 300 watt Bash amp powered subs are both given 5 year warranty 's with the SVS you have a 45 day free trial and you can send it back within 45 days and get a full refund including the return shipping fee ! Now how do you beat that ? You simply can't.So in closing for a good entry level sub for average sounding speakers setup mainly for movies the Dayton Audio powered subwoofers ca n't be beat at even twice there cost ! For those looking for a really great sub for music as the primary source the SVS , Sunfire and Definitive Super Cube 4000 are all good choices for $ 500 to $ 555 ! Personally , I just do n't see a performance to cost ratio above this price point that worth pursuing ! I 'm quite sure there are better subs at $ 1,000 and up but I certainly will not be paying that kind of money for a powered sub that only plays about 10 % of the very low end of the frequency spectrum . For me just about $ 550 is about all I can afford to spend on my budget as a Computer Tech.Hope this helped out some folks that were undecided or just flat out new to powered subs the way my internet forum pal really helped me out by first mentioning the name of Dayton Audio to me and then convincing me to give a no name powered sub a fair chance.I give you my word as a total Computer and audio geek , so to speak , that all the information I just provided is as honest and without any biased notions . I tell it like it is and not because I bought one or tried one out , but because I remember when I was new to the powered subs and had no clue about how bad port noise effects musical playback and how once you hear it , there is absolutely no way you will accept a sub at any price that puts out the port noise that the Polk PSW10 and Polk 505 will produce during music playback .

There aint nothing Anti-Static about this product , It 's no better than Pledge ! It does clean pretty well , but you 'll be dusting again in 2 days ( Especially if you live in a farming area or construction zones )	-1
For some reason , it worked with an older LCD TV I had , but not my new 58inch Samsung plasma that I got .	-1
I hooked this cable up to my cable box and everytime i change the channel , it cuts out for 3-5 seconds and then comes back on . this is very annoying since I do n't plan to stay on one channel the whole time . For the price i guess its nice , but i 'd rather pay a few extra bucks for a good cable , not this lackluster one	-1
There is no reason to pay $ 20 or even $ 10 for a 6 ' HDMI cable . I have been purchasing very good quality cables on line for $ 2 to $ 3 . Thought I would try these . Wasted my time and money . I ordered 3 and none worked ( my old cables worked fine ) . These things are clearly junk . I recommend you look some place else . There are lots of better cables at not much more money . Can not recommend these !	-1
Poor connection , no signal . I do not advise buying this product . I am going to spend a little more money to ensure a better cable .	-1
I bought these cables since they were cheap . I was n't able to see if they were 1.3 certified . I wish I bought 1.3 cables now.I want to now buy 1.3c cables that my tv supports so I can get a better picture .	-1
I know , I know ... You dont have to spend $ 40 on a cable . The $ 1.00 ones work just fine . Well , thats tru and not true . On some tvs , blu ray players etc they will work fine . But some of them will not . I bought 2 and learned the hard way . Both did not work . But in the past I had bought a cheap one that works great . So just beware . Because I didnt use them until after 60 days , I couldnt get a refund from these guys even though they do not work with my equipment . I would rather buy the amazon basics brand for $ 9.99 from now on which I did . At least if there is a problem in the long run you have a better chance of getting a new one or a refund .	-1
Way too cheap ( quality ) . I bought a couple and they did n't last 6 months with very little plugging and un-plugging .	-1
I bought this HDMI cable and it broke on me within 6 months of use . I would not recommend this item to anyone who needs an HDMI cable	-1
The cable I bought had audio problems with my Ps3 . I was really disappointed when it stopped working because the price of this was so cheap .	-1
just plugged it in , nada nothing zero.. used my shorter HDMI bought from local store , and no problem.. its the cable , , and I bought two ... you get what you pay for .	-1
not sure why , but this cable did n't work for any of my hdmi devices on any of my TVs . Next time I 'm buying amazon 's label .	-1
This cable developed a short in it about two years after I purchased it . I knew it had a lifetime warranty ( the main reason I went with this company ) so I thought 'no problem , I can get it replaced ' . When I first contacted SF Planet they replied with : '' Thank you for getting back to us.Unfortunately , it is already over the 30 days warranty and return period.Sorry for the inconvenience that may cause.Please let me know if you have further questions . `` Once I explained to them this product was advertised as having a lifetime warranty , they replied with this : '' Thank you for getting back to us.Please follow the instructions and send it back for a warranty exchange : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -WARRANTY/EXCHANGE AUTHORIZATION SLIPRMA : WEXD-xxxxxxxxxxxxxReturn Due Date : xxxxxxxxxx -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -IMPORTANT : Please print this and enclose it in the return package.Return Policy : - Please write the RMA # on the return package for identification purposes.- Please include payment , in money order / check / cash , of $ 3 for the warranty exchange fee . Please make it payable to : SF PLANET- All return or exchange packages should arrive before the Return Due Date.- To save on shipping , please send the return via USPS Mail ( or UPS/FedEx/DHL ) , '' Let 's see now.. the cable costs $ 1.69 and they want a $ 3 `` warranty fee '' PLUS I eat the cost to ship it to them ... . Seems like a good way to get the customer to just buy another one . Which is exactly what I am going to do , just not from them .	-1
HDMI cable worked good for about a week . Then , I had audio but no picture . Pressed `` input '' button , picture returned . Only to fade out again in 2 minutes . Changed to another brand cable , problem solved .	-1
You may want to find a better HDMI cable for serious use . My computer to an HD LCD TV would not even recognize this cable . My PS3 to an HD LCD TV would only recognize this cable up to 720P . I do have a Blu-ray player to an HD LCD TV , and this cable seems to work fine for this setup , so that is where this cable will stay . I 've bought other HDMI cables for around ten dollars that have great quality and will work on all my devices . This one for under three dollars my have been just a little too cheap . I recommend paying a little more and getting a better cable .	-1
Bought two of these cables to connect my Motorola ( Comcast ) cable box and my PS3 to my Samsung LN-52A650 . Worked well for the cable box ( 1080i ) , and the PS3 @ 1080i , but I got the dreaded `` Mode Not Supported '' message from the Samsung when the PS3 sent a 1080p signal . After a Samsung firmware update , the Samsung still would n't `` See '' the PS3 at 1080p . I went down to Target and picked up a Phillips cable ( 1.3b Cat 2 , also ) ... Now the Samsung connects to the PS3 without issue . I could recommend this cable for 1080i connections , but for the Samsung LN 52A650 , I would stay away .	-1
This broke after a few months of me using it . It 's a very cheaply made product and there are much better ones for only a few bucks more .	-1
There is a reason this cord is so dirt cheap . It DOES work , but when image is projected to the television , there is a distinct cloudyness all around the edges . Better of paying $ 40 for a cord that performs like it 's supposed to . Would not recommend to anyone .	-1
1st . They sent only one HDMI and one cord I have never seen before.2nd . The HDMI did not work . Nothing . Nada3rd . I returned both cables right away and have yet to hear anything back .	-1
This is a Type A to Type C cable ( regular to mini ) -- NOT what I needed . BE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED .	-1
I bought this to connect my Blue Ray player to my tv . It does not produce any signal at all . Like others , I wanted to save money . All I can say is that I learned a valuable lesson and it only cost me the price of this worthless cable , so I guess that 's a good deal . This is my first major disappointment with an Amazon product . I love Amazon , but will be more wary in the future .	-1
Order shipped 2 days via Amazon prime , cable works fine , have had for 90 days.For the price , highly recommend.Update : August 1 , 2012 - dropped from 5 to 3 stars.This cable stopped functioning and I had to replace it . I have mixed feelings . It only cost a couple bucks , but failed in less than 1 year . I feel it should have lasted longer , but at least I did n't spend $ 20.00 bucks on it . Looking for a more reliable alternative and have heard that Mono price cables are highly rated.Update : August 2 , 2012.Contacted SF Planet to get this exchanged . Original cable died . This item is listed as having a lifetime warranty , however , SF Planet says otherwise and only warranties this for 30 days . I have cables that I 've used for years and this one did n't even last 9 months .	-1
This item was a `` deal '' with the purchase of a ROKU . Poor quality cable not worth the money . Not shielded , lots of interference on equipment .	-1
Ordered the Verbatim 8.5GB 6X Double Layer DVD+R DL Disks ( 20pk Spindle ) and received 2.4x Speed DVD+R DL Disks instead . Amazon was nice enough to tell me to keep what was sent and told me they would send me a new order with the 6X speed . Guess What ! ! ! They again sent me the 2.4 speed disks . I would not recommend this purchase since the they still show that the disks are 6X speed on their web site and what you actually receive are the 2.4X Disks .	-1
Amazon is incorrectly advertising this as being able to be burned higher than 2.4X . That speed is the highest that is officially given on the label of the 50-Disc Spindle ( 96577 ) that I received . Verbatim does n't back any higher speeds.Otherwise , you risk getting coasters.From Verbatim when I contacted them : '' Thank you for contacting Verbatim Technical Support . Unfortunately , 96577 is not compatible with 6x speed , you can burn these discs with a max speed of 2.4x , we request you to kindly visit ( their website ) and check for the right model discs.Your case no is : 000xxxxxIf you need any further assistance please call us on : ( their phone number ) and we will be happy to assist you.Regards , Verbatim Technical SupportSo I say Please Check out the Verbatim specs for 96577 at their website before you purchase this from Amazon .	-1
I was really desperate for more speed on my PC . My processor speed is decent but I only ran 256 MB of RAM which is pathetic by today 's standards hence the reason I decided to get this 1GB stick from Kingston.So here I am all excited about adding more memory to my machine . The stick fits in perfectly . I put on my machine and what do I see ? ? ? ? The dreaded blue screen which quickly disappears ; then all the machine does is restart time and time again.I brought the RAM and my PC to my technician and he said that most likely the blue screen is because of a hardware malfunction , meaning the RAM was faulty . I was very disappointed seeing that there were so many satisfied customers who used this product . I guess I 'm the odd one out . I plan to upgrade once more but next time I 'll have to go with a company other that Kingston .	-1
These speakers may be GREAT ! But , I will never know , because the tweeter extends outside the grill ! It is not recessed ! It was not compatible with my installation .	-1
I would give 0 start if an option available.Mic : vibrates / noisy , not usable for chat or recordingSpeakers : okay	-1
My son has been using this headset without any problems on his desktop computer for about 6 months . Recently he took if along for a road trip to use it with his iPad . I did not notice any specific rough handling but he suddenly realized the smallest portion of the jack broke and got lodged in the iPad . There was no way it could be dislodged until we got home , after a lot of effort with pins and tweezers . Recommend the headset for more domestic use instead of rougher handling with portable electronics .	-1
I own an older Polk center speaker , which I bought after comparing it to other center speakers in the store . I 've had it a few years . I purchased this speaker based on reviews on Amazon.com . I expected great sound , based on its 5-star ratings . I was disappointed . Voices sounded tinny , with no fullness . This means poor bass response . The highs were clear , maybe too much treble . I requested a refund .	-1
Seems well made enough ( how tricky is it to make a ferrite collar ? ) , but the actual inside diameter is less than 1/4 '' , so I could n't use them because they would n't close around my cords . I contacted the seller and they sent replacements , but they were the exact same thing . If you do n't need the full 1/4 '' , you should be fine . If you do , look elsewhere.Edit : I 've been able to use some of these on some cheap HDMI cables I bought , so that 's cool .	-1
I went to `` easily snap '' onto my power cable on my tv and the 2 locking tabs broke off instantly . ( you can see them in the item picture ) Even without much force , these things are fragile . I ended up wrapping it on there with electrical tape . Still did n't solve my noise problem but I do n't think it 's this products fault . However , 1/4 '' should be 1/4 '' . The inside diameter seems just a hair smaller than 1/4 '' , enough to be an issue . Customers may want to purchase the 3/8 '' size instead to be safe .	-1
i bought 3 of these cables ... all 3 cables fit loose in there holes	-1
These cables are the definition of cheap . You have been warned . Stay away from this brand or else you will probably regret it .	-1
I was purchasing things for my new camera and thought this went with it ... under the section : people bought `` this and this '' with the product you are purchasing . I assumed that it was something I needed . Thank goodness it was inexpensive..I still have no clue what it 's for .	-1
This product did not fit my Vizio products as it was to small to remain connected . I bought a larger size identified through someones review stating it was to big for their unit and purchased it . Rocketfish worked for my Vizio , but as stated I heard others say Rocketfish was to large . Nice thing is a local large box competitor wants $ 17.99 for 4ft'er so still way ahead with my dual purchase .	-1
The last product I got at least said it was digital optical but this says fiber optic to 3.5mm mini adapter . When I first bought this product I instantly knew that it was n't used fire a 3.5mm headphone jack and I would also need two converters in order for me to use this product first I would need a digital optical toslink to 3.5mm mini OPTICAL adapter and need I would need a fiber optic toslink . It may say fiber optic toslink but until they change the mini adapter part to mini optical it can confuse others .	-1
This keyboard is for USB but the mouse is for PS/2 connect only . Laam-o ! I read a many reviews about this being `` cutting edge '' and `` smart '' but it 's dumb ! PS/2 ? cmon gim me a beak ! I 'll never trust another reveiw , not even Tom 's Hardware who odviously has Logitechs working with them !	-1
I 've had this camera for 13 months , and I 've been extremely happy with it for these 13 months . Very easy to use , with the `` scene modes '' ; AA batteries , so you never really have to worry about charging , because you can have a few batteries at hand ; never had to read the manual ; very good picture quality , upto 8x10 prints ; pops into any computer with USB.But then , one day , after these 13 months , the camera errors out with E18 . For all I can see , the camera is dead.Search the web for `` canon E18 '' , you 'll see that it is a fairly frequent problem , and there 's even a class action suit.13months for $ 300 , that 's not enough . My previous digical camera lasted 6 years . No more Canon compacts for me , I 'm trying another brand ...	-1
At first I thought this device would work for me , than I actually tried to use it . I found that the signal attenuation through this device was so great that some digital sources worked and some did n't . For the other side I should add that part of the problem is that the source device needs to have a better signal output , so the fault needs to be divided a bit in this case . The source device in this case is the Sangean HDT-1X , I purchased this precisely because it had a digital out put and wound up having to use the analog output .	-1
The Sender unit failed after about one year of operation . The image became erratic sending a good image for 1/2 second after one minute of garbage . The sender is locked to channel 1 , unable to settle on the other channels , no matter how many times the channel select is clicked . MY review is to buttress the experience of other reviewers , that this product is badly flawed and should be avoided .	-1
If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you ... give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look . I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead . A sound decision and a happy customer right here ! I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them . : ) They just did n't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO , PHOTO , GAME , MUSIC , all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod ... and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET ... oh yeah , even audio books , anything ! It 's a plug n play device , recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer . No need to install the iTunes .	-1
The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far . I 'm still figuring out why . There is n't much features on the iPod at all , except games . My friend has this unit while not experience it much , I look at other reviews on this site and tried out the unit at Best Buy , and it 's definitely the most overrated gadget in history.SOUND QUALITY : The iPod 's sound quality is pretty good . The Creative player sounds a bit better , but not anything to worry about . It has an equalizer , but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod . The bass is deep and the treble is clear.DURABILITY : Not good . First problem , if you have n't seen the news recently , the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months . This is really stupid to me . 18 months for a battery is n't good , actually , it 's medicore . iRiver 's battery lasts four to five years . Also , the battery 's ARE N'T USER REPLACEABLE . However , the Creative and iRiver players are ( Rio 's is n't ) , and they only cost around $ 30 to replace , while iPod charges shipping and technical support . The iPod 's battery , 1.5 years . Yeah , pretty weak . Another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky , and scratches very easily . While all MP3 players are easy to scratch , the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver . Also , not liking the gel case . iRiver 's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.FEATURES : Really , there are n't any features , unless you call the games a feature . There is no FM tuner , while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen ( on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner ) , the iRiver H10-20GB , the Rio Karma , and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners . There is also no voice recording , something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod does n't . There is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 GB photo iPod , but it costs $ 20 more . There is an alarm and timer , but most MP3 players have this feature.EASE OF USE/DESIGN : The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player , and if you ca n't figure this out , you should n't even own one . The Click Wheel is a great design , something no one else came up with ( however , the iRiver has a touchpad ) . I 'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software . I just do n't like it , the weird thing is , I do n't know why I dislike it . Maybe because it does n't have a lot of skins to choose from like WMP , but then again , I dislike WMP as well because it 's slow on my computer . Anyhow , adding music to the player is easy.BATTERY LIFE : Pretty medicore at 12 hours , the Creative , iAudio , Rio , and iRiver players last longer.CUSTOMER SERVICE : Awful . Listen to this one , remember the battery statement I made earlier . If your battery dies and it 's still under warranty , guess what , you 're out of luck , because Apple does n't cover the battery in the iPod warranty . They have the nerve to charge you $ 30 for a warrantied iPod . There technical service is n't helpful either ; they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it . At least Creative and iRiver 's only charge toll fees like most companies.OVERALL : I highly dislike the iPod , even though the sound quality and design is above-average . Maybe in their 5th generation they 'll add features to the iPod . But for now , pleases do n't buy this , and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead .	-1
I second the first reviewer 's opinion . This is a total piece of sh*t. First I had trouble getting it to work on my WinXP desktop . After a couple reboots it finally worked , and the image quality was a total joke , even in the webcam capacity . The video quality was visibly worse than my 5-year-old Logitech webcam which had cost me about the same amount at CompUSA five years ago . In the end I returned this POS and will keep using my Logitech until it dies .	-1
Mine was broken when I got it -- - after playing a CD for about 15 minutes the sound would start getting really noisy and full of static . For the first 15 minutes , however , the sound was nice . If you get one that works it is nice . Also , note that for MP3 playback , there is no ID3 tag support -- - basically it is really primitive and only shows a number ( for which track is playing ) .	-1
We bought this RCA RCD160 Portable MP3/CD player boom box with AM/FM tuner for strictly limited use , just to play a couple of hours per week , as we practiced our dancing . We certainly never took this item to the nearby beach , there was no sand in this baby . We used it , in fact , only in AC mode , never with batteries ; only the CD player , and that only sparingly , and extremely gently . We could hear the songs we played well enough , and found the sound quality acceptable for our limited needs . However , the product suddenly , without warning died on us , and that in less than a year . What a bummer !	-1
Not one of the five cords worked in any of my devices ! I had to wiggle them to get them to get them to work . Stick with the Amazon basics cords I have NEVER had any problems with those ! ! !	-1
So just to be clear I am not being paid to write this review , this is me personal review from me , myself , and I : ) first things first.So to start things off I am forced to use the headset from the online cyber school ( this is not there fault that they give us the suckiest headphones on planet earth ) after the first year of school , I went through six of the AC-201 headsets ! ! ! ! and all the headsets broke in different ways . summer went by : ( and guess what , my school gave me the same headset again . so for the next 180 days of school I went through another 5 headsets ... thats about one head set every month ! in conclusion , pros : umm ill leave this blank : ) cons : E V E R Y T H I N G	-1
Yes I know , that 's not a real word , but I wore these for about a minute before I could n't stand them anymore .	-1
I purchased the BTA along with the Boss 8 gauge installation kit and followed all the installation instructions . The packaging of the BTA left a lot to be desired , in fact the Bazooka box was placed into another box with not insulating materials . None the less I anxiously started the installation in my vehicle.I ensured that the ground connection was conductive using my VOM and completed the wiring in my Toyota Land Cruizer . When all the wiring was completed I connected the power and wiring harness to the BTA and switched on the ignition and head unit . The power LED on the Bazooka did not come on , so I began to recheck the power wiring and the low level input form my head unit . Every thing was in order so contacted Amazon for a return authorization code and promptly returned the item . Amazon immediately shipped replacement to me.When the replacement arrived I heard a rattling song in the box while trying to open it , when I took the Bazooka out of the box some small pieces of the plastic housing fell out . On examination the plastic was all broken and the harness connection points were recessed . I promptly returned the item to Amazon and requested my money back to which they obliged once the returned item was received at their location.From the outset the Bazooka should have been better packaged for shipment via the couriers in the event that the package is mishandled . The suppliers can do a far better job in this respect . Very disappointed with the product packaging , order at your own risk and money .	-1
I bought it after seeing so many good reviews about it . I had previously used a Belkin one and I thought this could be better . But , I just do n't understand why people are so eager to give good commemts simply because it works . Of course , it works . But it has annoying features as well.The most serious flaw in my opion is the tiny volume . I normally turn my car speakers ' volume to 2/10 when I listen to CD or radio , which is loud enough for whatever speed I am driving . With PodFM or the Belkin one , I have to turn the volume to 8/10 and my mp3 player 's volume to 32/35 , which is ear deafening with any earbuds even on an airplane.The signal strength is n't strong . It does NOT overpower your local radio stations , it only overpowers the remote and really weak ones . So , when the radio station overpowers it , you will first get some very loud noise , and then it feels like someone is shouting directly into your ears.The sound quality is OK . But definately not as good as the FM radio stations . I just picked up a $ 9.00 cassette adapot from Walmart and immediately I heard the details in my mp3s again . I was blaming the speakers in my car . Now I know what to blame . The volumes went back to normal again . Now I can easily switch among FM , CD and my mp3 WITHOUT changing the volume.So , if your car has cassette player , buy a cassette adaptor . A cheap one will do the job well . Some old cars do n't automatically change play directions . You may need to reverse the current direction if you do n't hear good music . If there is only a CD player in your car , I would highly recommand to replace it with a mp3/CD player with an aux input jack . They are getting cheaper and cheaper , and a professional install should cost about $ 40.00.Overall , FM transmitter is a solution , but it has so many annoyances . I feel I just spent $ 40.00 to learn this lesson and got myself angry with it . I do n't even want to sell it on ebay , because the poor guy will hate me when he find out the truth.Should you have ever complained about anything in the whole last month , you should n't buy it . You have to be really tolerate to use it . And if that 's the case , I congratulate on your personality . But still , you will be much happier with a mp3/CD/AUX deck .	-1
I purchased this monopod mainly to do sports photography . They call it `` heavy duty '' but it really is n't . The snaps are wobbly and when fully extended ( with a large lens ) , seems like the hinges will break at any moment or the metal legs will bend . Also , I do n't think mine came with a bag .	-1
I bought this headset from the importer , UmeVoice.For $ 150 I got poor audio performance , poor service and painful return process.Surprisingly TheBoom came without a 3.5mm plug , that cost more ( more than the $ 150 price ) When I got it assembled it seemed to sound OK but when placing calls with a Nokia Lumia 900 my voice was very quiet ... . so quiet that folks could not understand me . I called UmeVoice ( not using their headset ) they suggested the obvious , talking louder , talking closer , getting a different phone ... They resisted returning it but finally wrote me an email saying that the owner reluctantly agreed.I went back to the $ 6 headset that I bought from Amazon . It works well .	-1
I have had a Disc Stakka for several years and it worked great but then all of a sudden it would not eject the disc anymore.So I bought a new one . It arrived in visable good condition but simply did not work . Had to return it .	-1
The DiskStakka is easy to install , and the OpdiTracker application is fairly easy to use , but the units themselves are are not very robust . I have two lightly used units at home ( used for a bit more than a year ) that are now non-functional . Two more we had at work have also quit working . With a 100 % failure rate , I wo n't be buying any more .	-1
The touch sensitive wheel is a joke ... not having the tactile feedback is a big disappointment for me . I like the size , but too flat/slim to provide ergonomics . I have to pinch the mouse in order to move it around and as a result , my fingers and wrist were hurting ! ! I ended up taking it back to OfficeDepot and got a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse for less than $ 30 . It only uses 1 AA unlike logitech 's 2 AAA ( costly ) and very much more comfortable . I forgot to mention ... When i bought the logitech mouse , it was missing the receiver that it was supposed to come with ! ! Unbelievable ... Went back and got another one that did have it . This is all I have to say , , , I would n't buy it if I were you : )	-1
I bought these because the price was great but I was disappointed . There is definitely too much bass and not much else . The sound is all highs and lows . Adjusting the graphic equalizer on the player ( software ) ca n't completely fix it . I bought the Creative T3000s to compare and they are noticeably better . I returned the Logitechs .	-1
These did not sound good . I know that other reviewers liked them which is why I purchased them , but these just would not do and I sent them back . I suppose maybe these would work for video games , but not listening to music or watching movies . There was good bass and highs above 3k , but there was n't much in between . These sounded very tinny and cold.After sending these back , I spent twice the money and went with the Companion 3 system which sounds much , MUCH better ! UPDATE ** I would highly recommend the Bose Companion 3 Series II computer speakers . They sound AWESOME ! Plus they have a front plug in for headphones or an alternate audio source . **	-1
As my previous Logitech Z5300e , this Z2300e has the same problem.The bass is too loud and it bothers too much.I controlled the sound card , the equalizer and even that it was too loud.No clear voices.I returned the Z5300e speakers.And this Z2300e speaker I will change for Bose companion 2 . I tested it and I can appreciate the difference.If you like a deafening bass you can buy this Z2300e Speakers .	-1
After reading the reviews I was very excited when these speakers arrived . But , immediately I was disappointed in their sound quality . The bass does not have the deep rumbling sound as it should and is more like a hollow version of the satellite speakers . The satellite speakers are soo tenny they hurt my ears at higher volumes and they have no depth at all . There is a significant amount of crackle and distortion in the satellite speakers.Pros : Attractive designTHX CertifiedExcellent surround sound abilityVolume control moduleVery easy installation and no software neededRCA adapter if you want to install into a home theater system instead of a computerCons : ExpensiveSatellites have a high tenny sound that can be painful at high volume and very little depth . Something I was very disappointed about after reading the reviews by other buyers.Subwoofer quality low - not much bass but it 's due to the channel it 's plugged into.Distortion can be heard in both the subwoofer and satellites.Cables coming from the satellites are a bit short , but not a huge problem.They 're great looking speakers and since they 're suppose to be THX certified I thought they would be worth the extra money ... but I 'm telling you , for this price they are crap .	-1
Sorry , 40 watts per channel at 10 % THD just does n't cut it for a quality audio product . Too bad they do n't tell you about the 10 % THD part until you BUY THEM and read the specifications . I listened to these for about an hour , playing a variety of music CD 's and just could n't take it anymore . I should have known better to expect quality sound from speakers at this price . Sorry Logitech , if this is the best you can do , it 's not good enough . Kudos to Amazon ! They took them back and refunded my money quickly . I 'll gladly buy more stuff in the future , just not these speakers .	-1
This thing could be not just a iPod beater , but THE iPod beater . Instead I 'd rather have a $ 100 flash based player like the Rave-MP258 ( actually had one ) . Why ? Because the SonicStage softwear is the most crippling act of sabotague I 've ever seen a manufacturer ruin their product with . It 's like if Porsche decided to ship the 911 with granite tires . Hell of a product , but does not work worth a $ # ! +.SonicStage has something called openMG . It checks for some kind of digital copyright but would n't even let me transfer ripped wma files on my pc which came from my own cd 's ? How goofy is that . Forget drag and drop ... I like the convenience of that , but even though `` My Computer '' showed transfer of mp3s to the the Sony ( drive H on my pc ) when I tried to play them they were n't there.Sony continues to disappoint . Years ago it was Beta . They did not share the format to others at first and then JVC came along with VHS and licensed it to all who wanted to use it . Bye , bye Betamax.SACD will likely fail . Try to find one in a disc store ... You ca n't . Plus while others like Marantz build universal DVD-A /SACD players , Sony in it 's inane superiority builds only SACD players . No DVD-A support . If multi-channel audio has a chance the only way is through universal players , but Sony will help send the whole concept to the grave with it 's tunnel vision.Do n't buy any Sony digital music player unless you want total frustration like I 've got . I should have purchased an iPod by the new leader in personal audio , Apple ... A # @ ** computer company can build finer audio equipment than the world 's largest consumer electronics company ... Whad'ya think about that . Sony , no baloney ... but a load of something for sure !	-1
The sound quality is mediocre , and without the EQ/noise canceling switched on the natural sound of the drivers is pathetic . I mainly use them just for the noise canceling , which probably gets you 10 or 15 dB of attenuation . I have no idea where they get their claim of `` 80 % noise reduction '' . They also broke pretty quickly . The drivers separated from the headband . There are so many junky headphones out there and this is just another pair . I am an audio professional .	-1
I 've purchased this tripod because it 's got a much quicker locking mechanism over my old Bogen 3021B-Pro tripod ( Which is a true workhorse for me for over 7 years , never let me down ) .Features same adjustable height design and a unique horizontal shooting pole as the 3021B-pro , the weight is same as the 3021b-pro.The new Neotec locking mechanism is really great invention , super fast to work with , all you need to do to extend the tripod is just pull it out , and it locks in any position , no knobs to push or turn . It also comes with a free comfortable carrying strap , that is nice.However , the tripod feels like it 's build very cheaply , A design flaw ( IMHO ) is that the tripod build with it 's thinest tube section towards the top and thickest tube at the bottom , this creates a horrible wobble ( Bogen claims that this design keeps sand away , heck , I 've never had a sand problem with my old 3021bpro , why bother ? ) . I tried to do some 5 sec exposure in a room with no wind and any other disruption that would effect the exposure , and the picture comes out blurry ( yes , motion blur ) . The tripod creates wobble itself because of this design.Another major flaw ? The tripod will scratch so easily that it already got plenty of scratch within a week of purchase ! My 3021bpro have n't had a single scratch from heavy-duty usage till 4 or 5 years later and numerous airport rough handling . This is just not acceptable.Take a look at the re-designed 3021b-pro , now called 055XProB , it is the standard that will last you for years to come .	-1
Ive not yet upgraded my access point to 802.11g , but I bought this device because it will be ready when I do . Unfortunately , it does n't have nearly the range of my 802.11b devices on my existing network . My cable modem and access point are one room over from my computer , with a single plaster wall in between . My 802.11b network cards connect to the network with about 60 % signal strength and 11 Mbps speed . This device does n't even see the network at the same range . Totally sux .	-1
Not what I thought it would be at all . It is low power and high heat . Make sure it is what you need .	-1
Ok had this for a couple weeks now when I noticed that the screen was hanging at a angle . I took the screen off the wall and took one of the end caps off , the side that dosnt have the wind mech on it . I was surprised to find that the female part that holds the spindle was broken before then glued . Very cheap . I am not going to go through the bull of sending this thing back so I re-glued with some strong epoxy . Dont buy from this company . I find a company who fixes something then sells at a brand new price cant be trusted . If I could give no stars I would . I wont recommend them that is a fact .	-1
Over the past month I have tried 3 different Elite Screens manual projection screens ( 135 & # 34 ; , 120 & # 34 ; , 106 & # 34 ; ) .Good:1 . Retract mechanism worked well.2 . Hooks for suspended ceiling mount are integrated in the 120 & # 34 ; and 106 & # 34 ; .Problems:1 . Insufficient packaging : All had at least one dent in the metal casing , the 106 & # 34 ; had 4 ! . Check the back side of the screen opening , they were ALL bent to some extend.2 . When hung ( suspended ) from the ceiling , both the 135 and 120 had a 1/2 & # 34 ; + twist in the metal casing from end to end . Clearly the metal casing is too thin.3 . Screen : Despite following the manufacturers recommendation ( leaving down/open for one week ) waves were still visible . I 'm currently on the 120 & # 34 ; which is the worst so far , 106 & # 34 ; was the best . 135 & # 34 ; had a discoloration spot , 106 & # 34 ; had a dot on the back ( think dried paint drizzle ) which resulted in a visible indentation on the screen.Summary:1 . Manufacturer quality control is terrible.2 . Amazon 's excellent return policy is the only reason I continue to order replacements . I 'm hoping that I will get a good one eventually .	-1
I have owned this mouse for about 6 months now and I have not had a problem until now . The left click is now not working . It clicks two times if I press it one time and that can really cause some problems . I have closed programs and documents by mistake without saving etc . The right click does n't really work that great either . It is really hard to click it down . That started about 2 months ago . So all in all the click on this is no good !	-1
This mouse is great , has excellent dynamics and all . However , the downside of it , that after I bought it , I found out that it does n't have a little portable signal receiver . Instead , the signal receiver is the same as the charging base . Which makes taking the mouse and the laptop around very hard . Its a great mouse , yet its not that much of a milestone from previous Logitech mouses .	-1
Overall the mouse works as well as the optical Logitech I was using . However I found a huge flaw in the way the MX 1000 works . The mouse does not work at all when you need to start from a cd ( such as Disk Warrior ) or when you use the option key at startup ( on a Mac ) to choose what disk to start from . In order to do anything in these cases you need to connect a different mouse . This is entirely unacceptable to me and I am returning the MX 1000 . I contacted Logitech support and they tell me that is not a feature of the mouse . They also sounded rather unsure of what they sell . To have software that will not support the mouse use at these times is completely unacceptable .	-1
Very disapointed that it is not clearly stated by Amazon that this product is to be used only by Vonage ( very expensive compared to other providers like Inphonex which is now my provider ) . I bought two routers RT31P2 and two PAP2 phone adapters all with Phone ports hoping I would be able to connect all my family ( spread around the world ) . I got a Huge surprise when I noticed that they are locked only for use with Vonage . It says there is a Mail in Rebate worth 50 bucks , anyway it will only last less than two months . Other providers do n't even charge monthly fees.I had already sent all the units to various countries and after finding out that they are to be used EXCLUSIVELY with Vonage I just had to let them die where they were sent . It is not worth the shipping to bring them back.As disappointing as this , was that I supposed this was going to happen so I contacted customer support from Amazon and asked them ( before buying ) if they were a `` with Vonage telephony system '' or if they were a `` exclusively for Vonage telephony system '' . They did n't know so I just assumed they would n't be so distracted to not mention this . Specially for starters like us it may have been the most important thing to advertise : EXCLUSIVELY FOR VONAGEI have always been a fan of Linksys products , my house is full of their products and never had trouble with the hardware . For sure I will continue to buy Linksys products , for sure I will never use vonage ( eventhough I am sure it provides excellent clear voice communication ; do n't get cofussed , there are others that will give you more for a lot less go to yahoo and spend 30 seconds making a quick search and you will see ) , and for sure I had to tell other people what they are doing so nobody else will loose the money I lost , and what is most valuable , my time.Make sure that when you buy a PAP2 it says : Model PAP2-NAConclussion : I just lost 260 bucks plus shipping and handling ( internationally )	-1
I purchased this to combine a router and phone adapter ( to get rid of the Motorola PA that I got when I signed up for Vonage in July 2004 ) . I wrestled with getting it set up correctly and went through the usual HEL* with Vonage support ( their support is horrible , horrible , and more horrible ) . After 3 weeks I got the case escalated to their tier 3 team ( the only ones who know anything at all ) and with careful troubleshooting he saw that the MTU size is what was causing me to not be able to connect outgoing calls . ( I could receive calls , not not place calls - dial tone was ok ) . After wrestling with my ISP thinking it was their fault , we re-registered my old phone adapter with Vonage , removed this router and all was working again .	-1
Camera came within a few days . Seemed rugged enough at first . Then the little fake cable popped out of the fake base.And the fake winky-blinky LED light does n't work.And the fake door for the fake batteries is a pain in the neck . Having to hold onto two tiny screws while perched on a ladder 25 ' in the air while changing batteries is not fun ... but that 's ok because the fake LED does n't work anyway so I 'll never have to change batteries.And the fake camera moves too easily in the fake mounting bracket.Too bad they do n't take fake money for it.Oh well , perhaps criminals will be stupid enough to fall for it .	-1
Ordered mine on 19 March , never in stock and now I receive a notice that it might ship between 22 Jun to sometime in July . The online page says they 're in stock ... do n't believe it . I just cancelled and will look elsewhere . Amazon should drop these bums .	-1
On storage boxes in the garage , pretty much all labels have started to curl up after 3-4 months . I ca n't blame the heat ( We 're not in the thick of summer yet ) and certainly can not blame humidity , because I definitely do not live in a humid climate . Before you order , keep that in mind . Your intended use may not be best with this type of label .	-1
I expected better service . I thought I was paying for quality when I bought the charger and 4 `` True 9.6V '' Powerex batteries . I bought the batteries and charger along with a Shure dual wireless microphone system . They worked OK for a couple months but a year has passed and I need a whole new set of batteries . One by one they stopped accepting a charge , red light just flashes when I insert the batteries in the charger . Red light will flash for days and batteries will not recharge . I thought they were good for `` Up to 1,000 charges '' but these did n't make it to 50 charges .	-1
I chose this cable because it did n't have any negative reviews about not fitting securely into your device . Now I 'm sorry I bought one . I tried plugging it into my new LCD TV and it just fell out each time . It would not stay securely plugged in . I 've read other reviews of other brands of TOSlink cables where people have had the same problem , and I 'm wondering if maybe my TV is to blame.EDIT : A few weeks later I went to Radio Shack and bought a 6 foot gold series digital optical audio cable for $ 17.99 . This one works perfectly . When I pushed it into my TV 's port , I felt it snap into place securely . The other end plugged into my home theater also snapped securely into place . The Tripp Lite cable came in a zip loc bag , and I wonder if it was used and worn down , or if they 're all defective . My new cable came in secure plastic packaging that obviously had not been opened or used.In the end it was all worth it , since the Dolby digital sound I get with the digital cable is excellent.I do n't recommend the Tripp Lite cable . I recommend looking for a better one that has good reviews .	-1
False advertising , package claims Vista compatible but they have no drivers for x64 and if you read the replies people have gotten from reps at Microsoft they do n't plan any . Good job supporting your own hardware and OS MS .	-1
This used to be a great tool.Until Windows 7 came out.I plugged in my Fingerprint Reader , just as I had for previous versions of Windows and was faced with a message from Win 7 that it could n't find a driver . Strange , I thought , since it was a Microsoft product.I went on to Microsoft 's website only to find out that they had rendered their Fingerprint Reader obsolete and would no longer support it or provide any drivers for Windows 7.Very disappointing .	-1
I have now opened my wallet three different times and bought and used three different iPod FM transmitters:1 . I bought the origininal Griffin ipood RoadTrip as a gift for my daughter - sucked ( I would classify under `` does not work ! '' ) 2 . Bought the original Monster ipod FM transmitter ( non-charging , like the Monster AI-IP-FM-CH iCarPlay - now $ 47.99 at Amazon ) 3 . Bought the Monster A-IP-FM-CH-PS iCarPlay `` Plus '' ( currently $ 68.26 at Amazon ) for a recent family road trip.Please help me and yourself - DO NOT PURCHASE THE GRIFFIN PRODUCT - they burned me for this device that sounded worse than an old AM transister radio . They should not get more of the public 's hard-earned money.INSTEAD , I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE MONSTER A-IP-FM-CH-PS iCarPlay `` Plus '' ( $ 69 ) . It has very good FM sound ( false short of a direct digital connection ) , button presets ( invaluable as you travel throught your `` home '' FM radio area , and it tunes over the entire FM channel range . You will need the latter as FM stations will bleed into YOUR music if you are not able to tune onto an `` empty '' FM channel.I did not have to spend the time to write this , but I hope that it sets straight some bad karma released on the world by the folks at Griffin . I also hope that this helps you to make a good purchase .	-1
I was very disappointed with the nexImage . The barrel was crossed threaded and I could not remove it to insert the Celestron Neximager reducer lens . I called Celestron and they cofirmed that that is a problem with this device . They were to get back to me in a couple of days to resolve the issue . A week went by and no one called . Overall the product shows signs of poor workmanship . I returned the product back to Ace Camera . I am waiting on a refund . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this from amazon in 2008 ( back then the price was only about $ 27 ) and have used it very little but have been remiss in not reporting its failures . I have a wifi network in my home and most of the time it could not find a wifi signal even though 2 my computers and my 2 PS3s plus several friends lap tops have no problem picking up the wifi signal . I went to 2 different Apple Stores that have wifi and an internet cafe with wifi and most of the time it indicated no wifi signal sometimes it indicated a very weak wifi signal even though these locations have a very strong signal and a very strong signal was indicated on my macbook pro . If I could give this piece of junk a 0 star rating I would have .	-1
This card works , I guess but you can not browse the internet with your palm through it . Still have not figured out what use it is , I thought I would be able to check my email and such if I had this card , not so . A bit frustrating to get into a room that has wireless access and not be able to browse the internet .	-1
I bought 2 . One could not be recognized on my mac till I reformatted it on a linux box . Both are so slow as to be unbearable . Both are being retunred .	-1
I CAN USE IT ONLY ONE TIME . NOW I LOST ALL DATA IN THIS VERY VERY BAD PRODUCT.THE WORST FLASH PEN I EVER HAVE . DONT BUY IT	-1
Search online for this thing 's issues , and you 'll see that it tends to get borked . Borked hard . I just had someone come into my computer lab where I 've been working for a few years . The drive she brought in , that was brand new , that was JUST working yesterday , is fried . Hard . Computers no longer recognise it . Tried it on three different PCs , an iBook , and a G5 . No dice . Go to the PNY website to see that there 's no way to contact them to tell them what kind of garbage they 're selling . Do NOT waste your money on this . Get a decent product .	-1
This is a great lens , but it let me down at the worst possible moment . After 40 years of using Canons , I can never totally trust this lens , or Canon cameras . I got an error message saying the camera was not communicating with the lens and I needed to clean the contacts on the lens which I did several times without success . Then I swapped out the battery , turned off auto focus and image stabilizer , pulled the chip and put it back in , etc . All I got was a black screen and the error message . Then I pulled the lens from my 60D and mounted it on my 30D and still the same . Here I am on a road trip for my book a thousand miles from home and after a year of planning . Is this just an anomaly ? No . My daughter had the same lens it and it failed her too . Like I said , if you 're in this position , you need a backup lens and a backup body . I do n't know what 's going on with Canon , but either workmanship or engineering is in decline . I bought a 60D in April and the flash refused to pop up within a couple of weeks of purchase which Canon fixed under warranty . And by the way they wo n't pay for shipping . It cost me $ 33 for shipping and insuring to send it 40 miles to the West Coast service center . Today I 'm driving down to Redding , CA to pick out a Tamron lens which is just what my daughter did . I 'll get a repair estimate from Canon which I expect will be at least $ 180 . If it 's too high , the lens goes in the dumpster . Good luck .	-1
So I had it for a few weeks and a leg broke out of the top part , but i can pop it back in and it still works . It 's annoying . The build quality really is n't that great . But for 20-something dollars , it 's acceptable . It works , and that 's the most important thing .	-1
I was so mad that this thing broke when I was trying to get it to extend . I t just seemed so cheap . ;	-1
I love Amazon.com but at times they sell stuff with bad product info.. This item works well if you have a small digital cam . The tripod wo n't stay put , it will flip over and fall back once the cam is on it . I have a Nikon D5000 and its not all that big/heavy but the info stated it will work with a cam like that , so I got it . Tried it for the first time on the beach and boy did it stink ( can use a diff word but wo n't ) .. It would not stay on the tripod and it kept falling over or backwards . The part that makes it move forward or backwards did n't work at all . The tripod did stand fine but the part that holds the cam was unable to tighten to keep cam from moving/falling over/backwards . I just got a brand new one as a gift and its worth over $ 120 but its well worth it . Having both side to side shows a huge diff between cheap and heavy duty . So I would not buy/give or recommend this tripod to anyone . Its built for a child with a $ 10 cam , not a cam that 's worth over $ 1000 with lens.. I got the Sunpak platinum plus 750 pro ( or close to that ) and boy what a diff.. Even comes with a monopod and built strong . I would recommend the heavy duty Sunpak to anyone that is going to use it over and over and has a heavy/big/expensive cam . It even comes with a life time warranty.. Wish Amazon would take back my cheap tripod and give me at least credit towards anything else . Hope this helps .	-1
You want to use the 580EX in a simple task by working as a hair or back light with your more powerful studio strobes ? Then you will be in for a rude surprise when you connect an inexpensive photo-optical slave-triggering mechanism to the 580 's hot shoe foot . With the 580 set on manual , it will flash once and then lockup . Yes , the dreaded internal SCR lockup will require you to power off and on to reset the flash to fire another shot before it freezes again . Repeat off/on and shake your head at this expensive and poorly designed dare-I-say toy.Is Canon trying to screw us by not telling about this issue in their instruction manual ? Who knows . To our rescue is Michael Bass Designs ' blog which walks us step-by-step on obtaining a compatible Sonia photo-optical slave trigger with the proper cord and modified hot shoe to be able to perform a very simple task of using a slave triggered strobe.Because Canon `` forgot '' to include a PC socket , Mr. Bass will even explain what to do in order to connect an RF transceiver like the Pocket Wizard to the 580 to enable wireless flash photography . Depending on where you live , it can be a costly retrofit of an auxilary jack by Mr. Bass . Or , even better , buy a Wein hot shoe to household synch adapter and adjust the hot shoe tabs for a custom fit.The 580 is great as an on-camera walk about flash/camera combo . It even works well in the master/slave setup or with the expensive and 10 year old Canon Speedlite Transmitter ST-E2 . I also hate the plastic hot shoe foot which is almost impossible to slide into the tightest hot shoe umbrella adaptors . But , if you do n't want the hassles of spending more money on third party parts to use the 580 as a slave with studio strobes , then buy ( for example ) a cheap Vivitar 285 and put a cheap photo-optical slave trigger on it for carefree studio work with the big boy lights .	-1
While researching MURS radios a few years ago , I bought a variety of models , including a pair of these since they had just come onto the market relatively recently.What really irked me the most was that the radio comes with 6 AA NiMH batteries , but they 're bottom-of-the-barrel quality batteries ( 1600mAh ? ) . They do n't hold a charge . They get super hot in most rapid chargers . And with the built-in charger , they take forever to charge . ( 12 hours ? ) The antenna is detachable , but I 'm not sure what kind of replacement you can use with it . The volume control was decent , but everything else about the radio felt kinda shoddy . Even the transmit range of this radio vs. the other MURS radios I have is much worse.The radio has n't fallen apart on me and it 's generally usable , so I ca n't give it only 1 star . So 2 stars it is .	-1
The WUSB54GS description on Amazon does NOT indicate which OS the wireless bridge works with . Only AFTER I received it , did I notice the carton indicates that it would NOT work with Vista Home Premium 64-bit . I confirmed this with a Linksys technician . He suggested , and I bought , the Linksys WUSB600N which costs more , but works fine .	-1
Lexar cards do n't work in Panasonic SD Audio devices . I could n't understand why it would n't work since SD is supposed to be pretty standard . I called Panasonic and they said that Lexar and Kodak cards are so low in quality and slow to write that they wo n't work with the the SD Audio format.No problems using other brands like Sandisk , Panasonic , Kingmax , etc .	-1
1 ) It wo n't work without the power adaptor . I 've tried it on my Mac 's OE usb ports and on a pci board . Both will drive any usb product I 've ever plugged into them including power hungry products like speakers , except the Kensington Pocket Hub . The console log indicates it wants too much power . I 've seen the same report on Apple 's web site about this product.2 ) The cord is a bit over 3 feet long . Unless your usb ports ( and ac ) are nearby , do n't expect to locate the hub anywhere convenient . Long mini usb cords are hard to find and expensive .	-1
I bought this after a recent trip to Athens as I found I could n't get the entire scene in some pics without compromising them with other stuffs.Bottom line : although it does the job the build quality is cheap compared to the 15-85mm and the cost is outrageous . It feels and looks cheap . The images are okay but my camera locks up often and doesnt allow me to shoot ... this has n't happened ever with my 7 other lenses . I am really disappointed in the quality .	-1
I bought this lens to be used with my 20D . The focal length range is quite impressive and can be very useful for DSLRs with an APS-C size sensor.However , the first thing I noticed is that there is extremely high vignetting/light fall off at 17mm . There is a dark circle surrounding the frame and is very visible when the edges of the frame have high luminosity . If you snap on a UV filter or a polarizer , you can forget about taking pictures at 17-20mm . That 's a huge loss.Secondly , the picture is very soft up to f/8 or so . My control over exposure time and the depth of field is minimal at this aperture . Image Stabilizer works only at around 1/40 seconds or less . During longer exposure times , pictures still show camera shake.Third , Canon , on it 's website does n't give MTF charts for this lens . It 's available for all other lenses including their cheap consumer zooms . May be they figured this was n't worth $ 600 and did n't want to publicize it.Bottomline : If you are point-and-shoot photographer that has a DSLR for kicks , then go ahead and get this lens . It 's one all-purpose lens for a 350D or a 20D . But if you are serious about photography , avoid it . I later bought a Tamron 28-75mm f/2.8 XR Di and a Tamron 17-35mm f2.8-4 XR Di . Together it costed $ 800 . For the quality of their optics and the f2.8 constant max aperture , I happily gave up IS and USM . To top it , Tamron gave an $ 80 mail-in rebate and a standard 6 year warranty.I returned the lens to Amazon for a full refund , and I have n't had a more pleasant experience than their return process . In the last 5 years that I 've done business with Amazon , this was my first return . They give you a UPS packing slip which you print out and stick to the package before handing it over to the UPS driver . Within a week , the refund was processed .	-1
If you are just starting out as a photographer and this is your first DSLR , this wide angle to medium telephoto zoom lens will do just fine . A focal length of 18 millimeters on the wide end of this zoom is the same as 28.8 mm on a full frame camera . The edge sharpness suffers when used with a wide open aperture but improves as you stop down a few f-stops . Also , this lens lacks a focus ring that has a distance scale which might make focusing tricky ( for instance if you are trying to capture the aurora borealis ) . The lens also has a cheap plastic feel about it which is quite expectable since it is designed as a low cost lens . To this lens 's credit it is very light which makes it ideal for light backpacking.However , if you plan on becoming serious about your work , you might want to start considering the alternatives . One option is to pass this lens by completely and go with the Canon EF-S 17-85 IS USM lens . Not only is the EF 17-85 ( ~ $ 500 ) equivalent to ~27 mm on the wide end , it has IS capability and is a much sharper lens ( it should probably come with a box of bandaids ! ) . If you plan on becoming very serious about your work , I would also strongly urge you to consider the Canon 17-40 f/4 L lens which is one of Canon 's professional lenses . While it is much more expensive ( ~ $ 600 ) and heavier , the results are very sharp and it is weather sealed . If you are after and ultra-wide angle lens , the EF-S 10-22 is the way to go although it is only useable on APS-C sized DSLR sensors which to be honest is only going to be a problem if you plan on upgrading to a full frame camera such as the Canon 5D in the near future . The EF-S 10-22 is equivalent to 16-35 mm on a full frame camera and is another very sharp lens.It is important to remember that you just dropped $ 800+ on a camera body and trying to get off cheap by buying a cheap lens will lead to disappointment .	-1
While this is n't the worst handheld I 've ever had , it certainly is n't up to the quality or functionality that I expect from Palm . The positives first : It has a good-sized screen that can be viewed in either a vertical ( portrait ) or horizontal ( portrait ) position and the display is crisp and bright , with true color rendition . It has three separate writing areas for capital letters , lower case letters and numbers , so the tiresome strokes to denote case are no longer necessary . And , unlike the Tungsten C , which I had previous to the T5 , this model plays mp3 files . It 's easy to set up and lightweight , however the latter might just as easily be considered a negative because the reason it 's lighter than my old Tungsten C is because the T5 is plastic rather than the metal of the C , the T3 and other Palm models.As for the cons , most of them seem to be related to what I can only interpret as a greedy attempt by Palm to gouge consumers for extra profits . Unlike every other Palm I 've had , the T5 does NOT come with a cradle . Rather it has an awkward synch cable/charger that is cumbersome because it has two cords , which tangle easily . Even more irritating , the T5 lacks the universal connector that nearly every other Palm uses , so all of the additional chargers and synch cables that I already own and used with my previous Palms ca n't be used with the T5 . Thus , I had to buy the `` cradle kit '' for the T5 , which is basically a cheap , plastic cradle and another of the cumbersome charger/synch cords -- all for a substantial price . But it was a necessary purchase unless I want to shuttle the synch cable between my home and office every day . Shame on Palm ! In addition , the T5 has some sort of software glitch that occurs when changing screen orientation , so if you are unfortunate enough to get one of the units that was not patched before it left the factory , you will have to go to the Palm website and download the software update that repairs this problem.You may also be tempted to purchase the silver-colored hard case for the Tungsten series , since Palm is now offering a rebate for the entire price of the case ( around $ 40 . ) My advice is to avoid this model case , however , even though it is essentially free . The hard case lacks any pockets or other places to store business cards or other accessories , plus -- and here 's the real problem -- once you secure the T5 unit inside the case , there is no easy access to the stylus or to the headphone jack . You must flip the case open and pop the unit outside of the case 's interior in order to plug in your headset ! For me , this makes the case useless , as I routinely listen to music while the unit is inside my pocket . So I am back to using my old leather case that I 've had since my first Palm 105 purchase . It does n't actually fit the new , slimmer T5 very well , but since the special Tungsten case also does n't fit well , I figure it does n't much matter.The reason I even bought the T5 is because the screen burned out on my Tungsten C after 18 months of use . Now , I do n't know how long a unit 's screen can be expected to function , but it seems to me that for the price of the C ( $ 500 . ) the screen should not burn out after just one year and a half of use . There 's actually a big , black burn mark that extends across the screen ! I thought I 'd have the unit repaired , but then I had some interaction with the dreadful Palm customer service system -- all email over the web ; no real people on the phone -- and realized that by the time I got the T C repaired , assuming it could be -- I will be old and gray and ready for retirement.The sad thing is that I have also had Microsoft-based handhelds and really disliked them , so there is n't a good alternative to Palm products . And Palm used to be such a great company , giving true value for a reasonable price . What happened to this first-rate , customer-oriented company ? ! ?	-1
Here we go again . Palm 's latest effort seems like no effort at all . They have stopped including a cradle after many years of including one . No wi-fi seems greedy now that they offer a card for more money . The look is not Tungsten T series but rather Tungsten E series . Full time high resolution plus ( 320x480 ) may be good news for some . I am able to use many of my 3rd party apps with my T3 provided that I do n't open it up to full screen . Still , my T3 is horribly crash prone to the point of being unacceptable . With no option on the T5 but constant full screen I can just imagine what a nightmare it would be trying to use 3rd party apps ( mostly games ) . After buying the whole tungsten series so far , I 'm afraid the buck stops here.I guess that now that there is no competition from Handspring or Sony , Palm can just put out whatever they want with a take it or leave it attitude . Well , I 'm going to pass even though I 'm very disappointed . The PDA market is shrinking now that most people have one . And with junk like the T5 Palm is contributing to this shrinking market . They have no one to blame but themselves .	-1
Amazon or `` Battery Center '' would not let me ship to my P.O . Box . So , for some reason i had to get them to ship two little batteries to my physical address ( UPS/FEDEX ) . I got a confirmation not too long ago saying the batteries had began shipping . Guess how they shipped it ? USPS . Now , the batteries will not get to me . This has happened more than once on amazon . I probabaly will not order from this company again . I may let you all know how the batteries are when or if they ever get to me .	-1
Bought this to replace the original battery in my aging Canon Powershot G2 . Battery had to be constantly charged after just a few months use as it barely held a charge , dying just minutes after a few shutter clicks and , causing me to miss some good shots . Had to resort to the original battery which is finally on its way out after many years of faithful service .	-1
I bought these mainly for music and I found that they were too heavy on the vocals and drums . Guitars often ended up getting lost underneath . The treble range could be impressive at times , but it bordered on being too bright , and suffered from really bad sibilance , which I 'm sensitive to . The mid-bass was overly punchy . There is also zero low end bass . I thought this might be a problem while reading the reviews , but I 've met so many people who are bass nuts and need to have ridiculously loud bass that I do n't listen to anyone when it comes to bass anymore . I 'm not docking any stars for the lack of deep bass though , because it 's quite possible these were designed to be used with a sub . Just be aware that these are not full-range by any means.Overall , the unbalanced sound and sibilance is what did these in for me , and I ended up selling them .	-1
Speakers as a whole are getting worse . I feel this is because people are buying them for home Theater , and so long as they go `` boom '' people will give them 5 stars . I use speakers for audio . 2 channel audio . Since the 70 's there has been lots of great speakers that cover full range sounds with just 2 channels . Technology has not changed . There is zero need to have a sub rumbling the floor as this is completely undefined bass . Now you know where I 'm coming from.What I found with these Polks is merely OK speakers leaning towards bad . They are overly bright . The treble is not at all natural sounding . Symbals do n't sound like they do in person . The mids are thin . The bass range is n't bad but again suffers from lack of definition . Basically , these sound a little like computer speakers no matter what I played thru them . That means , they sound cheap . At only 30 pounds each they obviously are very cheap drivers . I have found that heavy drivers always sound more defined as they have more magnet . That theory holds true again as these polks would probably be pretty good with more magnet . That 's the biggest flaw I found with them was the lack of definition . Everything was small and less defined than it should be and leaning towards unnatural . Good piano recordings sounded a bit like a Casio keyboard . This is not good . There is no reason for this other than the drivers must be the cheapest of cheap . To bad . At time the bass drum and Bass seemed to compete and crapped out the drivers . This puzzled me as with 3 drivers you 'd think this not a problem.What I will give Polk points for is the looks . My pair was black with blue cones . This looked awesome . To bad they do n't sound awesome . Honestly , these are $ 100 per speaker value , no more or its a rip . Polk puts out lots of crap so I am not shocked . But electronica fans who play nothing but Casio sounds and Home Theater will rave about them despite having never but actual music thru them . I have heard much worse but I have also heard much better . Those who say you get what you pay for are only half right . Polk and Energy have both been putting out lots of cheap drivers in pretty boxes and at times for staggering prices.For me these are a fail . I have old Athena bookshelves that sound better . Athenas were not expensive , rather quite comparable and I believe even the same parent company .	-1
Adaptec USED to offer an AC adapter for this unit and the very similar AUA-1411 ( 2 USB2 , 1 6-pin FireWire ports ) . It was item 2069800 , the ACK-1411 kit . [ UPDATED : it 's definitely no longer available , they no longer make or sell it . ] The online User Guide for this item says it should have a `` 12V , *2.1A* '' ( my emphasis ) adapter . This comes out to 25.2 watts available . 2 USB2 connections only consume 2x ( 5V x 500mA ) = 5 watts , so no problem . However , the 1394 specs say that devices may call for 8-30V , 1.5A - a range of from 12-45 watts , far exceeding the Adaptec adapter 's output at the high end ! The Radio Shack adapter can only produce 12V x 1.1A = 13.2 watts , which just barely reaches the low end of the 1394 wattage range . Check the power requirements of any device you connect to the 6-pin 1394 port VERY carefully when using the RS adapter , or you 're risking an overheat , meltdown , or fire ! The really sad thing is , if they had included the adapter , this could easily have been a 4-star review - Adaptec products have always been reliable , efficient , and stable for me in the past . How this oversight got into this product , I really ca n't imagine - it does n't fit with my idea of Adaptec at all.ANOTHER UPDATE : there are now appropriate 12V adapters made by 3rd parties with the correct-sized 3.5mm/1.3mm jack ( or adapters ) available . Google for Powerstream - I power USB and FireWire items through mine with one of their adapters with good results .	-1
I played around with this device for 4 hours , called tech support - waited 30 minutes , was then put on hold for another 10 minutes before I gave up.I 've finally figured out how to get it to work in AP mode - Win XP.One of the things I figured out was that every time you moved the switch on the bottom of the dlink , you lose all your settings.1 . Set the dlink to AP mode on the bottom of the unit.2 . Connect the dlink to your laptop via ethernet cable.3 . On your laptop - Ctrl Panel - Double click Local connections.Scroll down to Internet Protocol ( TCP/IP ) 4 . Click on properties and change from `` Obtain an IP address automatically '' to `` Use the following IP address - type in192.168.0.99 and Subnet mask of 255.255.255.0then click OK-OK.5 . Open up your browser and type in 192.168.0.30type in `` admin '' for the name and since it does n't have a defualt password , just click ok.6 . Run the setup wizard and follow the prompts and then have the router save and restart.7 . Disconnect the ethernet cable from the laptop and connect it to your regular router.8 . On your laptop `` view your wireless connections '' and choose the one you just setup withe the dlink . Enter your security password.9 You should now be able to securely get to the internet . ***********************************************************Client Mode is very complicated , but with the help of other Amazon reviews I figured out . Here 's the process as best I can describe.CLIENT Mode - This is where you are connecting the 730AP Router wirelessly to the network and attaching it via Ethernet cable to your laptop . This is probably what I 'll use most of the time when I travel.You first need to know the name of the wireless network you are going to connect to , what sort of encryption it uses , ( if possible ) and the password to get into the wireless network . The router setup will ask you these questions.You then need to setup the router to use those settings . ( XP is what I use . ) Control Panel - Network Settings - Lan Settings - Scroll down to TCP-IP - PropertiesChange it to read -192.168.0.99255.255.255.DNS Servers24.217.0.524.217.0.5 ( Note the DNS servers I use are Open DNS . ) If you have n't already setup a password , use admin and no password.If you have already setup a new password , entire that at the prompt.When you go through the router setup , you need to know what type of encryption and the password for the wireless you are using.You will also have to `` Search '' for the wireless network - there may be more than one around and choose the correct one.When you haves setup the router , and it is rebooting , go back to Network Connections and change the Properties to : - Obtain and IP address automatically- Use the DNS Server addresses - 24.217.0.5That 's THE Open DNS servers I use.Turn off the computer and reboot.It finally works !	-1
I purchased this unit after trying the Wyflyer and it was easier to get running however the documentation is poor . The AC adapter failed after about 2 weeks of use and all contacts with D-Link support have been ignored . I can still use the unit via the USB power supply however it seems to get unreasonably hot which leads me to question how much power it is pulling from the USB adapter . I think it has fried one USB port already but can not conclusively prove it was this units fault . If I try to use the AC adapter built in the unit gets frying hot in seconds and never does finish the boot .	-1
Headphones uncerimoniously quit working after one day of use at my PC . Actually , to be specific , left channel works great , right channel is dead . Unfortunately , I through away the packaging . Fortunately , these were only $ 18 . Should have stuck with Sennheiser I guess .	-1
I had my Zire 72 for 1 week and the little post inside the power input broke off in the adapter plug.I hope others can learn from me . Do n't be nonchalant in plugging your unit in.DO IT CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY EACH TIME.I liked my old Palm pilot better . It was a Sony Clie SJ33 . Even though it was only a Palm OS4 , it was a workhorse that was well built and had it where it counted . I 'd consider just going back to that .	-1
I had several problems with the iPod , mostly because of its horrible software iTunes . It messed up the firmware on the device several times , it would complain constantly that it is not up to date and then try to update it which resuted in several crashes.The most horrible thing however was that it would mess up your MP3 music collection in a way that can never be undone . I had orgaized my collection in the file system nicely by genre , author , album etc , and this thing messed up everything . I have another mp3 player - iRiver - which I reccommend as a lot better than the iPod anyway - and I wanted to be able to copy things on it from my library . Now i am not able to and have to go back and re-organize the mess manually ! .I do not recommend the iPod and I do not recommend using their software either .	-1
Overall - there are far better mp3 players out there for the same money . Do n't buy this one.. keep looking . This player REQUIRES the use of iTunes meaning that one ca n't just drag and drop music into the player . This means installing this bulky virus/software and waiting for it load each time you want to monkey with your music . Also , you 'll be forced to use only one computer to manage you music . This concept is completely dim-witted and annoying.My iPod Shuffle irreparably died after one year and one month - just one month after the warranty ended . I 've heard similar horror stories so I know that I 'm not the only one to have experienced this.Also , the player does not have simple , but vital , functions like `` hold '' or any kind of on-the-fly file management.Get something else that has drag-and-drop file management ( sorry , that means non-Apple ) and last longer than a year .	-1
I have a USB AC charger and car charger that came with my Palm PDA , and they work just fine with my Nano . Do n't waste your money supporting Apple when it charges $ 30 for basically a piece of plastic .	-1
Why would anyone get this type of charger ? For about $ 40 , you can get an `` isupercharger '' that you can plug into the wall , plug into a car lighter , plug into a USB port , or run off of a 9 volt battery . With the 9 volt battery option , you can use your iPod all you want , even on a long airplane flight or when you are camping . It 's a small , all-in-one design . I do n't want to carry a bunch of different adapters with me when I take my iPod along .	-1
After using a 50pack of Memorex successfully , I decided to give Sony a try based on the rave reviews . I went through the first 15 discs off the top of the Sony stack before giving up . Every disc aborted the burn process with a `` Power Calibration Error '' . Never saw this error before with the Memorex discs I had used . I tried all the possible speeds ( 8x , 16x , 32x without any luck ) . It could be an incompatibility with my DVD drive ( it is a Memorex drive , after all ) , but I can find anything about the issue Googling , at least nothing that will fix it.Anyway , sounds like other folks have had better success so I would just avoid these if one is using a Memorex DVD 16X drive .	-1
I have been burning music cd 's in my 2 Sony CD recorders for several years now . Recently I bought a 50 pack of the Sony CD 's . They are a disaster . Sometimes 4 or 5 in a row will not burn . And sometimes after one is burned , it will not finalize because there is nothing on them . Id a `` Sony '' Music CD will not work in a Sony recorder , what is going on ? I have very few peoblems with Maxell and TDK music cd 's .	-1
I bought this after reading Amazon user comments . Most of them say it is a snap . It must be . For some.After having to return the first unit for hardware failure after 1 day and a 30 min phone call to ... New Delhi I had another one delivered . This one worked but it would not talk to my Netgear wireless router . It would take forever to find the network address and then it would either fail or establish a limited connection . I tried to update the firmware on my own which is not as well done as in the router.Then I decided to call India again . Sam , a very good , knowledgeable guy helped me ( another 45 minutes of troubleshooting ) . He closed the case too , after updating the firmware and verifying that the stuff worked.We finished with him saying : `` now you can move the Access point to any location and it will work '' ... No , it did not . And it is not because of my electrical system . The 2 adapters in fact talk to each other.I do not know what it is but what happens is that the connection with the extender is very difficult to obtain ; it comes and goes ; it is much more dependent on what wireless receiver is on the other hand . One computer works at times , another not at all ... you know what I mean.All of this with one adapter upstairs , one downstairs in my very middle class ( =small ) home and trying to connect from feet away from the access point ... For your reference : I use an up to date XP tablet edition OS and , as I said , a Netgear WGT624 router . I use WEP 128bit and MAC access discrimination.On this note , finally , I do not understand the comments of the reader who complains about low level security . As for the 624 , the 102 allows setting of WEP 128 bits and MAC address discrimination.Product is heading back to Netgear . I will wait for something better and will continue to move or keep my arms up or knee down in order to get signal where I want it ... My regards to the vast wireless community .	-1
When I say `` does not work '' , I mean the web site login process takes 15-20 seconds to complete , which totally 100 % defeats the purpose of using a fingerprint reader if your goal is to save time . I actually called Microsoft and they confirmed it is an issue , and said something about all the extra IE7 security getting in the way of the program , blah blah blah . Really , the problem is with the DigitalPersona third-party software Microsoft puts their name on . There IS a 2.0 updater , which I installed of course , but still took almost 20 seconds from the time I swiped my finger to the time the info was transmitted to the site . It 's not just my computer . Google it , you will find lots of complaints.It 's too bad , because I really like this keyboard . But I 'm returning it because waiting 20 seconds defeats the purpose.By the way , the fingerprint reader built into my new Dell laptop works instantly with IE7 . The software is from a different company than DigitalPersona.If you need a fingerprint reader for strictly security reasons ( and not speed ) then this keyboard is probably fine . But there are warnings all over the place that the fingerprint reader is really not a `` high security '' feature . It 's just for convenience .	-1
I had an opportunity to listen to one of these units for a couple of hours.Let me tell you something first : WHEN YOU SEE A COMMERCIAL AND IT DOES NOT TELL YOU THE PRICE RIGHT AWAY , EXPECT THE ADVERTISED PRODUCT TO BE GROSSLY OVERPRICED AND NOT ANY GOOD AT ALL.This music system is nicely built for a $ 40 boom-box . It sounds decent for its all-plastic design and a pair of mid-range speakers.It does not in no way sounds `` big '' . There is no magic here : if it is not built big , with large enough speakers , good amp and so on , it WILL NOT produce an opera house-like sound.For even a good boom-box it is grossly overpriced , just like all other Bose products . Any nice mini-system with shelf speakers can give you FAR superior results . For the price of this Bose system , you can afford something that comes with really good wooden speakers , CD/DVD changer , XM or HiDef tuner and then some ! You can own a compact , but capable real high-end system , and save some money for a music collection.One thing about many 5-star reviews here : they all sound like pre-paid commercials . I do not think that the actual customers left them .	-1

Olympus has a good reputation , sooo , I decided to buy the Verve , should have been a bit more alert , why Olympus changes the price so drastically because of color is beyond me . The difference between a silver one and a colored one is substantial , looks like 30 to 40 dollars , go figure that one out.I now have it 3 days , it is terribly awkward to use , the shutter release is too stiff , photo results were erratic , about half somewhat out of focus , and half very good.There are many pluses to the camera , unfortunately there is no point in writing them , today went to Thanksgiving dinner with my family . When I turned the camera on all I saw was bright blurs in the screen , it was finished in 3 days and got no photos of family or friends.To say that I am angry is just too simple , I would love to prefix the word angry with some other adjectives but will not do it here as I would like this warning letter published for others to see.I am returning this camera tomorrow , that is if I can control myself from throwing it out a window , shame on you Olympus.My rating on this product is zero stars . not 1 , can not get this on with zero stars , Olympus , get your act together.Very Angry Customer	-1
Seriously . I had to shove these little things so far into my ear to get any sort of bass response out of them that I thought I would lose them . Fortunately the wires held and I was able to get them out . Despite the vertigo after removing them , they worked great as Q-Tips . I 've decided to return them as I do n't need a $ 70 pair of Q-Tips .	-1
The headphones themselves are really very good . The clip for the cord breaks very easily and is difficult and relatively expensive to replace . But that 's something most can live with . What really irks me about these headphones is the tiny replaceable filters . After about 6 to 9 months , the filters harden and deaden the sound level very noticeably . It makes them unusable until you replace the filter . ( This assumes you remember where you left the extra filters when you got the headphones 9 months ago . ) This effort is rewarded with another 6 to 9 months of useability , and then they go dead again . Now you have to find someplace that actually sells this tiny part , or order them online . I think Etymotics planned this `` obsolescence '' to force customers to buy new filters all the time , and they are mildly expensive for something not much larger than a pinhead . I finally gave up and VERY CAREFULLY put holes in the filters the last time they stopped the sound . So far , so good . I will be careful that my next headphones do not have replaceable filters that can render them unusable .	-1
I ordered this headset base on Cnet reviews and the fact that I was looking for Hi-Fi quality . I did try them with 2 MP3 , A SANSA 8GB and a Rio carbon ( which overall sounds better that the SANSA in my opinion ) they sounded terrible , even after doing all the adjustments , I even think I received a damage set since there was a lot vibration from the right side speaker . Totally disappointed with these . They made me regain appreciation for my BOSE earphones , which sound 100 % better than these .	-1
The reason I give it one star is a major design flaw : the thing is physically too fat to fit into a lot of USB ports ! Look at it . Whose idea was this ? Obviously if you buy something like this , you 're gon na want to plug it in to a variety of yet-unseen computers.Well , the problem is that the USB ports on the front ( and back ) of many towers ( many of the more common Dells and Compaqs , for example ) were designed with a cable in mind , not a bulky object like this . You 'll find in many instances that you wo n't be able to bodily cram it in far enough for the OS to detect it ! I do n't have a problem with Lexar , and the engineering and software program behind this thing are certainly up to snuff , but the fact that you physically ca n't insert it into a variety of towers must be reckoned a deal-breaker . Do n't buy it : you 'll be sorry.However , Lexar , I must say , learned its lesson . Look around on Amazon for `` Lexar Jump drive GB '' and you 'll see some of their newer sticks , which have been designed to be much slimmer and therefore more universally plug-innable .	-1
I was pretty excited to receive these , and none of the reviews I saw mentioned anything bad other than the short cable . There 's more.Most importantly for me , is they are uncomfortable . There are only 2 sizes of rubber buds that come with - huge , and tiny . Only a little kid would be able to use the tiny ones , they just fall out of an adult ear . The large ones are so big , I can feel the pressure in my ear shifting my jaw forward and my bite does n't line up right.Secondly , the cable design is horrible . I like my headphones to make a nice Y . Equal length for both side . From the fork in the cable , the right ear has *3 times* more length than the left , so they hang solely from your left ear . That combined with the length is rediculous . My arms are 3-feet nose-to-finger tip , and from my left ear to left hand , the cable does n't even reach my wrist , so unless you are using an mp3 player strapped to your upper arm , these arer useless without the included extension cable , which adds 3ft.I do not , in any way , recommend these .	-1
Pros : - Sounds decent.- Mildly comfortableCONS : - Whoever came up with the cord design on these should be beaten . It 's probably the most annoying then I have ever experienced in earphones.- The cord being two pieces.- the crappy case that does n't stay shut when you cram everything into it.I mostly use these when I 'm mowing the lawn . I wear a pair of headphones overtop of the earbuds to cancel out the mowing sound . The cord becomes a major issue after any extensive movement and because of how it 's unbalanced one side always pulls down causing some serious pain inmy ear.I 'd never buy any headphones tha use this stupid cord system again ! ! ! Update 1 : 11 April 2008 : One ear just stopped working . Ca n't figure out why . Does n't seem to be any expose/damaged wiring . Just stopped . I have since tossed them . Ca n't really take them apart and repair the without destroying them They lasted for about a year and a half . Not sure is that 's good or not considering the price . I ca n't help but wonder if those > $ 200 buds would die after an equal amount of time , but I 'm not risking that much money to find out .	-1
Piece of crap network card does not come with a driver disk and Win XP Pro wo n't recognize it . And of course if you install the card you ca n't go online to get the drivers because the card wo n't work without drivers . What a waste of time and money .	-1
Fine when it worked but stopped after a week , no point to an RMA because I 'm just too lazy to bother	-1
This is the ideal mouse for a laptop on the go . It iis lightweight and precise although a little too hungry for battery power . Its biggest problem , though , is that it works intermittentyly ; often the electrical circuit seems to be interrupted and the mouse stops working . Fiddling with it will eventually restore the connection but this is not the way a mouse is supposed to behave.If I knew that mine is a defective unit I would replace it with another Targus BT but I ca n't be sure of it ; it may be a design problem . Too badbecause it is an otherwise excellent product .	-1
Well , where do I begin ? It does mate to the the original harness . Unfortunately , it did n't like up with the correct wires . After cutting up the harness , I was able to build the one they should have . Look for another harness .	-1
I returned this item due to poor design of the door alarm . I was unable to find any indication of whether or not the system was armed , so there was no way to tell if I would set off the alarm when opening the door . The chime is not too loud , but the shrieking alarm is ear-splitting . There must be better devices out there !	-1
you get what you pay for ... ... thats all I can say.. if you want protection or even something proper spend your money	-1
The Ez Vinyl software lacks clear instructions , especially computer settings . I have tried it now for the last several hours and everything I import is very bad.I have an email in to tech support ... no phone support . ( bad ) Hopefully it will be my operator error , if so I will write another review . If tech support cant handle the problem I will returnUPDATE..4STARShad connected USB thru router which was causing problems , also changed sound pref inputs to USB Codec.Works Great now ... .	-1
Unlike some of the other 1-star reviewers , I did n't have any problems with the construction or a wobbly platter . The unit looks great and performs as advertised ... provided you do n't actually listen to any records on it.The stylus and needle are extremely cheap . The tone arm resonates like mad . The needle sits heavily in the groove , generating so much ambient sound that you can clearly hear lyrics from across the room with no additional amplification . ( This also wears heavily on your records . ) The built in speaker is no better , and you have to really turn it up to hear it over the resonating sound from the needle . The line-out sound is hollow and tinny , with no midrange or bass . No amount of software correction can fix this . The end result is a HORRIBLE sound not worth preserving.Others have called this unit `` Fischer-Price '' , but I had one of those little FP toy record players as a kid , and they sounded a lot better than this.Why would you buy this ? Well , it looks good , it seems clever , it 's portable , and it stores well ( the case slots right in with your LPs ) . If you have a bunch of junk records that you do n't really care about , I suppose this fits the bill.The problem is , you 're probably looking at this for one of two reasons:1 ) You want to transfer old vinyl to MP32 ) You want to ( re ) explore the world of vinylIf you 're looking for a one-time transfer , this is the WORST solution , as it will give you the absolute worst sound at the moment you most need quality . Take your vinyl somewhere professional , borrow a friend 's turntable , or ( easiest of all ) just buy it again on-line . Yes , that 's galling ( `` I already own it ! '' ) but , honestly , if MP3 are all you 're after , just about everything is already out there , and it 's been digitized professionally from the master recordings . Spend a couple bucks and be done with it.If you 're looking to get into vinyl , this is like getting into photography with a pinhole camera ( or maybe a Holga ) . You 'd come away thinking , `` photography is awful ! '' With vinyl , even more than with photography , quality matters , and there is a HUGE range . This record player is at the absolute bottom of the barrel , and sounds accordingly . If you want to really hear the magic of vinyl , spend a little more for a real turntable . This ai n't it .	-1
You may find the Lexar USB 2 Multicard Reader does not work with your computer . Or if it does work , it works erratically . Lexar is way behind the times on providing drivers for both Windows and Macintosh . In Mac OS X , the operating system -- supposedly -- should mount a disc without a driver for the card reader . In practice , this sometimes works , sometimes doesn't.My suggestion : if you know what kind of card you will have to read ( Compact Flash , Smartmedia , etc . ) , get a reader specifically for that card type .	-1
I purchased theLexar Media MULTI CARD READER ( RW022-001 ) about four years ago . In the past years , it has worked reasonably well . But with the advent of high capacity SD cards ( 2GB and over ) , this card reader is now obsolete . Worse yet , I learned the hard way that it may even corrupt newer SD cards.I benchmarked a Kingston 2GB Elite Pro SD Card using this card reader . After returning the card to myCanon S5 , the camera displayed `` Memory card error '' . It turns out the Lexar Media multi-card reader is only compatible with SD 1.0 specification , which is for capacity up to 1GB . But to read/write a 2GB SD , it has to be SD 1.1 compatible . When I put in a 2GB SD into a SD 1.0 card reader and performed a read/write benchmark , it corrupted the directory structure of the SD card . Therefore my camera can no longer recognize the card.Fortunately , I was able to use 'Photo Rec ' ( a free open-source file recovery program ) to recover most of my image files from this 2GB SD card . I then have to reformat the card from my computer in order to use it again.When I insert a SDHC card ( with capacity 4GB or over ) into this card reader , it can not even see the SDHC card . But at least in this case it will not corrupt the card.I have since purchased theTranscend M5 Multi Card Reader . Not only is the Transcend M5 compatible with all SD/SDHC cards , it even makes all my CF and SD cards perform about 50 % faster ! For example : when I benchmarked theSanDisk 2GB Ultra II CF Cardin my old Lexar reader , I received a rather disappointing write speed of 4.1MB/S ( equivalent to '27x ' ) . The same card in the new Transcend M5 gave me a write speed of 5.9MB/S , or 40x . ( Note that Sandisk claims the Ultra II CF is capable of 15MB/S , but that 's the maximum speed under optimal test condition ) In summary , this Lexar card reader is incompatible with SD cards larger than 1GB , is a lot slower than the Transcend M5 , but costs more . So I see no reasons in getting this outdated product now .	-1
Took me like 20 minutes to figure out theres thumbscrews on the face of it and to put the battery in . Hooked it up to my Astromaster 130eq and tried to use it and never got it to track at a steady speed . One night I was messing with it and the adapter that turns the rod snapped off . RMA 'd the next day . I 'll deal with manual tracking .	-1
I would pass on this and purchase the suction cup mount instead . This holds the unit at the wrong angle and depending on your visor location it may be above the window so the receptors on the detector are covered .	-1
This works but the fuse holder randomly decided to come apart after a few months . I had to get back into the dash of my car to fix it . Basically the plastic fuse housing just broke at the section that holds the two halves together . It was up inside of the dash so there was nothing that caused it , just randomly broke on its own .	-1
I had hoped to be able to use the Escort external speaker with the top down and the music turned up , but unfortunately it 's not nearly loud enough . I installed it under the dash on the passenger side facing toward the driver.I admit my car has a lot of engine noise and the sound system is pretty loud , but even without the radio on it 's questionable whether or not I would hear the detector go off . I should n't have this problem considering that the cabin in my car is extremely small - even smaller than a Miata ! And yes , my hearing is just fine : - )	-1
I 've owned this remote for about 13 months . First let me say , it has a solid feature set and it works as advertised . I control a Samsung TV , a MacMini , a Pioneer 5.1 sound system and a Tivo all from the same remote . The setup is relatively easy ( could be more intuitive ) and it 's still customizable . It 's a little annoying that you have to have an online account to set it up , but for the most part it 's worth it.But now it 's starting to wear . The play , pause , fast forward and skip forward buttons take extra ooomph to work . They used to work great . Maybe as a Tivo user I rely on them too much ? I honestly do n't know . But now , I have to really press on them for it to work . I imagine in another month , it will become unusable.I had expected this remote to last the life of my Television and Tivo . Eight-five dollar is a a steal for this remote . But $ 85 ever 14 months is a complete rip.Edit : December 18 , 2008I was reading other posts complaining about the longevity of the buttons when I came across a suggstion made by Terry Solomon . Following Terry 's advice I disassembled the remote ( six screws in total ) and cleaned all the contact with nail polish remover . . . good as new ! Ten minutes of effort and I now once again love my remote . It 'd be nice if Logitech made it easier to take apart to clean or better still if they provided some instructions . I 've would now give this remote four stars .	-1
Had to give it one star , but it truly deserves no stars . Poorly made , buttons stopped working , and Logitech offered no recourse except to buy another one . I did , and that one was no better ...	-1
I returned it . VERY nice , full keyboard , if it works with your handheld or phone . Though it worked , somewhat , with my T3 , the `` keyboard '' program installed on my T3 could n't be used/customized , and the driver may have corrupted my T3 , forcing me to do a `` hard reset '' , deleting all info on my T3 . It did n't actually damage my T3 , though , as earlier posters noted , using the earlier/shipped driver that came with the keyboard on the install CD.I think I 'll go with a Think Outside brand , `` Stowaway '' keyboard .	-1
I bought this case to protect my 60 '' Hi-Lift Extreme jack . It is completely unacceptable : ( 1 ) The fabric seems to be a fabric-backed vinyl which is far too weak and flimsy : For example , despite treating it gently I tore a big hole in it when the top of the jack snagged slightly the second time I was sliding the jack into the case . ( 2 ) It is too short : the bottom 12 '' of the 60 '' jack will not fit into the case , leaving it unprotected . ( 3 ) It is too narrow : I have to remove the top clamp of the Hi-Lift Extreme jack and remove the handle protector that Hi-Lift sells before the jack can be inserted into the case . ( 4 ) The closure is poor : There is a cheesy drawstring at the mouth of the case that is too wimpy for the stiffness of the fabric . ( 5 ) The hi-lift jack is justly popular for off-road use . A case for it should be able to cover the whole jack and be rugged enough to be strapped down in the back of a pickup , or stored with other gear in the back of a van , and survive normal off-road gear-handling . This case is not at all up to the job .	-1

I digitized my entire music collection onto one of these drives . I then bought a second one to backup . Good thing I did . At least once every three to four months , 50 % or more of the subdirectories on the disk just vanish . I then reformat and copy the files from the backup and the drive works again for a month or two . The strange thing is , iTunes can still find the files , but windows explorer can not .	-1
i ordered two of these last year and they were perfect , they didnt make any strange sounds and they were unmarked ... like they didnt have a brand name on them . well my cat chewed the cords on my other ones and decided to buy one this time around . and OMG this this is hell it keeps making a clicking sound i didnt notice it until i turned the volume down to answer a phone call and i kept hearing this repeated clicking sound . its extremely annoying but then again i only hear it when the volume is low -____-	-1
I purchased this unit to replace a radio shack cassette adapter that was starting to show signs of age . This unit has inferior sound and was so quiet that I could not hear the audio book . I would return it , but the return shipping would cost more than the cost of the adapter .	-1
Whoever product tested this thing got away with theft . The shoulder strap just disengages at random moments . The terrible design of the clasp makes carrying this bag an adventure . You will never know when it 's going to just fall off your shoulder . I fixed that problem with a couple small carabiners , but the case does n't submit that easily . It refuses to stay open at the top so slipping in anything thicker than a newspaper is a three handed job . I tried wedging a thick book in there to condition the leather and the next morning found the rivet holds the joint together , along with its rubber grommet , laying in the bottom of the case . This is a perfect example of why it does n't always pay to by an inexpensive product .	-1
This TV was great for the first two years . Other people with HDTV 's often commented how much better my picture was than theirs . I loved this TV . But now , after having it 2 1/2 years , it turned itself off and the red LED flashes in bursts of 7 times . I found out that is a malfunctioning D board and is a common problem . Scheduling the service with Sony has not been fun and they say the product is on backorder and do n't know when it will be in . I 've found it on a website and am going to order it and hope I can get technician out . But seriously , when you spend $ 2300 on a TV you should not have problems with it this soon . If it were a fluke , fine , but so many people have had the problem they 're running out of parts .	-1
Before you buy this set , search online for : '' Sony optical block problems '' Bought this set in 2004 . March 2009 I notice a blue haze at the bottom of the screen . After some research I discovered that this is a very common problem and is essentially a flaw with the design that runs throughout the range of Sony Grand Wega sets ; Specifically , failing optical blocks ultimately make the set unusable , due to artifacts of many different hues and sizes to appear on your screen.Repair runs to the order of $ 1000 . I contacted Sony and thought that I would get this resolved as they admit that this problem is known and they indicate on their website page detailing the problem that they are resolute in their desire to maintain high quality , blah , blah etc.On my first point of contact I indicated that I did not want to foot the bill . The Sony service rep mumbled `` oh yes sir , I fully understand ... '' .. eh ? I contacted a service center , and described the problem . I had to contact Sony again to verify something so this time I asked directly if Sony would pay for it.The rep said the warranty had expired , and that the limited extended warranty that Sony put in place specifically to cover this *known* flaw had also expired , so the repair would be at my expense.Hmmm , so they know that they have a pandemic-sized problem that shows up only after a while for which they provide a limited window of support , then close up shop leaving many of their customers with junk too costly to repair.Even if you repair it , I understand that the design is such that the proximity of the lamp to the block is likely to again degrade the replacement part over time.Anyways , I indicated my displeasure to the rep , pointing out that the number of people being affected by this is fast approaching one that simply ca n't be ignored , and that I would be adding my voice and review-writing time to the clamor.In fairness to the poor , powerless guy on the phone , he did register my complaint , but I would be surprised if it will go anywhere.. if it does , then I 'll repost here.So at this point I 'm left with limited options other than to get loud enough for them to consider me a pest..I hate doing this because I have a life to live and work to do , and I really like to come away with nice fuzzy feelings about customer service ( check out Oppo for a great electronics company that knows how to make you happy ) .Oh well.. off I go to cnet now ... then maybe avsforum , and highdefforum.. oh the list is endless..	-1
For about a year and a half this TV performed very well . It had a crisp , brilliant picture and more than justified the cost . Then blue blotches started to appear on the screen . I checked the Sony service website , which said that that there would be extended coverage for problems with a blotchy picture , but only certain *kinds* of blotches.There are apparently two design defects with this unit . The first defect has something to do with a defect in the LCD array itself , which caused picture elements to bleed into each other , and the second defect is that the sealing fails on the image box , allowing dust into the unit where it bonds with the LCD and creates a blotchy effect.The first defect ( I 'm told ) is covered by Sony extended warranty . The second is not . After paying $ 100 for an `` evaluation '' which took less than a minute , we were told that the issue with our TV was not covered . We were then given an estimate to fix the unit that was slightly more than the cost to replace it with a better TV.If I 'm reading the Sony service notice correctly , the image box problems apply to all Sony Grand WEGA televisions , so I 'd have to recommend that you avoid any of this line of TVs.What 's more upsetting is Sony 's refusal to own up to what is clearly a design defect in these units . Anyone can make a mistake , but the real test of a company 's ethics is how they deal with it , and Sony seems to have really dropped the ball on this one.We were early adopters of many Sony products -- the Beta video format , the Sony Discman , ( I still have a D7 and it still works ) the 8mm format , memory stick devices , the Sony XBR line of televisions , and Sony stereo components . At $ 2,499 , this TV was the biggest ticket item we have ever purchased from Sony , and they let us down . Perhaps Sony is not the company they used to be.We are currently looking for a replacement TV , but we are not considering Sony , as it would be financially irresponsible to throw good money after bad.The other thing that bothers me is that this 18-month-old TV , being junk , not worth fixing , is destined to become landfill , along with countless other Sony Grand WEGA televisions that died long before expected , are not covered and cost more to fix than to replace . That is very unfortunate .	-1
First off , I 've been a long-time customer of both Maxtor and Seagate . As of December 2006 , they are one and the same.Regrettably after the unit failed , it took me 4 1/2 months and nearly 20 contacts to finally get a product returned and replaced . This was the worst customer service experience that I have ever had . Ousourced support , indifferent management and a lack of committment to basic customer service principles plague their product support system.Ultimately , the only way to make it past a support system designed to disuade customers from seeking out an avenue of resolution is to concentrate on the US based corporate communications\Community relations managers.Until Maxtor\Seagate publicly acknowledges their support issues and makes an effort to resolve them , I can not endorse their product lines.Should you have a product and are unable to make it through the escalation tree on the 3rd pass , I 'd highly recommend contacting the regional community relations managers off their corpoate website and voice your opinion as well as demand resolution .	-1
I would not recommend this hard drive , or any other Maxtor hard drive . After 1 1/2 years , it died inexplicably , along with all of the pictures , music and data that I stored on it . Customer support is through Seagate , and they said the only option is to pay $ 50 for them to analyze the problem , and then $ 500- $ 2500 to fix it . Thankfully I do n't trust these hard drives and had backed up everything to another hard drive ( not Maxtor ) which still works .	-1
It 's true - Harmony discontinued the program guide feature . Their reasoning - it was too expensive for them . There are a lot of universal remotes out there , but the tv listings were what sold me on the Harmony . Zapping through the listings on my remote was way easier than using my cable box 's on-screen guide , and for my tv 's where I use CableCard I do n't even have an on-screen guide.Aside from that , there are serious quality control problems . My first remote was DOA . For the replacement , the battery cover broke off ( a common problem according to internet forums ) . Now a key on the keypad has fallen off , and Harmony made me pay for a new keypad since the one year warranty has expired.I understand that Harmony was once a great company , but it seems to have gone downhill since it became part of Logitech .	-1
These are totally worthless , they do n't cancel beans and I 'm sending them back .	-1
They 're heavy , no head padding , and noise-cancelling works but the white noise is too loud for my taste . Do n't get me wrong , they 're good for the price but I found it worth it to purchase a higher end pair . I purchased the Phillips shn9500 and I 'm very happy . The Bose being a 10/10 , the Phillips is an 8/10 , with this Sony NC6 being a 5 . I ended up returning this pair . Conclusion : good looking pair but falls short on execution .	-1
Not worth the money for sure . I bought a pair of Maxell headphones at Walmart because my order did n't arrive in time for our plane trip . Amazon customer service was fantastic to reship to our hotel in Hawaii and they arrived in time for our flight home . We compared Sony vs. Maxell side by side and Sony was no better than your average $ 5.00 pair of headphones . A real bummer !	-1
The headset seems ok at first glance , but one can instantly tell the cheap foam over the earpieces wo n't last long nor will it provide any comfort . I like a design in which a cushion fits over the ear to keep a hard element away from the ear . Or , if the headphone is light enough , something that lays right on the ear is acceptable . But this is an almost-heavy piece of hardware clamped onto one 's ear with the thinnest of cheap padding.The noise canceling feature was interesting . White noise is gone , noise such as jet engines , finitto . Conversations were still as audible as ever , though they had a Harry Potter nightmare sound to them . `` Is Voldemort in my dreams , or do I have noise cancelling on ? `` Did I speak in past tense ? The right channel quit working after two years , the left channel just died . I sit in an office with these things , it 's not like I 'm mechanically stressing them . They 're destined for the landfill or e-cycling after only a couple years.The sound quality , while it lasted , was OK. You had to turn Noise Canceling on to hear good bass . In other words , the design counted on the noise cancelling amp to beef up the bass . The mids and highs were as good as any other cheap headphone.I am a little bit of an audio snob , though I recognize the utility of cheap headphones for the office , travel , or earbuds for jogging . These phones were OK for traveling , the did n't last too long , and were not very comfortable .	-1
First of all let me say that I am a long time faithfull customer of HewlettPackard , but yesterday my sister called me to go look at her Dell pc becouse its was acting-up again . So when I got there I spend about 2 hours troubleshooting this piece of sh*t. Finally I came to the conclusion that she had a faulty motherboard , dvd drive , and cpu fan . I called-up Dell becouse she did purchase the extended warranty plan and spent a Very Painfull 2 1/2 hours with 3 different reps , whom in my opinion did not know jack about troubleshooting a pc . Finally I got them to send a tech to the house to come and replace these parts , but when this so called `` Dell Tech '' got to the house the Idiot brought the wrong parts . I then spent another 2 1/2 hours with 2 more reps to try and have the pc shipped back to them so they could fix it over there , but they absolutely did not want anything to do with the pc , they only offered to send another Dell Tech . I guess the moral of this story is DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON SH*T LIKE DELL . Your even better off buying a no name pc rather than one of these all-around pain in the ass machines ! ! !	-1
Dell sold me a system that was incompatible . After an attempt at replacement that did n't work , and took longer than 21 days to accomplish , they gave me a very hard time about returning and charged me a penalty of 10 % restocking and I had to pay for return shipping . Take my advice and do n't buy a Dell product .	-1
I bought a Dimension 8400 a little over two years ago . Three motherboards and three sets of hard drives later and I 'm becoming an expert on backups and recoveries . When I bought this hunk of junk , Dell 's website said that I was getting the `` Platinum '' service contract -- a four year in-home service . Within tree months after purchase I needed a service call and nobody at Dell had ever heard of the Platinum deal . It magically became the `` Gold '' deal . I wish I had a nickel for each hour I spent struggling through Dell 's phone menu jungle , repeating endlessly my Service Tag and other Dell numbers , and simply being put on hold while Dell 's people are `` assisting other customers . `` I discovered that , although , the contract promised next day service , the `` next day '' means after the service representative gets the part from Dell , which has taken up to a week to arrive . So much for corporate integrity ! My last crash was a nightmare . Dell sent me the replacement harddrives and told me that I had to install them myself . The drives went in OK , but when I tried to install Windows , a failure occured . Then , and only then , did Dell dispach an in-home representative . It turned out that the motherboard was defective as well as at least one drive . After Windows booted and the representative was long gone , I discovered that the drivers and utilities I needed were not installed with Windows and that they were on yet another CD . A number of my applications needed extra drivers and utilities and I had to quess which ones they were.I had to go out on the web to download some utilities and drives that were n't on the Dell-supplied CD . The Dell people were usually helpful in this instance , but one guy told me that Dell was n't responsible for drivers to run non-Dell software . He started to help only after I blew my stack and told him that the mess was really all Dell 's fault.Lately Dell has begun using US-based technical representatives who can better understand my hillbilly accent . This is good , but it would be even better to provide hardware that lasts and utilities and drivers that run actual applications . Amazon needs to create a star system with zero stars . Zero would be an appropriate rating for this Dell monstrosity .	-1
HI folks , I am hearing a lot of people complain about this system , then systematically beating Dell to death . I am a computer tech and see lots of brands fail . I have heard the same complaint about Dell , IBM , Compaq , HP , Acer , etc ... the manufacturers all have big faults and at one time I even resorted to building my own systems as a way of boosting customer satisfaction , BUT found I did not have the ability to engineer a computer ( meaning that I did not have the time to independently check to make sure that every part in the computer was compatible with the other parts . This sounds simple as most people have or have had a friend that just blindly assembles a computer with hardware they picked off the shelf with no thought to hardware conflicts ... and it worked , but this is not how a good computer gets built ... by engineering a computer by specs and to be sure that hardware will all work together ) I quickly found that having to support the computers I built was a lot more work for ME than referring the client to the manufacturer and had to stop building computers for my clients . I suppose what I am trying to say is that no matter which manufacturer you pick , they all have a lemon somewhere ... the whole company is not bad because one computer line is AND please look at the age of the computer you are beating up ... this particular one is over 10 yrs old ! I expect a computer to last 3 yrs , I usually see them last 5 , but more than that you are just one of the lucky ones . This computer is a lemon , I have seen the motherboard on these fry over and over again . It is due to the capacitors on the motherboard , Dell does not make capacitors an electronics supplier makes them ... this is not Dell 's fault . I remember when the bad/leaky capacitor news came out and it affected Dell , IBM and HP to list a few , but there were many more manufacturers involved with these bad capacitors . I do n't know of a single one of them that reimbursed their customers in any way , though I do recall someone recalling certain date ranges ... I can not remember who , but seem to recall it was IBM . Last note , no matter who you go with , research the computer you want to purchase , do n't go out and blindly purchase a computer because it looks good or has lots of features , look at reviews , look at how many people are happy with that product and read reviews AFTER it has been out 6 mos , if you do n't , please do n't give negative feedback ! I am in no way related to any manufacturer , but have dealt with all of them and none are angels ! ; ( Happy computing ! : )	-1

Thankfully I found my original TX stylus right after I ordered these . I did n't bother cancelling the order , because it 's nice to know I have spares immediately should I lose my original again.These things are very light compared to the original TX stylus , and writing with them is not nearly as comfortable as with the original . I never understood why you 'd really need a pen in your Stylus , so this is worthless to me . I have n't had any problems with the tip coming loose , but I do n't really use these that often . I can definitely see how they 'd come loose when carried around . they are backup . I do n't necessarily like them , but I 'd deal in the event I lost the original for good.Maybe I 'm just spoiled because the original TX stylus is nice and weighty and solid feeling . I feel like I could easily just bend these between my 3 fingers if I felt like it . Cheezy . Seriously Palm , why ca n't you sell exactly what comes with your Palms instead of this half hearted attempt ?	-1
Made the mistake of buying this speaker pair to replace a Altec Lansing computer speaker system . As others have said , not a terrible speaker , but not a 100 dollar speaker either.Bose , which makes some very good products , sold out on this speaker to produce a crappy sounding bass and not much else . At least according to my ears , the 30 dollar Altec Lansing speaker pair had much better balance and certainly did a better job in the mid-high range.Also , my speaker pair struggles to hold its volume at mid to high volume range and really strains at higher volume . Almost uncomfortable to listen to at anything about mid volume ... This speaker system has been in my closet for the better part of two years .	-1
I purchased the Companion 2 as a backup to my Bose MediaMate speakers . Both cost around the same retail wise . I am highly disappointed by the sound i get out of the Companion 2 speakers . The bass is soo pumped up you cant hear the lighter tones . When Listening to one of my favorites Slayer songs the guitar riff completely disappears just like it did on the BOSE 141 speakers . I also found that turning up the volume does n't help any . If anything it distorts the music.I would highly recommend that if you want a pair of `` GOOD '' Bose speakers look for the mediamate . they are far superior .	-1
I purchased their double storage box and it 's taller , allowing for the label dividers to sit up nicely . These are too short . On top of that , they seem to be of poorer quality . The snaps do n't line up right and the cardboard is really cheap and flimsy . If you 're looking for an affordable solution , these are not the answer.I 'll be saving up for something nicer .	-1
I did n't expect much for the price , but the snaps should at least line up and stay snapped . They do n't .	-1
The iRock works fine for its price . The reception is very good most of the time . Some times when you need to turn off the enhancements ( if any ) that your MP3 Player might have to make MP3s sound better ( like bass levels , equalizer , etc ) to get a good reception . I friend of mine has had one for months.But after two days of using mine the SCREEN STOP WORKING , the unit was transmitting fine , but the screen was dead.CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE WORST EVER ! ! ! I send my unit back to them and after TWO MONTHS and 6 emails I still have n't heard from them.I do n't know what to do , I feel like I just wasted my money ( when I bought it was $ 39.99 ) .Bottom Line : + it 's small+ it 's cheap+ works well- could stop working after just a few days- HORRIBLE costumer serviceTake your chances , but before you do , keep in mind that getting a replacement or your money back could be impossible ( I 'm still waiting for mine ... )	-1
I sent this unit back after it failed to broadcast . Irock Customer service department did not answer phone calls , did not answer voicemails . After I returned it to them , via email tney claimed the unit was fine . They sent it back to me and after 2 days of use it stopped working , just like the first time . Perhaps this unit is okay for other users , but it is clear that if you end up with a faulty unit , like me , there will be no responsible customer service backing this product and you will be stuck with a non-functioning purchase . I would not trust this manufacturer since for me the product was flawed & manufacturer did not stand behind their product with adequate customer service .	-1
Let me re-cap my 3 minutes of experience with switch.I ordered one of these last week and attempted to install it today . I un-boxed it , admired it briefly , patted myself on the back for getting such a great deal , set it on my desk , and plugged it in . At that point , I was greeted by the roar of the twin fans on the side of the switch . This switch is every bit as loud as some of my full tower servers are upon start-up.While reading the instructions for configuring the switch I saw that you need to install some software on a PC . I rolled my eyes , and I got that started.After a couple minutes , the switch made a loud pop and went dead.The Good : Had it worked , it would have been a nice looking , inexpensive 48 port gigabit switch.There is no power brick . It takes a standard PC power cord.The Bad : This thing is absurdly loud . In fact one of the enclosed documents is a massive grid of the available Netgear switches and shows the decibel comparison for all of the models . This one was very high compared to those next to it . Had I not packed it up already I 'd share that here . ... also worth mentioning was the mean time to failure numbers in that grid . If I recall correctly , the 24 port version next to it was rated at 400k hours whereas the 48 port version was 100k hours . That kind of jumped out at me.It does n't appear that you can just configure it with a web browser out of the box and the configuration software takes 3.25Gb of disk space . That seems insane to me.Fortunately Amazon 's return service is fantastic . The switch will be on its way back tomorrow , and I 'll be ordering something else . It is entirely possible that I just had a lemon and if I had ordered another of these , the next one would have worked flawlessly . I chose not to because of the noise level ( louder than my server room ) and the configuration utility .	-1
This product does not work with the software Sony provides ( Toast 6 Lite ) . You need to get Toast 6 Titanium that will cost you another $ 99 . Once you get Toast 6 it works fine , but be careful what type of DVD-R you 're using . It works fine with Fuji and Imation dual layer ( probably Verbatim as well ) but it does n't recognize Memorex.May 3 , 2006 UPDATEIt ' does n't work with cheap Fuji either ( pack of 50 ) , so it 's not a matter of the company that produce the DVD-Rs , it 's rather the quality of the DVDs . Funny thing is that I gave my cheap Memorex and Fuji DVDs to a friend and they work fine on internal burner ( Windows ) !	-1
Instructions are terrible . Read and re-read . Not clear how to set alarm . Tried on and off for two days . Finally gave up . Returned thanks to Prime . Spend a little more and get a unit that works .	-1
Had to return because this thing is too sensitive . It would sound the alarm for no reason some times . It drives me crazy . Not functional at all .	-1
It is huge . Definitely not well suited to pack on a trip to Europe . Consequently I returned it . Should have been more attentive to dimensions before ordering it .	-1
When it worked it was really very good.But , after 6 months , the usb cable or the cable connector in the device failed . It can no longer be charged nor can files be downloaded to it.I doubt if I can get it fixed under warrenty .	-1
I bought the Navman icn510 last year . It has a great interface , but it miserably fails in the mapping software department.Garmin uses NavTeq which is considered the benchmark for automotive mapping software . All luxury car makers like BMW and Mercedes use only NavTeq software on their OEM navigation system . I 've personally verified this on my BMW M3.On the otherhand Navman uses TeleAtlas , which is not very upto date and it is hard to find addresses . Navman is a classic case of a great hardware which has a bad navigation database . Without a good database a GPS system is obviously pretty useless . To give you an example , when I was in Houston , TX the Navman was missing entire zipcodes ( Yes I had the complete state of TX loaded onto my memory card ) . Also , the satellite locking times on the NavMan were horrendous . Sometimes it was 30 seconds and many other times it would take 5 minutes and sometimes had to reboot it to get a satellite lock . STAY AWAY FROM NAVMAN PRODUCTS.The Navman icn520 is just the same os icn510 . icn520 is black in color , while the icn510 is silver in color . Nothing much has changed , I just went online and compared the specs of both the units . The Navman is a much worser unit compared to any Garmin unit , because of the simple fact that Garmin uses NavTeq . Garmin is way superior to NavMan.I just ordered the Garmin c320 for my second car and will be selling my NavMan icn510 on eBay next week.In summary , any navigation system that uses NavTeq database is much superior to any other comparable unit , because when it comes to a GPS navigation system it is all in the navigation database ! ! !	-1
I owned this camera 2 years before the CCD started crapping out . I 'd turn on the camera and the LCD would display black ( but it was illuminated ) . For a while , I 'd be able to turn it off , then on again and it 'd be fine - I 'd be able to see on the LCD what the lens saw . After a few months , this `` trick '' stopped working . Let me add that I did n't use it that much and was pretty careful with it . In any case , by the time it totally died , it was out of warranty . I put the camera away and started using my crappy phone camera.On a whim , I called Canon a few months ago and a tech told me my symptoms sounded like a bad CCD but for $ 99 , I could send it in for repair . I asked them how much the part would be since I 'm pretty handy and like to fix things myself . He told me it 'd be more than the service ! ( something like $ 129 ) . Then he offered me the option of taking advantage of three `` specials '' of different , newer Canon digital camera models . As I was on the phone with him , I looked up the models and found I was able to buy them at various other sales sites for less than what I was being offered.Needless to say , I was pissed . I 'd used Canon stuff before and was always pleased with the features and build quality . My experience with the SD20 soured me to the Canon brand.I expect that when I pay over $ 200 for a camera I only occasionally use but take care of , that the camera would last longer than 2-1/2 years .	-1
Be wary of this card reader . It will definitely work with older 2GB SD cards , but if you ever want to move into the present and future , you will not be able to read 8GB SDHC cards . Only some of this model of reader are forward compatible . Sandisk offers up this helpful chart here : [ ... ] What part number are you buying ? Why bother worrying . Do n't end up with a paper weight like me ; buy a card reader that is certified to work with 8GB cards , or better yet , a reader that will work with cards that have even greater capacities .	-1
The original iteration ( the vertical version ) of this 12-in-1 card reader crapped out on me within 90 days , would n't read or present any card , in any slot , of any size.Amazon 's 30-day return policy did n't help me a bit , even though the item had a two-year manufacturer 's warranty . There 's no place on this site I can discuss this issue with an Amazon rep , at least that I could find.I had to buy another card reader with overnight delivery to get projects accomplished.I 've spent a lot of money with Amazon over the years and their intractibility with this issue is distressing . Amazon is convenient , and often best-priced ... but I 'll be shopping more carefully in the future .	-1
It worked for a while but soon I started getting autoplay boxes appearing for no reason . Could n't figure out why until I unplugged the thing . Then it would n't read anything . I 've had better success buying cheapo card readers at Frys . Less money and I have n't had any of them go bad yet .	-1
Virtually all Bose product has an extremely poor price to performance ratio . Charitably , when I hear someone use Bose as a benchmark in comparing other audio product , I immediately think the person may not have enough time to listen to competing brands . Get out there and decide for yourself . Which brings me to this product . I listened to these side by side with 2.1 speakers from Logitech , Klipsch , Altec Lansing and others . All were less expensive than the Bose and all outperformed these overpriced , underperforming little jewels . If these were priced at about the 80 dollar price point , they would be a little easier to justify - a small price for an average product . I 'll make this easy for those of you that do n't have time to shop and listen for yourself . The following products are vastly superior to these . One costs more , the others a lot less . Unlike this Bose system , you can rest assured that you will be buying product that can reproduce sound with reasonable accuracy and clarity . 1 ) Klipsch iFi 2 ) Logitech Z2300 3 ) Altec Lansing MX5021 4 ) Cambridge Soundworks Microworks II .	-1
The reader did n't read my 2G MiniSD . I have another reader that does so I dumped the MobileMate and took the lost .	-1
I love the style with the attachments , but it fell apart a week after I got it . The clip fell off , and the lobster clasp broke when trying to attach the extension piece .	-1
Stylus came apart , the long & Orange one fell off , Black one just fell apart , I really wanted it to work !	-1
The tip is still ok , but the plastic headphone-jack-Lanier broke off in the jack , and I was n't being rough with it . It just is n't made worth beans . The shiny metal collar you see in the photo around the base of the tip fell off and is now lost . The tip stylus stays on , but I did n't expect this product to spontaneously deconstruct . And in so short a time.I was expecting better workmanship , frankly , from reading the other reviews.Disappointed .	-1
Within two weeks of receiving this Boxwave iPad stylus , the rubber piece at the end has broken off from the main body . I have n't been rough with the stylus or abused it in any way yet here I am $ 15 and a stylus short . Will try to contact Amazon to see if they will replace it . Watch this space . I would give it zero stars except that I did get about two weeks use ! ! !	-1
I decided to give this stylus a try , since it 's not a rubber tip and I had seen some issues with rubber tips wearing out . In general it has a nice feel , good size for my hands , but I find the tip too `` squishy '' for me to write reliably . Unless I am applying more force than I am used to when writing with a pen or pencil , parts of what I 'm writing wo n't register in whatever app I 'm using ( PhatPad , Notability , Bamboo Paper on an iPad 4th generation ) . This wo n't necessarily be an issue for you depending on your writing style , but it 's something to be aware of . I borrowed a rubber-tipped stylus from a friend and did not have a similar issue.The only other issue is minor : the included lanyards to connect to the headphone port use a plastic connector , which fit very tight at first but quickly loosened up after inserting/removing a few times . It still stays in , but it slides out pretty easily now , and I 'm dropping the stylus fairly regularly if it bumps into much of anything when picking it up.Overall this is an interesting idea , but it just does n't quite work for me .	-1
If no stars were an option , I 'd still give this a star , but I wo n't give it two.It looks good and feels good , though the enclosed lanyards seem worthless in both design and materials.The real trouble was that the stylus required a bit of pressure to work . A bit of pressure becomes a problem after a while ; even my shoulder became involved , and my hand began to hurt from having to grip the thing.I had used cheap , rubber-tipped styli , and learned with them not to press , since it was unnecessary and also shortened the life of the tip . This stylus occasionally worked with little-to-no pressure , but not usually , and the inconsistency was n't helpful either . Very bad for gaming ! I contacted the seller , asking whether they 'd had a bad batch . They did wonder whether I 'd gotten a defective one , and took it back for a refund . They also suggested that perhaps my screen protector was too thick , but I use no screen protector.I had looked forward to not using my finger , but found it a real relief , after a couple of weeks , to return to finger use.It 's the only mesh stylus I 've tried . Based on this experience , I 'm not eager to try another .	-1
It works but no better than than those that come in a package of three that sell for about the same price . I found the attachment distracting and removed it . I like the Kensington that has a ball point pen . It is much longer and easier to write with .	-1
Upon opening the package and using the stylus it left a oily smeary/trail or residue all over my iPad glass . I tried it on a white piece of paper just to see if i was crazy and sure enough it was a oily mess . Maybe I 'm just unlucky but ill try something else . I tried to contact the seller hoping it was BoxWave but it was n't , it was Amazon who quickly offered to refund me my money , so here i am without a stylus and having to ship stuff back . Bla .	-1
i bought two of these for mine and my wifes new kindle fire hd 8.9 , they are total garbage . for the price they want for these its nothing less than a scam . the only truth in the product description is the fact they do apply easily.1 . the way they are packaged the screen protector has a thin plastic film along the outside `` sticky '' edge of the protector , the problem with that it allows all sorts of dirt and dust to adhere to the back side of the screen protector during transit.2 . trying to clean this off is a bother as the lint and dust sticks to the glued edge and when trying to remove it from the glue , you get strands of glue on the underside of the protector.3 . If you manage to make it past that , three days later i found the edges bubbling up . Now i am talking about the glue edges are bubbling up . I dont know if its from the charging heat buildup or if its just cheap glue but the edges wont stay smooth no matter what you try.4 . Along with that i now have dust again under the screen protector i assume from the edges lifting due to the bubbling.I have to wonder just what is being protected here it seems more like a dust protector to me.Oh well lesson learned money lost on two of these and i will never buy anything from this manufacturer again	-1
I 'm disappointed that Amazon hails this screen protector as the 'best ' for your Kindle . I made it about 15 minutes before I took it off and bought an Armor Suit . The 'bubble free ' design just means that the plastic does n't stick to the screen - the entire protector is one large bubble that sticks to the outer edges only . The plastic is always floating off the screen and does n't make contact until you touch it . That makes for an unclean- and sloppy-looking screen . Returned same day.Pro'sGood fitHoles aligned wellHeavy dutyCon'sArrived dirty ( that was a pain ! ) Does n't stick to screen ( only outer edge ) Looks dirty all the time	-1
I bought this screen protector because it was cheap . While applying it I managed to get some dust and a hair trapped between screen and protector , and a few bubbles that refused to come out . I tried to use the `` applicator card '' and ended up putting scratches on it . This is one of those one chance only protectors -- do n't try to move it once it is down ! I kept it on for a week or so , until the bubbles and dirt drove me crazy and I took it of . I have n't purchased another screen protector for my Kindle Fire yet , but the gorilla glass screen seems pretty durable , and I keep it in a sleeve or case most of the time . I will say that the screen protector did help with the annoying fingerprints that I always get on the touchscreen . So if you want a cheap screen protector that will help with fingerprints , and you are talented with applying these things , give it a try .	-1
It is sooo difficult to not get even one bit of dust under the screen protector while installing it and then I have to see that bit of dust every time I use my Kindle . But even if I somehow got all of the dust bits out , the matte finish of the screen protector combined with the fact that it hovers over the screen , ruins the clarity of the visibility . Finally , it makes touch screen manipulation marginally more difficult . It is not a horrendous product , but it is not great either .	-1
Thank goodness I only paid $ 1.99 for this . It is nothing but garbage ! There are air bubbles no matter how careful you are or what methids you use . I would rather deal with the fingerprints on my screen then the look of this . Its going right into the garbage . I was honestly hoping this would work well to cut down on the glare and fingerprints but what a disappointment !	-1
I 've seen reviews for other Anti-Glare Screen Protectors that complain about the protector not covering the entire screen . This protector fits perfectly and covers the entire screen . However , what I consider a fatal flaw is when one peels the little white tab off the upper left corner of the cover , a tacky residue remains . This not only collects dust , but results in a finger 'sticking ' to the cover when pressing the 'Home ' corner of the screen . We took off the cover and tried to remove the sticky residue with alcohol , then fingernail polish remover , then Goo-Gone . The result was a slightly opaque view of the corner . We used the second protector and merely removed the white tab and will live with the sticky corner until we can locate another protector that does n't have that issue . On the plus side , this cover is thin enough that pressing the screen works without any problem.Note : At least one of the other brand protectors reviewed by others is so thick that it takes several tries to sense the finger press .	-1
My camera and computer both can not read nor format the card for some reason . I 've had the card for about 3 months . I also have a 1gb card from sandisk that 's been working for a long time . I 'll never buy this one again .	-1
i use the Extreme III but after reading reviews they say it 's too fast that i dont need for my ( canon 20D ) so i bought it for land scape shooting.. it works great , but one day i used it in a shiny day for a horse show , in the continues mode withe a high speed exposure the maximum u got is 3 continue shoots.. compair with ExtremeIII 6 shoots .	-1
This item is billed as a Serial-to-USB adapter , but while it installed it does not even show up in my list of com ports and can not initiate a connection to the serial device.It also came with no instructions and no CD of drivers . No website address . Nothing . Really poor .	-1
I ordered the PSC-90 because I wanted the best fit for the SD300 which I bought to have a slim camera that felt comfortable in my pocket . The case I received is almost 50 % larger than it should be to fit the SD300.Dimensions : SD300 cameraExterior : 86 x 56 x 20.7 mmPSC-90 caseInterior : 87 x 58 x 28 mmExterior : 93.5 x 64 x 38mmThe height and width are near perfect , but the inside dimension is nearly 50 % thicker then the camera . Thus the case takes up nearly 50 % more space in your pocket then it should . It looks like this case might be a great fit for the S500 camera or one of similar size.S500Exterior : 87 x 57 x 28 mmI 'm not sure whether it will snap shut or not with the S500 in it , but it would come really close . If it does , it would be a perfect slim fit for canon 's larger cameras . As for the SD200-300 , I hope I can find a better case soon.P.S . I contacted Canon to check if this was normal or if I should attempt to order a replacement . They claimed that although they could n't provide dimensions for the case , it should fit snuggly and I should return my case to the retailer for an exchange . I 'm not sure I want to pay shipping on another and wind up in the same situation .	-1
After only a brief use ( but past the warranty period ) , my Infinity TSS-1100 subwoofer is shot . It would cost almost $ 400 to replace ! ! It is now making popping noises and the red and green lights keep switching on and off . This indicates that it is a blown sound card . I have never cranked it up it excessively , but use it mostly for watching movies with the family . From my Internet searching , this seems to be the weak point of this particular home theater setup . I will not be purchasing another Infinity subwoofer to replace this broken one . What a waste of money !	-1
Obviously the people who gave this five stars have never used an Ipod or iTunes . The software for this devcie is clunky at best . The controls are terrible . The screen is murky and the entire device is cheap and plasticky feeling and looking . Is this really the best iRiver can do ?	-1
So yeah , like everyone says , it 's definitely got features . Tons of 'em . What it does n't have is a UI designed to be used . I 'm not in any way a tech novice , but I had to read the manual twice to figure out what some of the buttons on the front do.I also had to read it twice to convince myself that it was missing the most simple and obvious feature of all -- an ability to browse by artist , genre , or album . It does n't have it , unless you use iRiver 's included ( and presumably lousy ) app . If you use WMP to load up your files , there 's no way to use the metadata in those files at all . You have to browse by file structure , which is made extra fun by the stiff buttons that make scrolling a nightmare.Oh , and for extra fun , the MTP port ( there are two USB attachments , and you need to make sure you use the right one , depending on if you 're loading it with music or data files , one of the many incredibly lame touches on a lame device ) apparently only supports USB 1.1 , so it 'll take a good day or two to load all your music on there.And then there are the aesthetics . Not only is the unit itself god-awful hideous , but the UI on it wastes a nice color screen on what appears to be a bad clone of the Windows 3.1 interface . Eww , eww , and thrice again eww.This is a terrible player , and nobody should purchase it except people who intend to admire the feature list instead of using it .	-1
Was very happy initially with this radio . Very sensitive on SSB and priced right . After one week , it quit working . Since I bought it direct from China , it was pointless to deal with warranty due to shipping costs . I received my satisfaction with a hammer . It seems many of these cheap Chinese shortwave radios die very quickly .	-1
The DRT800 was a great machine . That is until it stopped working one day short of two months after I bought it . I had just completed copying movies from my video camera through the firewire interface to burn onto a DVD . When I came home from work the next day the Tivo was powered off . Well , I thought it was just a problem with my outlet or the circuit breaker tripped . To my dismay something had happened to the Tivo itself . For the record I do have it plugged into a good surge protector . The customer service rep said that more than likely the power supply malfunctioned.Now I have the DRT800 and I have two options for replacement from Humax . I can send it to them at my expense and they 'll send me a new or refurbished one . Keep in mind I just paid $ 400 for a new one two months ago . The second option is that I can give them my credit card , they 'll charge $ 499 and send me a new one . When I return the broken one they 'll refund the charge . This option works , but is a huge hassle for the consumer.I asked if they could just repair the power supply ? They said no.I asked if there was any way to save the hard drive . They said no.I asked if I could speak to someone sympathetic to my problem to make an exception . At first they said that they would have someone call me in 72 hours . When I waited over a week without a call I called back and they said there was no one else to talk to.Bottom line is that Humax does not have good customer service . They are new to the US and they have a small operation here that has bad warranty policies.My main concern was all my home movies on the hard drive . They said that there are very few of these units that go bad and if I replaced it the new one could n't possibly malfunction again . Why not ? Mine broke after two months , how about yours ? Do you still want to buy one ?	-1
I bought this to connect my notebook to my DI-624 at 108Mbps.It worked well enough and I did n't have any of the driver installation issues other reviewers have mentioned.However the D-Link drivers interfere with the Intel wireless drivers on Centrino notebooks - my internal wireless card stopped working and after I got D-Link customer support to acknowledge there was a problem , the only solution they could offer was to re-install Windows . Thanks guys.Also , I 've recently upgraded to a DI-634 router and I can no longer connect at 108Mbps if I have any kind of encryption turned on . This is probably a propblem with the router , but its worth knowing .	-1
I wanted to like this radio . The reception is very good , especially AM radio . Speaker is very loud which is nice . Using the AC adapter to charge the batteries never seemed to work . I tried to tell it to charge for 5 hours like the manual said and 5 hours later , I 'd use it and the batteries would die . Even charging the batters in an external charger , the battery life meter on the radio never read they were full . I do n't know if the charging problem is related but after 4-5 days , the radio died completely . It felt like it still got warm near the battery compartment when plugged into the AC adapter , so maybe there 's a short somewhere . If it was reliable , I 'd keep it but now I 'm a little hesitant in case there 's QC issues .	-1
Good points:1 . Windows recognizes it as a hard drive , so copying files onto player is easy.2 . Small , light.3 . Less expensive than other 1G players.Bad Points:1 . Downloaded/protected songs MUST be copied to player using Windows media player or other media player software . If you 're just using it as a hard drive and copy over protected files they will not play without license info that is supplied by Windows Media Player , etc.2 . Buttons and menus are very confusing . Manual is even wrong in some places.3 . Uses up batteries very quickly . I 'm getting about 6 hours of play time per battery.4 . Battery cover is very cheap and easily breakable.5 . Sound quality is poor , lots of clipping of the signal , and popping.6 . No support for firmware updates.7 . Shuffle does not shuffle . I hear the same songs over and over when it is supposed to be mixing them up.Bottom Line : Well that 's 7 bad points out of 10 points . That 's a 70 % reason to not buy this player . Not recommended . Buy an IRiver instead.One more thing to add : After having the player for about 6 months now , the play/pause button has collapsed . It does not protrude the way it should , but it does still function . But , for how long will it still work ? Also , it seems to me that all the reviewers who give this player any sort of good review are mostly the technically challenged and do n't look beyond the very high level features and are n't able to make a reasonable comparison . This thing is cheap , and I do n't mean inexpensive . It 's very low quality.Finally , bad reviews for a product on Amazon hurt the sales for the product . And so , Amazon likes to keep the good reviews toward the top of the list to keep the potential customer from being discouraged and to keep sales strong . You should care more about the bad reviews than the good ones . If the product is , in fact , good it wo n't have many bad reviews or even possibly none at all if it is exceptional . However , look up all the bad reviews for this product . That should tell you something .	-1
I received this unit last week and I havent listend to more than one song , the unit freezes and the battery has to be replaced to get it working again . I contacted sandisk technical support and after trying everything they say the unit has to be replaced.The only reason I gave it a 2 star is because the tech support is very effective . After I receive the new unit its going to ebay.Look for Lexar , they has a better MP3 player .	-1
This lens is slow , noisy , and soft . I struggle to find enough light for long focal length shots . The noise of the auto-focus annoys me so much I wonder if the internal parts are n't grinding into pieces . And I 've yet to take a photo that 's sharp and acceptable - they are all incredibly soft . The focus is so bad I wonder if there might be a problem with the specific combination of my Canon 20D and this lens . I 've shot a few hundred pictures with this lens and not one has been worth printing . It 's become an expensive paperweight . The 20D 's kit lens takes better photos .	-1
I started out really loving this lens . It covers all my needed zoom capabilities so I really only need one lens for almost all use . However , I started noticing problems pretty quickly . To be honest , I thought it was just me having something set incorrectly : the lens would have trouble auto focusing . It would even lock up sometimes . When that would happen I would turn the lens to disconnect it from my Nikon D90 body and reconnect it - usually that would do it . At this point in time I 'm having another , worse , issue . The lens wo n't bother focusing at all and I have to switch to manual . It will whir and whir and never lock focus , or when it appears to stop it simply wo n't click the shutter . What really , really stinks about this is that I 'm currently on safari in Kenya . To top it off I 'm getting a little older and my 41 year old eyes do n't see like they used to . In manual focus it 's tough to tell if it 's really focused or not . Especially right now , as the critters on safari are scooting around and not really standing there waiting for my little green light to come on.To be fair , the lens is 2 years old , but really , are lenses supposed to just stop working ? Next time I get a lens , which unfortunately looks like it will be soon , I will bite the bullet and buy a Nikon .	-1
After I used it for a week , it crashed . It 's code was not one of the firmware codes that needed updating . I lost the receipt so my own fault for not returning or RMAing . It may have overheated cause I got it to work for a while by separating it from the drives in the cage more and putting an external fan on it . That and I 'm seeing problems with that SATA port . Not to be too ambiguous , but I do n't trust SATA as much as I used to.So possible causes:1 ) controller bad on the motherboard for that SATA port ( seems unlikely , but one of the PS/2 ports went out ) 2 ) SATA header for that port is bad . I tried the drive on a different port , but it may have been too late.3 ) SATA 1/5 with SATA II drive ? Not really compatible ? 4 ) Seagate sucks ( possible ) 5 ) Drives too close in the cage , improper airflow , open case . ( Heat damage ) So now I 'm building a new PC with proper design , proper airflow , proper static precautions ( no more popping drives out of the bag and handling without a wrist strap ) , hiqh quality motherboards , best cables I can find . That and buying only 1.2M MTBF drives from WD . No more data loss ! Eventually RAID 1 and hot-swapping . I got a UPS too to clean the power in case that is a problem , and my new PC has well-spaced drives , 2 120mm high CFM fans , 5 hd 80mm fans in the middle bulkhead.I do n't trust SATA .	-1
I bought two of these 1.5 TB disk drives in Dec 2008 for $ 120 each and free shipping . I 've bought a lot of hard drives dating back to 1982 . And this is the first hard drive I 've ever had fail in my life . It worked less than a day and now all it does is make clicking noises as if the read head is searching for the track , but can not find it . The other 1.5 TB drive is working fine . I bought Seagate 's 1 TB ST31500341AS NCQ model a few months ago and I think I will buy that model again . That model still uses three 333 GB platters versus three 500 GB platters on the 1.5 GB disk . Furthermore , the NCQ ( native command queuing ) on the 1 TB model provides significantly faster performance on fragmented files . There is an implied reference to NCQ on the 1.5 TB model , but I can not find anything in print from Seagate that says it explicitly . I do n't think the 500 GB platters in the 1.5 TB disks are quite ready for prime time . It is probably best to wait another six months to a year for this higher density technology to mature.Update ; I received a replacement unit very promptly , and other than the fact the replacement is refurbished , it works . However , this replacement hard drive is still a little noisy , especially compared to the other new one I bought . ( Originally bought two , one failed ) But it has been a few months now and both are still working .	-1
Bought 2 of these for use in a Synology NAS . One of 2 dead in about 2 months . After 2 months operating fine , got an error that the drive array was compromised by Synology OS . Was able to resync the bad drive back into the mirror array , worked ok for a couple days , then a loud clicking from the same drive.Fortunately the drive is under Seagate warranty , but dead in 2 months ? The Synology NAS is on a UPS and only used for backups of 2 PCs so it does not receive power spikes , nor is it heavily used . The Seagate on-line return process is fairly painless , but who keeps original packaging after 2 months ? Not me ! Seagate makes you very carefully package the returned product or they can refuse the warranty replacement . I have a feeling the other original drive may die as well . I 'll be sure to keep the packaging from the first replacement drive.Thank goodness I was using the Synology device that caught the error and will allow me to resync the data to the new drive once it arrives .	-1
Died after 16 months ( bought 1/2010 ) . Has a 5 year warranty , so I returned it with a RMA . They shipped me back a CERTIFIED REPAIRED HDD with a 44 month warranty . Why should I expect longer/better life out of a repaired unit than a new one ? BTW , repaired unit was repaired March 2010 . Seagate is n't building any kind of Consumer Confidence in their products or customer service . I put the REPAIRED HDD unit in as backup storage and went with a different manufacturer for the primary drive . I should have known better ... back in 2008 , my HP M9250F review points out the original Seagate drive in that HP went out after 2 months , and HP replaced it with a different manufacturer ! I had totally forgotten about that ! To be fair to Seagate , the unit did work great , right up to the point when it failed ( a quarter way into the warranty period ) .	-1
I 'm a disk hog - I 'm currently running with 3 internal hard disks and 10 external hard disks due to all my video processing . Since my first PC purchased in 1984 , I 've only had 2 hard disk failures - they are both Seagate . My latest failure is a 500GB Seagate drive 7200 rpm Barracuda . It was OEM with my Dell computer and failed after just over 2 years . The other hard disk failure was a 2.5 '' external drive 120GB that failed after 4 years . Most of my other hard disks are Western Digital , but I do own a few Toshiba and Hitachi drives .	-1

The shot to shot time of my old 3 Mega Pixel camera could not keep up with my toddler son and my digital camcorder was to large and bulky to conveniently use . The Sony DSC-M1 seemed to be exactly what I needed . It could take quick 5 Mega Pixel shots and movies with stereo sound in the same package . Against my better judgement , I decided to take a chance on the camera before it was thoroughly reviewed by the experts . After picking up the camera from Sony directly , I realized this camera had design flaws . Namely , the camera shots tended to be blurry . I used the auto mode for all those shots . Initially , I thought the problem was due to the camera 's interesting ergonomics ( L-shape when in use ) . However even when being extra careful in taking the pictures , they still tended to be blurry . Mr. Mouradian 's excellent Amazon review indicated the same problem and he actually went as far suggesting setting tweaks to correct the problem . I also noticed that the shot to shot time was still too long ( 2+ seconds ) . The few images that seemed to be less blurry did not look any better than those taken with my old camera . The movie quality is actually pretty good though not as good as my digital camcorder ( that 's expected though ) . However , the convenience was good enough to offset the drop in movie quality . So let me sum up the PROs and CONs of this camera : PROs:1 . Movie quality is pretty good , convenient , and the file sizeis small enough to store over 50 minutes on a 1 GB duo memorystick.2 . The LCD is large , bright , and can be rotated in such a way totake self portraits ( NOTE : There is no view finder on thecamera ) .3 . The size is small enough to carry in your pocket.CONs ( in AUTO mode ) :1 . Picture quality is not noticably better than my 3 MegaPixelKodak.2 . Most of my shots were blurry.3 . The shot to shot time was not satisfatory ( 2+ seconds andsome shots took far longer for some reason ) .CONCLUSION : This camera needs another iteration before being worth the asking price . I would wait for the DSC-M2 .	-1
First off , this HDTV has the best sound and `` could '' have the best picture of any HDTV you can buy . Then , what 's the problem ? The problem is color shift , in all four corners , about the size of a grapefruit . It 's a major flaw , that exists in about half the sets . How do Sony repair shops want to correct the problem ? With magnets . Take a raincheck .	-1
It works in Steamboat Springs , CO . I tried and failed to use it on a trip to NY 1. frequncy # 's not visable in many cars , Very poor reception where a lot of stations exist . It worked but poorly in Denver . for a few dollars more they could have placed station display in a better location or even put a flexible neck on it .	-1
Are you kidding me ? $ 150 ! ! ! I 'd sell mine back for the $ 10.50 I paid for it two years ago . The trick to make this work was to find an open FM signal . Sounded easy , but even in the middle of Nebraska it was difficult . I found it easier to stick with my FM radio and built-in tape deck . In the meantime , this adapter just sits in my nightstand drawer gathering dust .	-1
I live in Philly and I have a 2003 Honda Accord with an in glass antenna . I bought this and the Monster Cable RadioPlay Car Stereo Wireless FM Transmitter ( MBL-FM XMTR model is probably 200 ) and sat in the parking lot of Best *** . I have a Creative Zen Micro Photo and I looped the same song to hear the difference in quality . I tried the Monster one first , cuz it only had 8 preset stations it could hone in on . I was able to get a relatively clear signal 5 out of 8 stations . This is FM , so I knew it was n't going to sound like CD Quality . You can change the stations relatively easy with the single button . Then I plugged in the i-River . I put it on the same channels of the Monster one . All eight of them sounded horrible . Alot of static . So , I figured maybe it was just those 8 channels . I sat there for 30 minutes burning through my gas to try every channel the i-River could get and could not find one clear channel . Mind you , I was in the same exact location where I tried the Monster transmitter . Maybe I got a bad one , cuz every other reviewer of the i-River gave it fantastic ratings . But it 's kinda funny that Best *** , Circuit **** , and Comp*** , ALL sell Monster and only one of those 3 sold the i-River . There 's got to be a reason for that . It 's also kinda weird that ther	-1
I had the impression after having read the many reviews of the various Sennheiser headphones that the build quality of Sennheisers was n't the greatest . I decided to try these anyway , I received mine today and I have never seen a pair of headphone priced above ten dollars that were made so cheaply . I would guess that they would not withstand any but the most casual use . The sound is certainly OK but The Sony V6 is just as good and much better made . Say no to cheap Chinese junk .	-1
I read all of the reviews for these headphones before I went ahead and decided to buy them and try them out . Many reviews commented how small they for normal-sized ears . I thought maybe they were wrong.I 've 100 % confirmed this ... I have normal sized adult male ears the headphones 'sat ' on about half my ears . The sound quality is incredible , but not if after an hour or two your ear hurts from being smashed.I do not recommend this product . I 've returned them to Amazon . 2 stars for sound only , not fit .	-1
The unresponsive tip requires too much pressure to work . It also feels like it has inconsistent contact . I got annoyed and threw it away after one day .	-1
I have been a DirecTV customer for five years now , and my previous experiences with digital recording are with RCA Ultimate TV . I recently bought this receiver when I decided to upgrade to the HD era . I bought my beautiful plasma TV and I hooked up my receiver with eager anticipation . The box functions about 98 % of the time , so I 'll give it a bit of credit for that , but the interface and software of this device are very very poorly designed . The simplest way that I can put it is that the Tivo experience is vastly inferior to the Ultimate TV experience in every imaginable way . My wife and I both frustratingly agree with this after battling dissonace with this product.It 's impossible to fully describe why this product is so mediocre . The best way to do it would be that the menus and functions are all laid out poorly . Nothing is ever as easy or fast as it should be . Do you want examples ? Let me give you a small handful.1 . With this box , you can not watch TV while scheduling a program . To schedule a recording , the box completely switches to menu screens . With Ultimate TV , you can watch TV in a small box in the corner while setting up another recording . This applies all over the Tivo box . You ca n't navigate any menus at all while watching TV.2 . The remote control that comes with it is a lousy design . It 's almost perfectly symmetric so that you ca n't feel which buttons are which . Add that to a poor sensor on the box that wo n't detect the remote from any kind of sharp angle , and you have a very annoying experience.3 . There are only three fast forward speeds with this box , vs . Ultimate TV 's four speeds . In addition , there 's an annoying half second delay between when you press the fast forward button and when the box actually starts fast forwarding.4 . There is no one touch recording with this box . A glaring omission , to say the least . To record something on TV , you have to go through three or four menus to finally get a recording started.5 . If you have a recording conflict , Ultimate TV gives you the option of immediately resolving it . This box does not . It only gives you the option to cancel a recording that you just set up.6 . Tivo has really stupid brand names for all sorts of functions that should have simple names . Your recorded shows are called `` My Now Playing List '' instead of `` Recorded Shows '' , or something like that.7 . There 's a delay before every menu comes up . This box just works very slowly.8 . THERE IS NO FUNCTION THAT TELLS YOU HOW MUCH SPACE YOU HAVE LEFT . You have no idea if you have five hours left or two hours left . This is an incredibly stupid ommission . Every recording medium ever made except for Tivo shows easily and clearly how much space you have left . Ultimate TV certainly does . Tivo does not.Nothing , by itself , is a big problem . It 's all of the little annoyances that give you the impression that this is , overall , an inefficiently designed product without the user 's convenience given much consideration . I highly recommend only buying this receiver if it is your last resort . I 'll probably never buy another Tivo product again . There are a lot of recorders better than this one .	-1
Apparently there are different types of DVI . This did not fit the DVI on my TV . I ordered a DVI cable , and it worked fine . Not sure what this is about .	-1
Worked just fine at the start . Great that it had all the attachments.Then POOF ... it stopped working . Of course I could n't send it back by then.JUNK .	-1
I ordered this to accompany my antenna BUT it did not fit the antenna connection , so now I have to improvise . Mean while my antenna is STILL sitting on my living room floor . I wish this was easier for me to install as I am a woman in my late 50 's . Thanks anyways	-1
For one it is extremely difficult to install , especially on Windows 7 . Since Win 7 thinks it knows what driver it needs and there driver is not in a package . I had to go to the manufacturers web site to get a working driver . The program that it came with still does n't work , so I have to use Windows Media Player . And lostly my cable company does n't support these sort of devices ( which is kinda my fault for not finding out first ) , so my capabilities are extremely limited . Overall hardware is great , software it terrible .	-1
I needed a replacement speaker for a polk home subwoofer , but nobody sells the polk one . It would 've been easier , more exciting , and less time consuming to just throw the 20 dollars in the trash , or under a lawnmower.If you want a device to recreate the sound of a playing card in your bicycle spokes , this thing is great . For pleasant or accurate reproduction of sound , it 's not even worth 1 dollar . I 'm serious , not even 1 penny , and I throw pennies on the ground instead of keeping them . This thing is less useful than a penny . Actually , the magnet does attract and repel magnetic materials..	-1
I 'd used Fuji waterproof disposables before and was n't crazy about the results . The prints were all green . The miracle of Photoshop found images in the blur , so all in all . . .not too bad . I bought this Intova reusable because , well , it 's reusable . I considered getting a waterproof digital camera but those get pricy ; probably the best deal going is a waterproof Kodak video camera ( $ 100+ ) but I do n't know if it can be used for still photos . I also bought a waterproof camera bag to use with my Panasonic camcorder , a little cheapie , but did n't get to try it.I just got back prints from the Intova : 21 pictures on a 27 exposure roll . Nearly all of them green blurs . I did n't read the package UNTIL the pix came back : the camera , which comes loaded with a roll 0f 35mm film , had a DEVELOP BY date of JUNE 2009 ! ! That , my friends , is three years ago . The vendor should not sell a camera with expired film or , at least , they should say so . After all , it is n't hard to get new film and load the darn thing . As it is , I got ZERO pictures from my underwater vacation.The camera itself seems awfully basic : fixed focus , a flash lever , a winding dial , a gunsight eyepiece . Nothing fancy . I was n't expecting sophistication . One downside I had n't foreseen was that the camera is bulkier than a Fuji underwater disposable . This makes it unwieldy if you swim and hold the camera at the same time . ( A plus : an adjustable wrist lanyard help you keep it with you . ) What did I expect for the low price I paid ? I did n't expect film three years after its drop dead date .	-1
The Wall Street Journal 's Mossberg highly recommended this device as a way to improve the range and strength of an 801.11G wireless network.I replaced a Linksys G wireless router with this device and I can see no difference whatsoever.Not that it 's bad ... it 's not . It works just as well as the router I replaced , but that 's not what I expected . There are just as many dead spots in the house and the strength in each of the rooms is no better .	-1
Leaving aside the copy protection debate for a moment , addressed on both sides in many other reviews here , this is a terrible company , with terrible policies extremely unfriendly to customers , creating endless hassles making it difficult to use products you have bought already , including their own.I 've used iloks for ten years.Here 's a few reasons why I hate this company , not including any issues with copy protection in generalNo customer service , no tech support to speak of.No phone support , that 's pretty common amongst dodgy second rate software companies , but much less common for pro audio companies whose customers pay huge amounts of money and use their products for time sensitive professional jobs.Ok , no phone support I can live with . But get this : No Email support either ! They claim on their site they offer 24/7 support through their guided help pages . These are actually FAQ pages which are very incomplete , not covering a large range of issues that may and have come up for me over the years.Most of the faq 's lead to a dead end with no way to contact the company for additional help.Only a very few allow a support ticket to be generated with a form at the end of their faq pages.These limited categories for help tickets may not cover your issue and they are very difficult to find , the only way is to go through them one at a time manually.They charge customers 40 dollars for a dongle worth 10 at most.This dongle only holds 100 licences for some idiotic reason , most likely naked greed.This may seem like a lot , but remember each license is only a few digits of data , these dongles can hold hundreds of thousands of licenses , but they prefer to limit it to 100 so you have to keep buying more 40 dollar dongles from them.If you must buy one , do it on Amazon , because ilok dot com charges 15 dollars for shipping a usb dongle ! Unheard of ! This shipping costs less than one dollar ! Where does the other 14 go ? Into their dishonest bloodthirsty parasitical mouths.100 licenses , why that 's a lot of software right ? Wrong ! What if you , like me , like to sometimes try a demo version of software before buying it ? ( which you must do when the software products cost from $ 300 to $ 10,000 per title . That sounds like a lot ? Pro audio baby . Welcome to the expensive world of pro audio . ) So say you 've tried a demo version of an expensive software package like I recently did with Waves Mercury bundle.The trial period expires and you decide in this case not to buy the software at this time . For instance , you may find the software is not as good as you hoped or it 's just not useful enough for your particular needs.Well , guess what ? Ilok makes you keep that license on the dongle forever ! You can never delete it , and it sits there clogging up your dongle for eternity . And in the case I mentioned it 's not just one of the 100 spaces available . As a bundle , waves and ilok count each component of the bundle as a separate license even though they were downloaded as one product.So now my 100 spaces are full because of one demo and products I have actually paid for and purchased since then will no longer fit on the dongle . This forces me to buy an additional ilok , not counting my backup iloks , so two iloks must be bought if you want a backup.How convenient . I can use my plugins on more than one computer thanks to wonderful ilok , but I have to haul around a whole freaking keyring of ilok dongles when it could all easily fit on one.Of course there is no notice of this screwed up `` a demo is forever '' policy on the ilk website , not in my account page , there is no error message stating this when I try to use it with my new software , it just did n't work and I had to do lots of troubleshooting and research to find out why.The `` non-erasable license '' `` feature '' is essentially a secret . It 's not clearly stated on their website and can only be found with extensive research.So now , just because I tried a demo package , my ilok is now dead in the water and I need to buy a new one just to hold the new licenses I 've paid for.Also they occasionally die.Ilok knows this and they profit from it by offering a `` ZDT zero down time plan '' where you can transfer your licences from your dead ilok to a new one . Most companies would allow this sort of thing free if their product died on you . Not ilok . They charge you 30 bucks a year per ilok for the privilege of allowing you to use your paid for software when your ilok dies.This doubles the price of your ilk and must be renewed at full price once a year per ilok.And guess what , there is a list of software in which the license can not be replaced with zero down time . What 's on that list ? Only the most popular plug in company there is , WAVES ! So if you are using ilok for waves products , there is no zero down time replacement . I guess you have to buy the product again if the ilok dies . How much do waves products cost ? Thousands per title baby ! Do they tell you this when you buy your ZDT plan ? NO ! you have to look it up in the faq's.I could go on and on with the problems this company has caused me and the lost time and money in the studio due to iloks crappy policies , crappy hardware , crappy website , nonexistent tech and customer support etc.Unfortunately I 'd love to boycott it , but I do n't know of very many pro audio software companies who do n't use it . It 's taking over like a pandemic.Seriously if this company were to offer standard professional service levels and customer/tech support I would not have a problem with it.As it is it 's a ripoff and you do n't really have a choice but to deal with them at this time if you are an audio pro.I guess going back to tape and all analog hardware is a way . Expensive , but at least you get what you pay for , With Ilok you pay to be abused and you ca n't always even get that.Worst product ever , worst company ever . Please someone compete with this monopolist ! I do n't mind copy protection but this is extortion .	-1
Decent sound and microphone , but the kind of earplug that comes out of your ear at the slightest tug . OK for a small spare set but not OK when you move a lot .	-1
These headphones are supposed to clip around your ears but they are terrible to put on . The sound quality seems pretty good but I bought these for jogging and they just are not going to work out for that . I would not recommend for ANY sports . Also the connector looks very cheap and probably wont last long . All in all I was disappointed but they do sound OK for now .	-1
I purchased this set after reading the excellent reviews here on Amazon . After about a week , the right unit developed a crackle/buzzing that is absolutely unbearable , and within a month the left speaker suffered the same fate . I generally listen to original film scores and `` classical '' music , both of which are often subtle , and the crackle absolutely ruins the music . One would assume it would only occur with low frequency sound , but this is n't the case . Blasting brass and even piano sonatas can result in the same unremitting buzz at modest volumes ( I enjoy my hearing , so I never turn the volume very high ) . I will send in for another pair when I return to the country , but these are not worth the price . If sound quality is a priority for you ( as it is for me ) , ear buds and these clip on sets will not suffice , so endure the awkward glances and get a set of full-size headphones ( many collapsible models are made for transport ) .	-1
Sound escapes to everyone around you even at lower volumes . Very poor quality of sound : no highs or lows . Ear clip does n't really open for placement and is hard plastic .	-1
I was very disappointed with this product 's performance in real life conditions . The product performed well as far as delivering a signal that my antennae could pick up and play in the desired radio station . However , I was not able to find a static/noise free station in my area.My recommendation before purchasing this product is to figure out whether you can tune in to a static/noise free station in your area . Keep in mind that whatever noise or static you pick up will be superimposed on the signal coming from the this Monster Cable when you play your iPOD .	-1
Works fine as a charger , but I can not get decent reception on any of the channels in the LA/Orange County area : too much interference	-1
These are by far the most uncomfortable headphones that I have used . They put pressure on your ears and after a few hours of usage they become painful to continue using . I have tried flexing them remove the pressure but this had no effect.I have owned about 7 pairs of mid to high end earphones , these are by far the least comfortable ones . I 've gotten to the point where I simply do not use them but stick to using my UE TripleFi 's instead . Sure the TripleFi 's are a little awkward but at least they do n't hurt ! It gets worse , the cable for these earphones is a Y , but because the actual drivers are able to spin around on their axis , the cables leading to the drivers get twisted over and over , the Y ends up looking like a mess . I keep having to try to untwist the cables leading to the drives , but even after a few weeks of initial use I was no longer sure how many times which driver spun which way and gave up on trying to keep the cable neat.Sound is nothing special for this price range . In all seriousness , I 've tried lots of different earphones in the $ 50-300 price range . Once you get over $ 150 they all sound pretty much uniformly better with price regardless of brand . These sound no different from $ 50-80 earphones from other brands but are far less comfortable.What I am getting at is that there is absolutely no reason to buy these instead of the Sennheiser HD555 which sound just as good , have a neater cable and do not try to crush your head . The SR-60s have been gathering dust on my desk for weeks now .	-1
Have gone through two of these bricks . First one crapped out after about a month with errors . Second has just died . Wo n't even get recognized by computer and wo n't turn off . Seagate will replace but return shipping is on your dime . So , I will have had to pay an extra $ 20+ to get a third piece of junk cinder block .	-1

Just like any dog , you have to understand it 's quirks . If using for functions other than the barking , you might appreciate it more . As others have described , the 3rd level of 'frenzy ' barking is not at all realistic , and it is very difficult/impossible to keep the unit functioning at the one or two-bark level before it jets off into uncontrollable noise . Actually , the barking mode does not appear to be intended for detection of an object that continues to stand in the same place . It is intended for a person passing by . If you pass by it , it can bark once ; if you delay , then it will get more agitated with multiple barks , and if you stay very long , it *will* make an incessant annoying noise that does not sound like a dog . If you want to use this like a dog , you have to put it somewhere that people will pass by on their way to your door . And then you will not have the effect of a dog barking at an intruder at your door ; but at least there will be a bark along the way . The unit says there will be different sensitivity in different weather , perhaps rain , etc . I think I have experienced that quirk also . If you want it to work right under different conditions , then the battle for adjusting sensitivity begins anew . Sorry about that.The unit does not see through walls either . I had to find a window with no screen to put it behind.And the only way that I could actually set it up was to buy a remote on/off switch , and power the unit off while I was adjusting it . Setup is tricky because it will bark 5 seconds after you turn it on , and you think you have just triggered it with your presence . You have to ignore that bark . And while you are near it making adjustments , it goes into frenzy mode because you have been detected for too long . Turn it off to adjust it , then walk past it after it has been powered on for more than at least 5 seconds . If you stand within it 's range past the two-bark stage , it will sound like hell . With an on/off remote switch you can at least shut it up. -- -I found an alternative that so far is meeting my needs . It is theScytek MP Siren True Sound MP3 Player Siren . I now notice also aGalaxy SRMP3 True Sound MP3 Player Siren . The fake roar of theElectronic Secure Dog Barking Dog Alarmis just a nuisance . I suggest you see my review on the Scytek unit ; it is difficult to set up . Basically , in that setup I am using an IR Motion Controller to send signals to an X10 transceiver which sends signals to an appliance module connected to any electrical outlet in the house . It 's complicated . So now I have a Scytke Siren that barks like a dog from a custom MP3 file , and that is happening in one part of the house , and I have a doorbell chime activated by the same signal in another part of the house . I plan on putting in additional Motion Control sensors around the house . And with multiple alarms , I could have different dog sounds barking all around the house . In case you 're wondering , I 'm also the guy that put an electric fence shocker on my windows . Now that 's awesome ! I also have floodlights , sirens , and a camera if someone actually enters . How cool is that ?	-1
The tuner sections on this radio are terrible on all bands . You tune in a station and the same exact station can be heard again , a little further down the dial . The mark of a poor tuner . The LED flashlight is nice and the blinking red emergency light works perfectly . For a small speaker , the sound is superb . That is , in my opinion , the one shining quality of this radio . Now for the really bad part : While cranking the dynamo on the radio one night , the crank suddenly had no resistance , like it broke off internally or something . Since I 'm pretty handy , I decided to take the back off and have a peek inside to see if I could do something about it . There 's about 4 gears inside that go from the crank to the metal pinion gear on the dynamo motor . They 're all plastic ! The plastic teeth on one of the gears had worn right down to form a rounded surface . Why have a metal gear connected by 4 plastic gears ? Can you say `` designed for failure '' ? We have a strong weather radio station in our area and this radio did a good job of picking it up . There is also a second weaker weather radio station in our area that I have picked up on other weather radios but not this one . Really disapointed in this radio and am thankful it was a gift and not my purchase .	-1
At first glance the FR 300 ( sold under several names including Grundig and Eton ) appears to be a modification of the very successful FR 200 . It seems to use the same case and it has similar looking controls including a hand crank generator . However , with close inspection it really is quite a different radio . The FR 300 eliminates the 2 shortwave bands of the FR 200 . It their place it adds the VHF TV reception ( audio only ) and the weather band . In addition it adds a number of gizmos.I love the older FR 200 . No one would say that the FR 200 was the height of radio engineering and it certainly has a few electronic warts . With that said its pleasant sound , sensitive receiver and cool hand crank generator makes it a winner in my book ( see my review in epinions ) . When the FR 300 came out I was anxious to give it a try so it was off to Circuit City to pick one up.The Box : The radio appears to be housed in a case very similar to the FR 200 . The box is approximately 5.5 inches square and around 2 inches thick . Like the FR 200 it has a nice handle and it some with a nifty nylon case . One side of the radio has a hand crank to charge the rechargeable battery pack . This pack appears to be of the common cordless phone variety if you ever need to change it . The other side of the radio has a volume control and a ganged course/fine tuning control , which operates the analog slide rule dial . Instead of using the primary color theme of the FR 200 , the ABS plastic is a classy silver and the speaker grill also has a more polished look . Because the FR 300 has more gizmos than the FR 200 it has a few more controls on the face of the radio . This may add a little more confusion to the technically challenged . With that said , the controls and operation are very simple . Instead of using the flush controls of the FR 200 , The FR 300 has a number of raised controls . These may be easier to grasp but they also add some additional thickness to the radio . The addition of all of this spit and polish makes the radio look like a baby version of the popular Grundig S350 rather than a twin of the FR 200.Power Source : Like the FR 200 , the FR 300 can be powered up in a number of ways . You can use 3 AA batteries , which should give you a very long playtime in this energy sipping radio . In addition you can charge the separate battery pack by vigorously turning the dynamo ( generator ) handle . 90 seconds at two turns per second should give you over an hour of playtime at low volume . You can also use an optional adaptor . Circuit City did not have the Grundig adaptor when I bought the radio . You can use a third party adaptor , but this must be done with caution . If the adaptor is under 200 milliamps it will power the radio and trickle change the battery pack . You can leave the adaptor permantetly connected . If the adaptor is over 200 mg , leaving it connected can overcharge the battery pack and damage the radio . You can remove or disconnect the battery pack and leave a larger adaptor plugged in , but this defeats the `` emergency radio '' concept.Gizmos : The FR 300 is decked out in a variety of cool sounding gizmos . Let 's take a look at some them to see if they have merit.Flashlight : Like the FR 200 you have an LED flashlight built in . LEDs are great because they are very durable and use less power than a traditional flashlight bulb . The FR 300 has a 2 LED system providing somewhat better illumination than the FR 200 . Think of it as a penlight . It would be OK to change a fuse or even read a newspaper . It wo n't light up a room . All in all , a useful feature.Strobe : There is also a bright , flashing red LED . It is very cool , but I was wondering what you would use it for . A warning for a disabled car ? A cheap reflective banner would work better . A beacon to attract airplanes if you are stranded on a deserted island ? Sorry no trips planed . How about an emergency signal to attract the Good Humor Man ? Hmmm ... . Anyways , I would rate the strobe as a gimmick.Siren : The FR 300 has a very loud siren . This seems to be a popular ( cheap ? ) addition to a number of emergency radios . This is another feature that leaves me scratching my head . Let 's say you were hiking and got lost . A simple whistle around your neck would do the job nicely . Let 's say you were trapped under a building that collapsed . Well maybe , but you would have to have the radio at your side , which seems sort of unlikely . The Siren would preclude giving this radio to most pre-adolescent boys , unless , of course , his parents gave your kid a drum set for Christmas . Another gimmick.Cell Phone Charger : The FR 300 comes with a number of adaptors that could allow you the ability to charge your cell phone by turning the radios dynamo . Pretty cool . You could also use a AC power adaptor ( not supplied ) to charge you phone through the radio . Frankly , in the later case you should use the charging set up supplied with the phone . The question is , can you charge your phone using the dynamo ? As mentioned above , The FR 300 is designed to sip at the energy bar . My LG cell phone has two separate LCD displays , one in color . It also has a keypad that lights up and ( being a cell phone ) a transmitter . The FR 300 manual wisely omits crank times for cell phones , but you can assume that it would be a bicep building experience . I can image that there may be very rare times when this feature could have some utility , but not often and probably a means of last resort . Likely a gimmick.All radio testing was done with fresh AA batteries.Sound : Like the FR 200 the FR 300 has a 2.5 inch speaker . There is n't much base but the sound is pleasant and clear . Plug in some headphones and you get wonderful sound out of both earpieces . The sound is mono , however . It is clear that the FR 300 amplifier section is of a higher quality then what you would find in a cheap pocket radio.AM ( medium wave ) : Like the FR 200 the FR 300 has a very nice AM tuner . You can hear some weak images of stronger stations on the dial but they are n't too objectionable . Tuning accuracy is approximate , but it does the job . Sensitivity is very good and I was able to hear a number of out-of-state stations with ease . AGC was average . Reception was similar to the FR 200 . All in all a nice little AM radio.Weather Band : The FR 300 picks up the 7 channel weather band which is used in the US and Canada . I was able to pick up 3 channels on the radio , two very clearly . My car radio was able to pick up 4 weather channels ( as a comparison ) . As a bonus , a nice , big knob controls the channels . In addition you can use an alert function . You leave the radio turned on and this function keeps it mutes the audio until the radio picks up a special signal for the weather service . Sounds nice , but do n't forget this radio does not come with an AC adaptor . Leaving the radio on and then cranking it or changing the batteries does n't make a lot of sense . Overall , I would rate the weather band as very good.VHF TV Reception : Chicagoland has 5 VHF TV outlets ( channels 2,5,7,9,11 ) . The FR 300 allows VHF TV reception via two separate bands . One for channels 2-6 and the other for channels 7 and above . Using the FR 300 to pick up TV was a painful experience . As I would turn down the TV band I would encounter image after image of blaring distorted FM stations . On the lower VHF this garbage obliterated band channel 5 . This problem was also present on the upper VHF band , but less so . Channel 9 was obliterated here . Changing rooms or reducing the length of the antenna did not help this problem . I also tried the radio at my office ( further away from local FM broadcasters and more shielded from RF ) . It was still horrible . I exchanged the radio and the second one was slightly better , I now could get channel 9 but not channel 5 . There was still tons of garbage from FM on these bands . TV performance was not acceptable.FM performance : The FR 200 had a flawed but quite useable FM section ( see my epinion on the FR 200 ) . I thought that the FR 300 would offer similar performance , but I was very wrong . First off , the FM section occupies only one part of the tuning dial with the low VHF TV channels occupying the rest . I was estimate that the FM portion is only about 1/3 of the dial making any tuning difficult . When I first tried FM I was shocked at the incredibly poor reception . Our two local FM broadcasters were imaged all over the dial , and I mean everywhere . Even a flea-powered local college station was imaged up and down the dial . Every once in a while I could tease another station out of the mess . It was truly horrible . Reducing the antenna length , etc did not help . I took the radio to my office , which is much farther from our local broadcasters . In addition , the building shields lot of RF . Here I still heard the local broadcaster smeared over the dial . The flea-powered college station was absent but now the local junior college 's station was popping up everywhere . FM was unusable . I saw one user report on the FR 300 noting good FM reception ( Circuit City web page ) so I thought I might have a defective radio . I exchanged it hoping that radio # 2 would redeem the Grundig name . This radio had it own set of problems on FM . The dial was n't totally dominated by images from the local broadcasters , but they were present . The local college station at 89.1 obliterated the FM spectrum below and all the way up to 92 MHz . Similarly , the local oldies station at 95.9 smeared itself to WMFT at 98.7 . It also smeared downward , but it was such a mess I could n't tell what was what . It was clear that the way that this particular radio `` fix '' the multiple image problem was to turn down the sensitivity on FM , so even when I could get a Chicago station the reception was poor . Even more bizarre was what happened when I tuned around 100 MHz . There , I started to receive VHF aircraft traffic , I do n't live near any commercial airport.I love radios , I collect them and play around with them . The FR 300 has , by far , the worst FM reception of any radio that I have ever used , including cheapo pocket radios . This appears to be partly due to poor quality control ( two radios with two different problems ) but I also suspect design flaws.As a radio collector I 'm about to do something that I never do , I 'm going to return this radio for a refund . All the bells and whistles and gizmos are useless if you ca n't use a major portion of a radio ( the FM band ) . As more people review this radio I will be curious with the results . If lots of people like the FM portion of the radio it is likely that this is a QC issue that will eventually get resolved ( and I just happened to get two bad radios ) . I addition , I have to wonder about the logic of including functions , like the weather alert option , but not including an AC adaptor as standard equipment . With the myriad of portable radios available , including the nice FR 200 , I ca n't image why anyone would buy this radio . Definitely , not recommended .	-1
Especially for that inflated price.The VHS-C would n't load onto the adapter properly.I decided to settle for a motorized adapter .	-1
Before buying this product you absolutely have to go on the web site and try to find out if they support your printer . Their web site is absolutely atrocious . It is so slow and constantly refreshes so it is almost useless . They have a link on the back of the box to a list of compatible printers so go directly to it . I have an HP G85 OfficeJet multi-function printer and the setup did not work at all . The tech support was useless . They kept trying to ask me what brand of computers I had on the network and what my ISP was . None of this mattered except to the marketing department . It drove me nuts . After 5 phone calls I finally got hold of a technical support person that confirmed my printer was not compatible.Separately , even if you have a compatible printer you should be aware of a serious bug in the software if you use 128 bit WEP security for your wireless network like we do . Unless your network uses key 1 ( of 4 ) you can not hook the print server into your wireless network . There are radio buttons to support the other keys but they do not work . Tech support acknowledged the issue.All in all a horrible experience . It 's a shame because their wireless routers are almost decent .	-1
This was my first , and only , purchase of a Linksys product . I unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer , then hooked it up to another printer , only to have it die just out of warranty . A completely worthless piece of Chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer does n't even stand behind it .	-1
Love Grado 's sound ... it 's too bad they do n't put the attention to quality on the construction of the earphones that they do on sound quality.Earpiece falling off the mounting stalk . I guess I should be happy these fall apart so quickly , because I can return under warranty .	-1
send it back for a refund	-1

I worked for 4 different national electronics retailers , and I can honestly say that Monster cables are overpriced . 90 % overpriced . Every year , they ( monster ) would have a contest where we could get all the Monster Products we could buy at 90 % off , if we sold X amount of product . At 90 % off , Monster still made money.For example , I purchased the top of the line Z series , and the picture quality WAS THE SAME AS THE PACK IN CABLES . No difference whatsoever.Only place where cables made a difference was with audio . Speaker cables definitely sound better when bigger.Oh , and the THX label means nothing , except more money for Monster . It 's the SAME cable as the non-THX label . I 've seen both cut in 1/2 . They are identical .	-1
My uncle has one of these , and it has LITERALLY a million scratched . The screen looks primitive and unlike the usually technologically up-to-date stuff that Apple makes.The screen does n't light up , and the Hold button get stuck.He almost bought me a mini , as a gift , but surprised me with a nano , and I 'm glad he did . The mini is a defective little gadget with many flaws . ( I 'd rather have a shuffle with no screen . )	-1
IPod mini is the must have gadget of the 21st century . Apple really has no competition because there 's no other player that 's as good . Sound quality is excellent and the size is compact . Completely intuitive interface . iTunes is a great music software and the mini 's screen is beautiful , but all that is defeated by the fact that the quality is n't great . The mini has a major defect in it 's click wheel , it breaks . I 'm a adult user who uses it about 1/2 hour a day when I walk my dog and it did n't last a year . That 's a short time considering I paid hundreds of dollar for the item . Almost every ipod owner I know had issues after about a year and the repair service is almost non existent . The ipod is great if your rich enough to buy a new one every year but for someone thinking that this will be the last player they buy for awhile is mistaken .	-1
SEE UPDATE BELOW : Seems I was stuck twice with an unreliable one : ( I got the Mini for a Media Center PC and for that it is more than enough PC to do the job . As a desktop PC it would be very good for day to day business tasks ( email , Word , Web , media ) but do n't expect it to play 3D games other than Flash Games . The graphics card is not very capable even compared to the grahics chips used in the rest of the line of Macs . It is very capable of HD video though so that is not an issue . Who buys a Mac for games anyway ... If you are getting this for a desktop , I would strongly suggest that you skip the Apple keyword and mouse , which look great , but are just plain bad in the agronomics department . Go with a decent USB Mouse/Keyboard setup from Logitech ( the Wave is nice ) .One more warning , the thing is sealed tight , so if you put sensitive data on it , you will want to wipe if before shipping it out etc . So I highly recommend creating a second partition for data so that the OS ( OS X ) sits on one partition and you home directory ( account ) and data sit on the second . Thats easy enough to do but honestly , it should come configured with the user folder on a second partition anyway because it just makes good sense . That way you can just back ( or use Time Machine ) on that folder and do a clean re-install when things go bad or you just want a fresh install or erase the data partition if you need to take it in for a repair.Because you can not take the drive out of it or upgrade it , it does have some serious limitations long term but if you want a very slick and pretty fast/small PC and want to try out OS X , this is a good choice.Keep in mind , you can spend less money on a small Linux or Windows PC but for the less tech savvy this would make the better choice.Being a long time Windows user , it took a bit to get used to but I am also a long time UNIX/BSD fan so having that under the hood is very nice . The Menu interface to the apps also has a more consistent presentation which is really nice . There are certainly some GUI issues with OS X but in general I find the design much more thought out than Windows.UPDATE : Reliability IssuesThe Mac Mini I purchased crapped out after about 3 months . No big deal , it happens . So I returned if for a replacement . After a little over a year ( no more warranty ) the replacement ( it was a different one ) died as well . Now its a paper weight and I am not sure its worth fixing . I may send it in for repair but I now suspect that that Mac Mini ( much like the Xbox ) is plagued with heat issues in the design . I would have to downgrade the review based on these issues if I were to review it today . I always though Apple hardware got high marks in reliability but perhaps not with the mini .	-1
I would have given this card 4 stars had it not ruined my newly built computer for 4 months . I built a 1350 dollar computer by myself with all the most fancy and nice hardware . On paper my computer should have run super fast like lightning ! However i found myself waiting over 3 minutes to open word files , as cpu uptime got longer it would dramatically slow down performance , and it got to the point where i needed to restart every 3-4 hours.Finally after 4 months of usage i got sick and tired and tested every piece of hardware , software , and driver . Eventually i figured out that it was the X-Fi software that was bundled with the soundcard . A process that was called DLLML was eating up all of my resources and causing all of my frustration . I had to dig into some forums and found out a way to stop this process from running at startup.Now 4 months later i finally have a completely stable and lightning fast system as it should be . Imagine spending 1350 dollars and the computer runs slower than your older cpu.Please beware of this issue , i have no problems with the card it self but the software is just unacceptable . Creative really dropped the ball on this one .	-1

I was getting all kinds of blue screens in Windows 7 . When I ran Memtest86+ , I got literally thousands and thousands of errors . I ran the same test on another machine with identical motherboards , and I had no errors . I run Corsair memory in the other machine.Just to make sure that the Crucial was the problem , I removed my good Corsair memory from the other machine and substituted in the Crucial . Again , thousands of errors.Wish I 'd bought Corsair again . . .	-1
It works at the beginning . Then it start to on & off automatically . I upgrade my driver and re-install my memory . Works for a while and then start to off again . Remove it and not worth the money .	-1
This was a great product in the 1980s when I first started using them.Now there are much better systems around but if you already have the technology , then you must.Although the vendor was HORRIBLE and dishonest , the product is still workable.Would recommend the active bridge if you live in a 3 phase powered house as they do not work across power phases.EG if the controller is on the positive phase and the lamp or unit is on the other phase , it wo n't work or will be intermittent.ALSO can get interference and the light go on or off without command.But as I said before , it 's 30 year old technology but if you already have many units then go for it.Also sold as Admiral , Radio Shack and others .	-1
For this one I will get straight to the point , I own three of these batteries and they are all crap . In fact , one of the three is brand-new and still can not hold a charge , save yourself some money and buy normal single NIMH rechargeable batteries , I use Duracell myself and they work great , now I can finally enjoy my camera .	-1
I 'd really like my money back for this mouse -- it works , but is jumpy as heck with my Powerbook , feeling like a ball mouse with dirty contacts .

I have other products from ZIp Linq and all have served me well over the years . This particular product was a real let down . It retracts only intermittently . A short developed at one end of the cable which resulted in my having to wiggle the connector to get it to work . One day the wire just came off in my hand , leaving the connector in my ipad . If I had been using this item regularly I can understand it failing over time . The truth of the matter -- I used this probably a dozen times total before it went belly up . The wire is thin , which I suppose contributes to its compactness but I 'm guessing it 's also what led to the shorting problem . Overall , really sub par . I am a bit surprised as Zip Linq is usually a dependable brand . I have carried their retractable USB and 30pin ipod/iphone cables for years . This one was a dud . It 's possible I got a defective one , but my money 's on poor design . Hard to fathom , given how incredibly simple this should be to get right . Left me feeling frustrated . My advice , just get a heavier gauge straight cable . That is virtually impossible to screw up .	-1
Fail . This only worked for a short while and the sound quality was horrible . Sound got static-y and then faded to nothing . The retractable feature is nice , but that 's about it ... .	-1
Bought this item in 2008 to connect an iPod touch to a port on my car audio system . Worked pretty much as advertised . But after very infrequent use ( once a month maybe ) , I started noticing recently that only one channel was working ( right speaker only ) . The issue is that a wire had become frayed at one jack-end . So it is now useless . These did not receive rough treatment . The issue seems to be the very thin gauge wire ( 20 I would guess ) , which may be good for retractability , but turned out to be bad for durability . So I am back on Amazon now shopping for a replacement . ( As a side note , the mechanism to retract the wire is n't exactly easy to use -- it usually takes a full tugs to get it to work right , like a pull-cord on a set of cheap window blinds ) .	-1
I tried this as others suggested . It did install correctly -- not using the supplied disc.It will not link with my palm Z22 with IR . I wrote cables unlimited and they confirmed it will not work with W7 64 bit . Not sure why others had success , wish I had similar results .	-1
Tried for several hours on 2 different Vista PCs to get this thing up and running with a Polar F55 HRM . Same errors message on both machines no matter what process I used . No instructions for Vista on the ( extremely outdated , poorly written ) manuals on the disk and no instructions whatsoever on Cables Unlimited website even though they had a link for manuals . It just links to a blank page . The package stated Vista compatible but I would beg to differ.I ca n't recommend it . Due to the wide range of reviews I would have to come to the conclusion the product is not consistent . It even averages 2 out of 5 stars on its own website . I probably could make it work eventually but any product that requires one to jump through numerous hoops when it should be simple plug & play functionality is not worth the price.I already printed out my return label . Now I 'm gon na roll back and scan both machines for walmare least their software sends personal info back to China .	-1
I have a Dell Inspiron 8000 with failing fans , so I decided to get a chillhub to try to relieve the pc fans . I am just trying to keep everything working for a few more months , as I will be buying a new pc . I liked the chillhub at first , can not really tell if they kept things cooler , as I do not have any temperature software loaded.I only give this two stars because the fans are now making a loud grinding noise that is unbearable . I use my pc every day for 6-8 hours , so maybe I burned it out.I think I am just going to buy a $ 10 desktop fan and shoot it at the side of the laptop and not get another one of these .	-1
Somehow , I thought that a product made to work with a laptop would be fairly quiet , or at least offer variable speed so that most of the time it would whisper . I played with this for about 10 minutes and will now just put it on eBay ... it makes a quiet MacBook Pro sound like an old PC while raising it to an uncomfortable height . Fellow Mac users , try this first : smcFanControl ( Google it ) . It 's an app that lets you set the minimum fan speed , and has dropped my average CPU temp by about 15 degrees . I found it after ordering the Chillhub.Later note : Although loud , I have reached for this a couple of times when the laptop is working hard and heating up , and it DOES cool very dramatically . I just wish it had a speed control .	-1
Warning ! This is not intended for use with a gen 5 iPod.It was designed for the gen 4 and is being passed off as a gen 5 product.You have been warned . That is all .	-1
I would not recommend this product . It is made very cheaply . After owning it for less than 2 months , and using it about 15 times , the play/pause button broke off and the unit does n't work . I am an adult and the unit has been treated well . The parts are very cheap plastic . I also had problems with skipping and sometimes disc spinning with no audio coming out but those problems were remedied when I removed the disc and started over.I have yet to send it in for replacement.If it had not been so poorly made , I would have been happy . I liked the built in speakers . They are not great but for the size , it did n't matter . I used it to listen to meditation music at bedtime , near my bed , with no electric cord , just what I wanted and I did n't need great speakers for that . So I could overlook the limited volume and sound quality if the unit had continued to work.It is disgusting to me that we live in such a throw-away society and manufacturers are not held to higher quality standards.ND in nyc	-1
I am about 25 miles as the crow flys from the nearest digital broadcast . After only receiveing analog uhf signals I called Terk Tech Support . They told me that this unit is designed for reflected `` in city '' signals only ; plus there may have been something wrong with the unit , so much for that , returned it . I went to a standard inexpensive uhf antenna and it worked fine . I have since found that you do not need a special antenna for HD-Digital signals , the standrd ones work fine , you just have to be within range . In my case the uhf digital signal is clear and the analog is poor .	-1

The marketing advertisement on Amazon was misleading ; it does not fit an Olympus Pen E-PL1 . When I asked on the blog before purchase about compatibility for the Olympus Pen E-PL1 , the responses were contradictory . When I received it , it obviously did not fit . The website advertisement has a compatibility chart , and it does not have the PL 1 on the list to say yeh or neigh . I say neigh.I returned the lens , which I am happy to say was easy and smooth . I have ordered a different lens that is 'supposed ' to be compatible .	-1
I had one eight months and was on my third unit when I sold it . The unit runs very hot and is prone to touch-screen and hard drive failures . My first unit generated an audio squeal that was somewhat improved in my second unit . All units appeared slightly different . I have read nothing indicating the units are now more reliable.Although the display is big and bright the resolution is too low for a display this size.The iWay is difficult to program as there is no predictive text entry incorporating expected features such as auto-complete and drop-down menus.There is no facility to import external data , such as your address book , or do trip planning from your PC.It has no avoid or detour feature making it hard to override . Version 1.3 of the software did not allow a route programming via multiple stops . It was the iWay 's way or no way . This reportedly is fixed in version 1.4 . It still has no avoid/detour function.My biggest gripe was that it can not be used as a moving map as it displays the names of cross-streets on a random and unpredictable basis . Sometimes street signs are missing or unreadable . It would be nice if the iWay would step up and fill in the blanks for you . It doesn't.The MP3 player worked , but not well . I used it hard-wired into my AUX circuit on my factory Bose system . To overcome the squeal and over-attenuation , I installed a PIE pre-amp and two noise filters . Performance was acceptable , but then , I 'm not an audiophile.Lowrance customer support blamed the audio squeal on my vehicle yet it squealed with the ignition off or on my lap in the living room . When it would stall sitting on the dashboard , in air-conditioning on a hot day , they suggested I sit it on a white cloth.Exchanging your unit for a replacement is prompt provided they have inventory in stock.I score it a ten on looks and a four on what is really important .	-1
The reason I rate this item one star , is that it is stated in the product description that this cooler is `` perfect '' for use with the Macbook Pro . Well , I have a 2011 , 17-inch Macbook Pro , which runs a little hot , and decided to give this a try based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.I ca n't speak about cooler 's effect on other laptops , they may rely on a different heat transfer mechanism and work very well ( in fact they must based on the reviews of others ) .Here 's what I did . On my laptop , I have istat pro installed ( which extracts the Mac 's fan speeds , internal temps at various locations , power consumption , etc . ) and several applications that I can run to provide a varying degrees of constant loads on the laptop . I also have an infrared heat gun monitor and a very accurate thermocouple to measure the case temperature.In all cases I used the cooler 's included DC convertor to power the fans . With the fans on low , they are whisper quiet , this seemed encouraging . On high , the fans are about as noisy as the internal fans on the laptop get , perhaps a little less . However , the first thing I noticed was the airflow , even on high , was strikingly weak . It seems this unit produces more of a disturbance to the cooler 's surface than any concentrated airflow . Setting a piece of paper on top of the cooler , the paper does n't get blown off even though air currents are clearly in place.I tested the laptop on 2 surfaces , one a plastic laptop stand which I was hoping to replace , and the cooler . I did a lot of tests , with moderate CPU activity and with maxed out CPU activity . On both surfaces , and in the case where the cooler 's fans were off vs at max , the case temperature on the laptop and the laptop 's internal temperatures were all within 1 % . The laptop 's internal fan speeds were no different when the laptop was on the cooler vs on the plastic stand . I was actually amazed at how little impact this `` cooler '' made.My guess would be that the MAC laptop , at lest my version , has been designed to minimize the amount of heat conducted through the bottom . This of course makes tremendous sense for anyone wanting to use the laptop on their lap . However , if you do put this on your lap it does feel quite warm . But , the real heat dissipation is very well sensed from the venting slit at the back of the base.I am personally convinced that this cooler has negligible cooling benefits for the MAC line of laptops . I suppose the one I received may be missing some kind of air guide or something , but I could not detect anything out of place , missing or not functioning .	-1
I got two of these , one for an XPS M1330 and one for an XPS M1730 . I have the temperature censor running all the time and I have to say the mats do n't really have a noticeable effect on the temperature . They are also quite plastic-y and cheap looking.I 've given 2 stars purely because it keep my legs cooler ( as it acts as a spacer ) .It probably works better on ultra-portable laptops which have low cooling ability and usually run very hot ( like the X1 ) .	-1
These cables are really cheap . The plastic is kinda brittle . The connection heads are huge ! Even for VGA ! The worst part is though that the wire is so cheap on the terminal connectors that I had to realign them with a mechanical pencil so that they would fit into the connector properly ! Stay away !	-1
Will never get another of these . Each electronic item has to fit specifically into predetermined slots and this gets confusing and uncomfortable while cleaning under the table where many of my electronics are . If they get disconnected all at once , it 's a nightmare to remember which goes where on what color . If put in the wrong slot , the electronic item ( PC , stereo , phone , etc ... . ) wo n't work .	-1
I 'm not a fan of Griffin 's products . As a general rule , they suck . See my other reviews of Griffin products and I 'll tell you why . I do n't buy their stuff anymore , but sometimes I receive their junk as gifts . This one struck a nerve because I 'm a sensory scientist and I know something about the dangers of poor quality audio equipment.This has got to be one of the dumbest products ever created by Griffin . Maybe you 'll be happy with the sound quality and the comfort level . The fact that many people are not happy with these things is well documented in other reviews.The key issue is hearing loss . If you are n't concerned about this , then you qualify for a Darwin award . Earbuds by themselves are high-risk items . They are MUCH more dangerous than normal headphones because they provide high amplitude sound and they block the ear canal . Even without this stupid EarJam product , earbuds boost the signal as much as six to nine decibels ( about the sound of a vaccum cleaner and a motorcycle ) . Often , the listener is not aware of the damage that is being caused . Normally , we hear distortion at high volumes , so we do n't crank it up . With earbuds , you can crank up the volume and you do n't perceive it as being all that loud ... which is a recipe for disaster . Hearing does n't have very sensitive pain receptors . By the time you feel pain , it is too late -- you are already doing damage . The hearing loss is gradual , so you are n't aware of it until it is too late.If covering the ear canal with an earbud is n't wise , then jamming it closed with the EarJam is the height of stupidity . Trapping sound pressure waves in the ear adds to the risk.Do n't believe me ? Do an internet search for `` earbuds '' and `` Dean Garstecki '' of Northwestern University , or Robert Sweetow of UCSF.I 'd love to hear from an audiologist , sensory scientist , or medical person who disputes what I 've just said . Lawyers and marketing people do n't count . Can Griffin find a hack to say otherwise ? Probably not . They 'd be crushed by facts . The amazing thing is that Earbud manufacturers are quite aware of the issues , and the warnings they offer are more and more geared toward limiting liability.Well maybe you do n't like what you are hearing from me , but I hope that you do n't damage your ears further . Truly dense people may want to consider learning sign language.If you want to play it as safe as possible while listening to headphones , get noise canceling headphones that reduce the ambient noise and thus reduce the need to crank up the music . They offer better sound quality anyway . But all headphones carry risks . Pete Townshend of the Who ( a band that your grandparents listened to ) blames headphones on his hearing loss , and the science tends to back him up .	-1
These are a big disappointment and I am not happy ! I used them for about a week and now they 're in the drawer where they 'll stay . I thought they 'd improve sound quality and they do n't - highs are over-attenuated and low frequencies sound distorted and mushy . I also found that they really seal the ear from external sound and it 's dangerous if you 're jogging with them and are unaware of what 's going on around you . They do improve volume , and that 's because they pump the sound closer to the eardrum but I 'm not so sure this is a great thing - I 'd be worried about damage to the eardrum . I really think this is an unnecessary accessory .	-1
I bought these to use with the new iPod Shuffle earbuds . Since the controls are on the earbud wire , I thought I 'd just make them more ear-friendly , instead of messing with an adapter cable . Unfortunately , the EarJams are too large for the earbuds , and there 's no way to attach them . So , it 's back toInnovelis BudFits - Vanilla Whitefor me .	-1
Alas , I received a defective unit ( the sound is stuck on SUPER loud -- but it is apparently not part of the defective units they say that had this problem according to their website ) ... but my wife did n't try it out for 6 months so we could n't return it . I tried to contact JBL 's tech support , no luck.JBL has non-existent tech support ! ! Even though a working version of this would be great , the fact that they have no support to back it up if yours should ever have a problem , should make you think twice before you buy from them.There are a number of good products out there , so I 'd recommend buying a good product from a company that provides good customer service . Not from JBL . ** Update . I FINALLY got thru after eventually finding a customer support # after visting harman.com ( there is no support phone # at jbl.com ! ! Harman owns JBL ) . They said I could return the unit for a new one . They 've given me an RMA # , but I have n't sent it in yet . So , there is SOME hope ... but they did n't make it easy to do this ! ! ! **	-1
I am a little confused by S.L . 's review , '' I had a moment of angst while attaching this strap : Would I look pretentious carrying a point and shoot camera around on a thick leather strap that looks like it was made for a professional grade DSLR ? Well , this concern quickly evaporated when I actually started carrying the camera . `` This strap ships without the means to attach it to a point and shoot camera , which in my case is a Canon S95 . So unless S.L . has a secret way of connecting it , I fail to see how he attached it . I have been sitting here struggling with continuous key-rings and other test solutions , but so far , nothing works . This strap is meant for a big DSLR . I bought it based upon reviews from the people who said they use it with their point and shoots cameras . FAIL .	-1
The sound quality is a plus . Having a bass control knob is a plus . The volume and bass knobs are hard to turn - a slight negative , but not a big deal . The weight of the speakers are also a slight negative . The worst part about the speakers was the flimsy AC adapter connection in the back . The hole in the back is not deep enough so the slightest movement of the speakers or the AC adapter , disconnects the power to the speakers . If you nudge the speaker while adjusting the volume or try to reposition the speaker , the power disconnects . I got so irritated that I used these speakers one day and exchanged them for Bose Companion 2 - because they were the same price . I suppose you could find good speakers that are less expensive than these , but for the most part ( exceptions are noted ) there 's a slight correlation between price and quality . Please read my review on Bose Companion 2 .	-1
I ordered these and returned them . They sounded to me no better than the typical tinny computer speakers . Also , the touch sensitive volume controls are annoying , since you ca n't tell what the current volume setting actually is ( and the speakers presumably forget the setting when power is lost ) . Old-fashioned volume knobs are much more functional ! Also , the main power switch is totally inaccessible , as it is jammed in between two of cables on the back panel of the subwoofer . Who 's bright idea was that ? Also , the power brick is huge -- bigger than the satellite speakers ! Never seen anything like it ! But the main problem is the sound -- for speakers in this price range , I would expect much fuller sound . It 's just not there . I would either save money by going with much cheaper speakers , or step up to something better such the Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks II or the big Altec Lansing 2.1 system . ( I actually decided to stay with my old Altec Lansing set , which sounded much better than the JBL 's . ) Another option is to just run a mini-to-RCA line from your computer audio output to your bookshelf stereo system auxiliary input . You will get much better sound than most of these computer speakers can provide .	-1
This is not what you want to be using for your acrylic iPhone backing . It pretty much just hides the existing scratches by making more tiny scratches , looks like crap when you 're done.The reason I am not giving this 1 star is because it did an OK job on the chrome around the iPhone glass.I wish I would have bought an acrylic scratch repair kit , probably the same stuff that FILLS scratches on eyeglasses .	-1
I have tried this on various screens with varying degrees of scratches and it did n't do anything . I finally gave up and threw it in the trash last week .	-1
I tried this product for 2 hours continuously on HTC Nexus One following all the directions using cotton balls but it did n't help at all . It made couple of scratches worst than before so do n't use it on anything other than iPhone because people are claiming it works on iPhone but it failed for me so be careful .	-1
This could have been a great unit but as usual there is NO control over the BASS and TREBLE . The less than brilliant Bose engineers think they should have total control over the sound of YOUR music . Maybe someday they will wise up but I doubt it . I returned the unit after 2 days . For an AWESOME set of dedicated IPOD speakers you should get the Altec Lansing new InMotion iM7 . It 's the best !	-1
It was ok while it lasted . After an year and a half it stopped working . The switching power supply has something loose inside . I expected better quality .	-1
I was really excited to get this in the mail . I set up the watch and got everything ready to go for my fishing trip the following day . I used it to figure out depths for bobber fishing on a very slow moving river . I cast it out about 20ft and at first it worked great . After about the 5th or 6th run through I was getting some pretty off and random readings . Then all of a sudden , the screen started reading `` waiting for single '' and was no longer reading the bottom of the river . I replaced the battery in the watch thinking that they might have gone dead already . Wrong , that still didnt work . Long story short , this is a POS and it is already on its way back to Amazon . Great concept , but it just doesnt work.The other thing I have an issue with is the waterproof bobber ... The thing is designed to last for 500 hours of in water use . Once the battery dies you are pretty much SOL and have to buy a replacement one ... I wont be buying anything for this company again . I feel that they do n't read reviews or care about what people have to say about their product ( fact after dealing with their support line ) .If you want a fish finder , I would stay away from this one and try another brand . The idea of the wireless readings is a great idea and was the main reason I bought it , but it turned out to be a bust . Save yourself some time and stay away from this one ... I wish I would have ...	-1
Ok I have been using device for a few months now . It is confusing to program and the watch constantly turns on when bump . Only thing that works is the temperature monitor . The depth and fish finder does not work right . It constantly tells me 10 feet or whatever feet it is programed wherever I go even when I am standing to a foot of water and it can not find the bottom of the water . This device was no help to me and a waste of money .	-1
What 's ridiculous about it is that they made its 2.5mm plug less than 100 % compatible with a standard 2.5mm jack.The result is that it 's tricky to use : When I plug it into the 2.5mm jack on my AT & T ; 17929 phone , I have to be very careful to push it in just exactly far enough , but not too far in -- otherwise there 's no sound . Sometimes it can shift by itself , causing the sound to shut off during a conversation.Other 2.5mm plugs have not had this issue ( and I 've tried quite a few ) .This unreliable connection makes this connector ( and thus any headset with a Jabra `` quick-release '' plug ) a bad choice for me .	-1
I am updating my original review ( see below ) , because after about 8 months it stopped working ! Just stopped . Pretty disappointing , as this is the best small DVD player I 've found , as far as picture and portability goes.I 've had this for about six months , and use it about 3 times a week . It 's been a great little player , even at this price . I 've mostly used it at home , plugged in , but even when using it with the battery it works fine . Battery life is about 2 1/2 hours . The picture is very good , and the toggle from widescreen to pan & scan ; is a plus , since I watch a combo of new movies and old . I really like that all the `` adjustment '' controls are mechanical , that is , on the player body rather than brought up on the screen . This makes it easy to pause , arrow back and forth , fast forward or back , and turn a control wheel adjust to brighter or darker screen . It is very lightweight , and I am careful moving it around , so I do n't know how it would do being banged around , dropped , etc . But the light weight is a plus for me since it makes it easy to carry it from room to room as I sometimes do , especially when playing an audiobook CD . The sound tone is pretty good for a portable , with no adjustments except for volume . I have n't played music on it , but speech is crisp without sounding tinny . I am not a `` techie '' by any stretch of the imagination , so I am very glad to have found this nice little player my first time out .	-1
I wanted to use this to connect my Direct TV receiver to other TVs via coax . It worked fine for a while , but after a few months , I noticed this unit started producing lines in the video that would cause buzzing . I tried shortening the power cable as someone else commented on in another review which did not help I even tried using the S-video input with no difference . It 's now too late to return the unit ( The cost of shipping back for warranty does not make returning it worthwhile . ) I will try a different one from a local store so I can return it if it does not work .	-1
Looked like a good device but never worked.This was back when I was trying to connect my wireless to an old RF input TV.Better to just by a TV with real inputs .	-1
Received this today and started charging the 4 AA 's that were included . Unit began charging as indicated ... two hours later I went to check and the screen was entirely blank and unit seemed to be unoperational . Unplugged , removed batteries , and retried . Nothing . Less than two hours of use and the thing had obviously died . Very disappointing , and a hassle to have to mess with returning , etc . Will go to local store and buy a shelf brand ... .	-1
The actual charger seems to be working fine , but one of the batteries supplied with it was dud . I tried to contact La Crosse support about it , and had to try twice to even get a response 2 weeks later . From the reply it was obvious no-one read my email . I have yet to hear back again.So , as my title suggests - if you do n't anticipate any problems with your purchase , then go ahead and buy , but woe betide you if you need any help from La Crosse , because it 's just not there.UPDATE - turns out the battery was n't dud , just completely discharged , and this charger ca n't handle that . La Crosse recommended I buy another of their products to fix it ! Instead I put the battery in a different charger for a few minutes , then this one was able to handle it again .	-1
I like the features on this charger , and it is kind of useful that it is so small . However , there is a major issue with this device . The select button for the 3rd bay got stuck in after just 3 uses . I had to take it apart to fix it and when I did I found that the buttons are poorly engineered . They are plastic and have these very long shafts molded into the middle of the button that come to a point to depress the corresponding pad on the IC board to perform the function . The problem is , when you press it , the plastic deforms and the tip bends , permanently sinking the button down into the housing . I pulled the device apart and straightened it with needle nose pliers . It sticks up farther than it did when it broke , yet lower than the other 3 cell selection buttons . I could n't believe this had this problem after just three uses.Be warned : After a charge cycle , make sure the unit completely cools before charging other batteries . I think the heat makes the buttons deform easier . I am not a ham handed person , so it is n't like I was carelessly using the device.This is a little ridiculous . These had some quality issues in the past with over heating , I have read , so perhaps there is a quality issue with the buttons.UPDATE as of 7/1/2010 I used Amazon 's online return application and it could n't be easier . I printed out a pre-paid shipping label , affixed it to the original box , sent it back , and they gave me a refund on the product and for the shipping label.Mark	-1
