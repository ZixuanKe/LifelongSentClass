The post-it roll has the same quality adhesive of a typical post-it pad , but it is all over the back of the 1 inch strip.I found the tearing/cutting action a bit jerky , so my strips always look torn at the ends . That sort of bothers me . I wish the dispenser had a sharper cutting edge . In fact , it 's more of a tearing surface that anything that will cut the paper.But the strips do stick well and are good for quick and temporary labels on folders , potluck dishes , or books .	1
This tape is great for leaving quick reminders or notes . It is slightly stickier than a post it pad but not sticky enough to damage paint . My wife and I use it to leave notes on the door if we need to remember to take something with us or whatever . Post-It notes usually fall off and tape takes the polyurethane off when you remove it . This tape is just right . We use it all the time . It 's very handy .	1
Great product ! This `` Post-it '' tape works exactly as suggested . It 's like a roll of tape of `` Post-it '' note.The advantage this has over `` Post-it '' notes is that the entire surface is covered with adhesive . So you are n't trying to stick a note onto something using only a small adhesive surface.Note : this will NOT stick to a cold surface . I tried it and it will not stick to a cold bottle ( glass surface ) , so do n't bother trying to label anything in your refrigerator .	1
This post-it has come in very handy ! It 's a really good size for most any little short note you might want to leave someone or to use as a label . The entire note is sticky on back so it will adhere better ! I 'm going to get more to keep all around the house !	1
I think this product has great potential . It tears easily along the cutter in a nice straight line . Seems to stick well . The only problem I had was writing on it . Tried a couple of different pens , but could n't get a good smooth flow of ink . Otherwise good !	1
As a teacher who runs various extracurricular activites , every minute of instructional time counts . I find this product incredibly useful . When a student asks something from me that I ca n't do right away , I can simply stick a piece of tape on the monitor or table and write the student 's name and request instead of scribbling in a notepad or loose sheet of paper that I may not look at again that day . Just like Post-It notes , it does n't leave goop when removed . Very convenient , very handy .	1
This is a great idea . I can not be bothered to go out & buy a label machine.I do not find I would use it enough to justify spending the money on one . So here we have Post-it Adhesive roll . It was great for labeling my sons school supplies . It sticks well . The back is fully adhesive similar to tape . It sticks well to most things . ( Mainly if scotch tape will stay on so will this ) You do need anything special to write on it , a pen or sharpie will do just fine . The green color is easily noticeable . I Love It !	1
Because I carry tape flags to highlight pages in documents , and also always have `` traditional '' Post-It pads with me , I am delighted to lighten my pockets by carrying this roll of Post-It material , which easily serves both functions .	1
These labels are great because you can `` cut '' them as long as you need and because they stick to every surface I 've tried them on . As a bonus , they peel off with minimal fuss and no mess.These absorb ink quickly- gel pens do not smear on this tape.My wife is a teacher and she uses these to label an untold number of things in her classroom . I 've been using them to label storage totes in the attic and garage . So far this is the best solution I 've found .	1
I love this new product from Post-it . The 1-inch wide tape is wide enough to write in BIG letters and , unlike the standard cubes , I can create a custom label by cutting the Post-it tape to the length I desire . I also like that the paper is fairly heavy and opaque . This makes it useful for temporary labels on projects , kids ' items , book covers , calendars , the refrigerator ... Just do n't use it on any delicate papers . When you 're done , the label is easy to remove.The bright green paper stands out so these labels get noticed . The only downside is that the label dispenser does not allow me to tear off a label with a clean edge . I use a pair of scissors when I want a neat looking label . Otherwise , this product makes labeling things quick and easy .	1
Ever used masking tape to label something ? It 's great to write on and easy to tear , but sometimes can damage or leave behind residue on whatever you 're labeling . The Post-It Adhesive Roll is a great alternative ! It comes in a dispenser , similar to scotch tape , so you can pull off however much you need . The bright green color is easy to spot . It 's stickier than Post-It notes , so it stays put pretty well , yet comes off cleanly when you want it to .	1
Always wished that I could choose my own length for post-it tags and my wish has been granted . No longer do I have to buy post-it 's in various sizes , because I can now create the size I need , when I want it . Simple and easy to dispense ( much like tape ) , you simply thread the post-it through the slot and cut off what you need . It adheres well to almost any surface and removes quickly and cleanly when needed.Although it may take me a while to go through the 33 feet or so on this roll - I will definitely buy this product when I run out . I 'm using it for everything from bookmarks to labels , and I 'm sure I 'll think of more uses in the future .	1
I 'm not going to lie . I was n't all that excited about reviewing this product . `` Oh . It 's Post-It tape . Like a Post-It but ... uh ... tape . `` Having used it for some time now , I ca n't believe how handy it is . Here I am at a birthday party , labeling plates of different types of sausage at a birthday BBQ ... next , I 'm leaving notes around the house ... notes to myself for the morning ... it sounds corny , but the adhesive sticks everywhere and leaves no residue at all , so it 's ridiculously easy to get in to the habit of leaving notes all over the place .	1
This little roll of paper tape is great . Love the bright lime green . Nice to choose how much you use . I am thrifty and do n't like to waste so a little tab will do ya . They stick just like the little tablets do but the back is all sticky , not a lot it does n't stick to stuff all over the place I just bend it over the page and it also peals off really easy without any damage.I would buy this again . The only thing it would need to be on sale , or more rolls for the same price other than that I am enjoying it reading magazines and working in a Bible study workbook .	1
We bought a fixer upper house back in January 2012 . We 're still in the process of renovations but enough is done that I 've been able to move some things to the new house.Much of what I 've moved to the new house has been in plastic bins with lids and I did n't want to label the boxes by marking on them with a magic marker like I would a cardboard box . I had been using 3/5 cards and taping them to each bin but that was kind of a pain and sort of expensive using the 3x5 cards and clear packing tape.When I saw this product available through Vine I thought of my box/bin labeling and picked it to try.It sticks great and you can use as much or little as necessary and the color really stands out . I wished it was just a bit wider so I could write bigger . I went looking and found that this does come in larger widths and more colors ! I was able to label the tops and sides of all the bins/boxes and I 'm not worried the labels will fall off and even stacked in the closet , it 's extremely easy to see what is contained in each bin and when I 'm done unpacking , the labels are super easy to remove unlike the packing tape/card labels I used.This past summer was extremely busy for me what with the new house , packing plus my husband was working out of town and my parents recently moved to the city to be closer to medical care they require there so I hardly spent more than one night in any one place . I ended up using the rest of this roll by writing notes to myself and putting them on the inside of the front door or if I was not at my own home , inside my vehicle on the steering wheel so I would n't forget things.I think I like these better than standard post-its and I stocked up on various sizes and colors . The price here on Amazon was comparable to what I paid at a brick and mortar store . I also like that I can use as much or as little as I want.Thanks to Amazon and the Seller/Vendor for giving me the opportunity to try . You made a convert out of me .	1
The best thing about Post-it tape is that you can tear it to whatever size you need . I like that the entire backing is sticky so the tape stays on better than regular Post-its . Also , the color is nice and bright , and I like the tape dispenser format.The only thing I would change is I would give it a better cutting edge so that when you cut the pieces you get a straight edge . I do have to use my fingernail to remove the tape since the entire edge is sticky .	1
I already lovelovelove Post-It and Avery flags , notes , tabs and labels , so it 's no surprise I 'd find a use for this super-sticky Post-It paper tape.I was just a bit surprised to find how much I preferred this for those bathroom mirror **do n't forget** notes we tend to stick up the night before ( `` take 2 ID 's on trip '' ) . The vivid color means I do n't miss the message , and the extra adhesive means it lasts through AM showers.The Post-It tape is even more perfect for dashboard notes ! I can write them on my desk , or in the car , stick them on the dash , and they seem to survive the summer 's brutal 95 heat ... greeting me with a can't-miss reminder when I might have forgotten a random errand ( see photo I uploaded ) .You already know whether you are a super-organized , label-it , Post-It junkie , so it 's just a matter of figuring out whether this 400 '' long reel of nice , thick super-sticky Post-It paper tape will fit in your arsenal . Me ? I 'm going to pick up another dispenser in pink .	1
You can use this roll of Post-it tape for labeling . Just what I did on boxes of stuff . If you do n't have a label maker this is a cheap way to label stuff . It sticks well to surfaces . Just remember it 's not a permanent solution , just temporary .	1
As a parent , artist and a teacher , I have lots of items , supplies and tools I need to store . Unless I 'm using clear cases , drawers or cabinets , it is hard to know what 's in them . The Post-It Full adhesive roll makes it easy to label them . Since you can cut the labels to the size you need , I can fit them on almost anything , as well as cut the tape to fit the length of my text . In my classroom , it will also help with clean-up , since the students will know where to find and store tools and supplies used . In addition , I 'll be able to use them for my daughters and students to make labels for their various projects . Since there are 3 colors available , they should be able to find one to fit their needs . BEWARE - I would not recommend that the tape be used on valuable items , since Post-it warns that the adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift inks . I highly recommend this product .	1
If you 're into organization ( and I 'm guessing you are if you 're checking the reviews for this product ) , you 'll dig this . The post it adhesive strips tear easily and stick to everything ! They come off easily too , when you want them to , and do n't leave a residue behind.For a label that sticks to all sorts of surfaces and adds a fun pop of color , go with this . You wo n't regret it !	1
This is a fun and functional office product . Sometimes you do n't want or need a full-sized Post-It note , and these work perfectly for those moments . I frequently need to put little reminders on my monitor , an Apple Cinema Display , and this serves that purpose perfectly . The tape leaves behind no residue and fits perfectly along the outside border of the monitor . It may sound silly , but I really love this product .	1
Think of these are the top 1 inch of your usual sticky note . In essence this roll is that top inch of any sticky note that contains the adhesive , albeit with a little more glue.Once positioned , these will stay put until you peel a corner to get them removed . They have a matte surface and are easy to write on and users have the option of length desired.Very similar to something Post It released about a year ago ( and which I also reviewed ) with the major difference being 300 fewer inches ( the previous version was 700 inches overall ) .About the only mistake I can see is the package labeling . Once you remove the outer cardboard there is nearly nothing but a small imprint on the cover ( same color as the packaging making it difficult to see ) to identify what this is . You 'd think Post It would like a little more advertising .	1
This is very cool . I have n't found many uses for it yet , but I 'm imagining plenty as we start to store school supplies in our homeschool room . The stickiness is great and it 's a product I trust as I have come to love things that come from Post-It .	1
3M has taken the idea of Post-its and applied it to a tape-like dispensary . About an inch wide , the entire back surface is sticky , but stickier than Post-its , which I personally like . Post-its can fall off , but this tape stays on securely . You do need to be careful when pulling it off paper , especially fine paper , although it makes due for short little bookmarks.The tape does not always tear away cleanly , but like most tape , you 'd have to expect that . This is made for labeling only . The green color makes it particularly noticeable , which I prefer to the yellow Post-its which are not as visible . When you think that you are purchasing over thirty-three ( 33 ) feet of tape , it 's a good deal for the price . The container is compact and 3M has a winner here .	1
This roll of post it sticky note paper works like a roll of scotch tape . You roll out a strip of low tack sticky paper and write what you want on it , pull to remove ( like any post-it note ) . It is simple , strong , and very basic . Not much to complain about here except the price .	1
This product , Post-it Full Adhesive Roll , 1 x 400 Inches , Green , 1-Pack ,2650-G , appears to work as advertised . So far , I 've only used it for labeling food containers in the fridge , and I have no complaints about its performance in this capacity . ( Labeling foods can be a helpful practice if you 're not good at remembering whether that jar of salsa on the top shelf has been open for a week ... or six months . ) I 've tested it briefly on other surfaces including the dishwasher ( as a `` clean/dirty '' indicator ) and my wife 's forehead ( for HER amusement , I swear ) and it has stuck well ( except on my wife 's forehead ) , come off cleanly , and been ready for reuse ( albeit with some visible wear ) . Its main competitor is probably masking tape , which is much cheaper but also less attractive and more difficult to remove cleanly from some surfaces ( like paper and thin plastic bags ) .Three caveats : First , like Post-It notes , the tape is paper-based , and so is not a great choice for environments that are wet or very moist . Second , having had the tape only a short length of time , I can not say whether it ages well . Third , part of the initial section of the tape roll was stuck to itself and some of the top layer of the tape ripped off as the tape was unwound . I have lost perhaps six inches ( 1.5 % ! ) of the tape due to this problem.Bottom line : You probably do n't NEED this tape for your household or office , but if you happen to buy a roll , I 'm sure you will find many uses for it .	1
Where has this product been all my life ? I have been waiting for some company to make this . I just think this new product is fantabulous . I can use this for many projects that I need labeling for . You must get this for all your labeling needs .	1
The Post-It full adhesive roll is an easy to use , clever idea , though I 'm not sure I need it . The advantage is that it does stick securely and removes very easily and cleanly . The roll comes in a dispenser which they claim cuts the perfect length every time . However , I 'm not so sure I like the length they have created . Sometimes I need less and other times , more . It is a convenient dispenser , nonetheless , but could probably be just as easy to peel off from a sheet of paper.As for its usefulness , I like the idea that it can be removed . Many times I have made a label , then tried to peel it off with marginal success . So I like the versatility of this product . They warn , though , that it wo n't stick to rough or textured plastics . I understand why , but perhaps that diminishes its usability.Finally , I like the bright green color and the dispenser 's compactness for my desk or in a drawer . The retail price for 33 ' of label is n't too bad . Post-It should be congratulated for trying new ideas !	1
This is an awesome product , and here is why : It replaces at least 3 products for me ... Sticky notes , sticky labels for creating tabs or marking pages and labeling labels.I used to carry at least 2 of these with me and now I just carry this little roll.Pros : - Portable- Easily removable ( when needed ) - Good thickness- Easy to write on ( when rolled out ) - Easy to see- You choose the lengthCons : - Dispenser is a little bulky- Hard to write on it before you unroll and stick.I like this product and it replaces several for me and it 's convenient . I bet you can find a great use for it as I did !	1
There have been many times when I would reach for a Post-It and think that I really only needed the sticky part ... well now they make it ! Hooray ! I tried using different writing utensils on the Post-It Adhesive Roll and it did not seem to matter which I used they all wrote on the paper wonderfully . I also have used it to put on leftover containers in the fridge and the freezer and they stuck on well for me and peeled off pretty easily . I did not have to use tape or any other type of adhesive to get it to stick and I did not need any kind of adhesive remover to take it off . I think this will be a great thing to have in the house once school is back in sessions so I can put notes on the kids folders to remind them of things ! The only thing I wish that it had was more of a serrated edge to cut the paper at ( like transparent tape ) so you got a cleaner cut .	1
This is a nice , handy little product that does just what it is intended to do . I like how you can roll out the tape to the length you want , then write a note and post it somewhere . The adhesive works fine , the dispenser works fine and it the tape surface is very pen-friendly . This is great for labeling stuff and also subbing for a regular post-it . Here 's another useful product from 3M - nothing earth shattering but something that is so very useful .	1
I 've found the lime green color eye-catching for labeling and so far has both stuck and removed cleanly on the plastic and metal surfaces I tested . If using on paper , I would test the surface first as ink can come off . I did n't have a problem on most papers but it was an issue on some.It 's convenient that it works like the post-it you know but in a roll of tape form . So this way you can choose the exact size you need ... not a too long or too little note/label.I really liked the width of this at an inch as that gives a good space to write either a few lines or one large word.Overall , I 'd recommend it as labels can be useful in the home , work , school , business , etc . There 's just so many possibilities for the same item .	1
I have some serious love for this Post-It adhesive roll - I really like that it 's so easy to tear off a piece just the size I need . I 've had no problem using the dispenser to make a clean tear - no scissors needed ... what I do is pull out some of the tape and stick it to my kitchen counter to write on the label and then I tear it from there , it seems having the tape stuck firmly to something makes it easier to tear cleanly from the dispenser.In the bathroom , I labeled my pump bottle that holds acetone and this is a bright color to grab attention . In the kitchen , I use it on the sides of storage containers in the fridge for leftovers and other food ( for instance , so family members can tell the difference between the diced jalapeno and the diced green chilies , or the difference between the shredded regular cheddar cheese and the shredded reduced fat cheddar cheese that my hubby uses - it 's not the preshredded stuff that comes in bags , I shred it myself from a block of cheese so identifying the containers is important ) .Good sturdy adhesive , it works as it should . When I run out of this labeling adhesive roll , I 'll be buying more .	1
Every where you turn someone is modifying the post-it note . They all have their place but this one is truly awesome ! Just like a roll of tape , it has the same full sticky backing . Stick it to whatever you want and write on it . I use it for my son 's sippy cup and snack bowls ; fantastically useful . For my use there 's quite a lot to spin through , and I like the color choices ( mine is in green ) . Of course price could always be cheaper - current listing is $ 3.00 , but that 's not bad . What I love most is that it sticks to anything and removes without leaving that sticky residue behind - something you do n't always get by using regular tape.NOTE : Do not get it wet . I had it on my son 's sippy cup and forgot to remove it before washing . It left that sticky residue behind that was difficult to get off .	1
****This product will most likely appeal to fans of Post-It notes -- of which I am one ! The roll of tape is like the sticky part of a regular Post-It note , so it is all sticky , with no non-sticky parts . It is even a bit stickier than a regular Post-It note , because it can be reused over and over again.The manufacturer , 3M , warns that the sticky adhesive may mark some surfaces or lift some inks , so it should not be used on anything that could be damaged by this . It is not , however , like those annoying price tags that come on so many items that you have to use adhesive-remover to get off . The adhesive is in-between that and a regular Post-It note . I noticed a problem with it on really frail onion-skin type book pages -- I have to pull very gently so it does n't rip the page . Other than having to be a little careful with it , it 's a super product.Recommended . ****	1
This is a really cool product . I love that you do n't have to waste a whole sticky when you just need a small piece . I think it would be nice if it came on a heavy dispenser , like scotch tape does too.The only issue I found is that you have to tear it off , write on it , then unstick it from whatever you were using as a writing surface . Of course if you just put it directly on the final destination , that 's not a big deal . The post its are very sticky and adhere well to most surface . Great idea !	1
I got this expecting it to be something that I would say `` wow , that 's fun - but I really do n't need to get this in my budget . '' I was wrong ! This post-it setup is amazing . It comes out like tape and rips very easily , allowing you to get as much , or as little , that you want . It sticks beautifully onto pretty much everything , and my kids loved it because I used it to tape little messages onto their snacks when they went to school . I 've used it to label some of my photography equipment and I have also used it to label my son 's soccer gear as well . I can definitely see this as an item that should be in my utility drawer at all times !	1
I like the idea of these sticky notes in a roll . It is easy to roll out the needed length of sticky for each use . The length supplied is reasonable provided the price is not too high . This product is great for emergency use , such as when I needed to be able to temporarily label items for individual students in my classroom . In the past , I had used masking tape , which sometimes is too sticky . This product provides an alternative that is removable . I 'll keep it handy for the next labeling emergency !	1
Yayy ! I no longer have to cut the sticky part off post it notes for labels , quick , and as long or short as I need ! Very happy .	1
Post-its arise from one of those fortuitous industrial accidents , like Ivory soap or Cheese Wiz , wherein a really bad glue became something else entirely . And I do appreciate that whole removable thing.The value of this tape , which is fully backed with Post-it glue , will be immediately obvious to anyone who has torn off the non-glued part of a Post-it note to make a removable label . And , it 's a lovely almost-neon green to boot ! However , for large amounts of removable labeling needs , any hardware store can supply you with easily removable blue painters ' masking tape ( not the stronger-glued white stuff ) . Which is a whole lot cheaper.So , if you only want a little , and you want it bright , get this stuff . For larger labeling tasks , maybe not .	1
I love this stuff ! ! I can think of many uses for it already . Being a person who labels boxes , etc with masking tape , this will be so much nicer ! And as a collage artist , I can think of even more ways to use this for calligraphy , journals , and mixed media art ! I would definitely buy this in all colors ! ! Great for marking places on charts , any where that a small piece of `` safe sticky '' paper is needed !	1
I seriously love this product and have used it for everything and almost everywhere . It 's ridiculous how many items I find myself using this on , it 's crazy ! I love the great bright color and the quality of it and am already ordering more !	1
I love this product ! I can stick it on wood , metal , paper , plastic - I ca n't think of any surface I have n't stuck it on . It is very handy for labeling anything and everything , even items I put in the freezer and fridge - it still sticks ! The paper is nice and thick enough and the color is bright and noticeable . I would love to see this product in many different colors .	1
I like this versatile Post-It . Great for bookmarking pages and tell-tales for signatures . Immediately after I received it I had a use for it .	1
Works great for surface labeling and can be used for tab labeling in a pinch if you fold it over on itself.For a stronger tab label simply fold it over to adhere to both sides of the page .	1
I use post it notes a lot . I have a bunch all over my computer monitor with reminders of things I need to do - otherwise I forget ! I also use the tabs , to mark book pages , and recipes I want to try . I have them in three size - I really do use them a lot . : - ) The post it roll is a 400 inch roll of post it tape and you can take as little or as much as you like . It 's sticky on the whole back side so if you just want to mark a page you can take a small piece . But if you want to mark a box , or anything else that 's larger you just take as many inches as you want . It works great and I like that can take as little or as much as you need . Recommended !	1
Of course , no one *needs* this product , and there are dozens of different ways of achieving the same goal , but this is a product of convenience & simplicity , and it has a 'finished ' look . Those are the reasons why people would buy it : it 's more convenient than cutting pieces of paper , it looks a lot better than ripped pieces of masking tape , and it 's easier to use these than pulling out a label maker ( and maybe cheaper , in the long run ) .It 's a convenience , and it 's not being advertised as anything more than what it is . For some , it may be worth the cost , but for me it 's not . However , I ca n't rate the product based on whether or not the price matches its usefulness to me alone , which is why I rated it as I did ( 3.5-4.0 ) . It 's exactly what they say it is , and it accomplishes the tasks they claim it will accomplish .	1
I 've always loved stationery stores and this product reminds me of being a kid at our local store , trying out the new pens and the colorful paper and tapes , etc.This is another great product from post it - bright green is an easy to see and can't-miss color , and this is a great way to label things temporarily without damaging them.Have teenagers ? A husband ? Young kids ? Put these labels on the papers they have to take to work or school and they wo n't leave them on the table , again . I use them myself for work , shopping , and reminders , and they 're also fun for labeling plastic red cups at parties , etc.These are NOT for permanent labels - they are designed to peel off so they 're really for short term , temp use .	1
It 's hard to say much about this product . It does what it says on the tin , as they say , and is a simple , convenient way to attach a temporary label to something . For the price I wish the roll was bigger , but that 's the only real negative . Would buy again .	1
We use Post-its for many purposes : marking papers , books , reminders on computer screens , jars of roasted coffee ( it changes every week ) - just about everything and everywhere . We have several different sizes of Post-its but there are plenty of times when you do n't have the perfect size whether too small or you have to waste a large one . This makes it much more convenient . Roll it out and tear , how much easier does it get . Never used them for black tie events so not worried how perfect they are.Excellent product !	1
I have used these to label food and am really happy with them ! I was using tape before , but it 's hard to get that off of containers once you 're done . Thise stuff sticks really well , but also comes off really easily . You can make it as short or long as you need it to be , so it 's perfect for labeling smaller portions of things you 've bought in bulk , leftovers in old yogurt containers , things in jam jars , etc . The only downside is that it does n't stick that well to anything with a texture to it , like the sides of those quilted jam jars . So I just put it on the lid . Hope this helps !	1
This is a pretty cool idea from the people at Post-It . It 's essentially just the sticky part of the post-it note that you peel off of a spool and use as a label . The adhesive is n't too strong , so it comes off clean with no residue . I do n't make a ton of labels , but when I need to , these work well . It 's not going to stick forever , but it 's good enough for anything that you would use a post-it note for . Recommended to anyone with OCD .	1
The `` Post-It '' inventor is a genius in my book and with this new `` Post-It Full Adhesive Roll , '' in my opinion , genius has been upped by a notch ! I really love this idea . `` Post-Its '' are a staple in my profession ( teaching ) but sometimes they fall off , mainly due to being jostled around in my files . I tried the sticky notes that are all adhesive ( as opposed to just the strip at the top ) and they stay put very well , but many times I have to cut them into pieces when I do n't need a whole note page . I 've also tried the `` mini '' size sticky notes , but usually the whole pad comes apart in my bag . I 've been using the `` Post-It Full Adhesvie Roll '' for two weeks and voila ! these problems are solved . I 've used the Roll to temporarily label or re-label file folders , to add a quick `` identifiers '' to important ( or duplicate ) documents and best of all , to correct students ' work without making a permanent entry on their papers . I 've found that this `` Post-It Tape '' is a perfect way to add comments/suggestions to any type of written/printed document without permanently altering the paper . The dispenser is easy to toss in a briefcase or tote bag and stay intact ! I would love to see the `` Post-It Full Adhesive Roll '' come in different colors ( especially white ) and perhaps in a multi-color pack . Until that happens , I 'm definitely going to stay a devoted user of this new green Post-It product .	1
This is a cool green post-it in a roll format with good adhesion . Love post-its and use them constantly , so I think this is a great idea . My only criticism would have been that the roll was wider . One inch wide feels a little stingy to me , and maybe because I 'm afflicted with poor eyesight .	1
Post-It seems to be able to predict what we will be needing . This label-on-a-strip is particularly useful . You can cut it any size you want and write on it as much as you need and as big as you want.I expected that it would be a little shiny and plasticized ( like the post-it tabs we place on pages ) but it is closer to the paper in post-it notes , maybe a tad thicker and less smooth . The glue is applied all over ( like on scotch tape ) and , while these things are a little hard to measure , I think the adhesive is stronger , closer in strength to the larger post-it tabs than to the glue on post-it notes . The reason I concluded this is that I had previously applied post-it notes to canisters in my pantry ( where the a/c is turned off at night ) and those started curling off and falling off after about a week , these have stayed on , edge to edge , and not even the corners are curling off ( so far ) . ( I live in South Florida where it gets pretty humid and this is the summer ) . So far , so good.It is very helpful to be able to write big enough to read from a distance and the bright color background is somehow more contrasty than just black on white background . I am using a black sharpie with the medium tip.Although , originally , labeling canisters and large plastic containers in the kitchen was the only job I had in mind when I got it . I have found myself labeling other things that are stored on high shelves ( like binders with my backup cd 's , boxes with outgrown baby clothes , boxes with sewing or craft patterns -- saves me climbing up and getting the wrong box ) . It sticks equally well to cardboard or plastic boxes . You can put quite a bit of information on each label.The only defect that I find is that the cutting mechanism needs a little more thought . Since the edge is n't perforated ( I suppose they did n't want a wavy edge ) it 's hard to get the cut started . I am cutting with scissors using the edge as a guide , but I do n't like to rip it off manually since it does n't look as neat as I 'd like.But , all in all , this is a pretty useful little product !	1
I absolutely love Post-it 's new adhesive tape . It 's 400 inches of 1-inch wide neon green , fully sticky-backed heavy stock paper . It dispenses like tape and you can pull off as much or or little as you need without any effort . I 've been using it for everything from labeling containers of leftovers so I do n't have to dig through the fridge to highlighting spines of books that I pull from the the shelf all the time -- it 's wonderful not to have to stop and study all the faded spines ; I just go for the green.I 've even labeled vegetables from the garden so I know which squash needs to be used or processed first -- and it sticks ! Yesterday , I wrote down a complicated address and stuck it to my steering wheel and did n't have to keep glancing away from the road to remember the number.While I would recommend using regular Post-It Notes for sticking to book pages or other kinds of delicate paper , I 'm using this for everything else . I did n't have a mailer for some material I was taking to the post office , so I wrote it down , stuck it to the material and wrote it on the priority envelope when I got to the PO . No digging around in my purse for the scrap of paper.The possibilities are endless , and so 's my love for this little item . It 's bright , quick , and sticks . I never want to be without a roll again !	1
I use this tape mostly for card making . I use it for masking , so I do n't get ink all over the back of my card . or masking if I do n't want to stamp a leaf stamp over a rose ( for example ) I mask the rose and then the part I do n't want just stamps on the post it note tape and then when I peal it off , presto , its lovely . its great for stamping stripes in different colors and so many other things . you can see it being used in many of the videos by Kristine warner and Jennifer McGuire on u tube . ( many others also ) this tape is also really great to use to hold dies in place as you put the cardstock and dies through your die cutting machine . it works so well . I love this stuff	1
I used this product on a drinking glass with condensation . Although the label got wet and I could slide it around , it stayed put . After it dried , I took it off and restuck it on the glass . It held without any problems and did not leave any residue . I have tried other removable labels that did not work as well and I love that I can make this the size I need . It does say the item can lift some inks and damage delicate papers but so far so good . Love it .	1
This Post-It product from 3M is designed for convenience and flexibility . The one inch width provides plenty of space for writing notes . With 400 inches of length , it is likely that over 100 notes can be made from a single roll.We tried it out on different kinds of paper over different lengths of time . With newsprint , which we thought might be particularly problematic because of its porosity , it did lift some of the ink but left sufficient to be able to still read the article clearly.Experiments with various media proved highly successful . The notes adhered well to all surfaces and came off without leaving adhesive behind . We were even able to use one to label a package of meat for the freezer and it remained attached over several days without loss of text or adhesive.Overall , we found this product to be a conveniently packaged item that performs as we would expect from a manufacturer with the reputation of 3M .	1
In short I like the quality of the scans . It also scans quickly and the set up was plug and scan . I use a different program for editing tge scans . I found the kodak software to be pretty basic . I do alot of scans for ancestry and wanted one that was portable . However this CAN be portable but i think its a bit bulky . I use this in combo with a Kodak printer and it all works well together and i get clear quality prints . I am very happy with this scanner ... .i only gave it 4 stars because i dont think it is a little bulky and heavy to be `` portable '' as it claims .	1
Great gizmo.I was born in the early part of the 1960 's , and as such I 'm now in my early 50 's . What does that have to do with a document scanner ? Not much other than I have a whole lot of boxes filled with 'important stuff ' . Stuff I feel a need to keep , but it would probably be better if I threw most of it out . Now with this ScanMate scanner I can do both.The scanner itself could n't have been easier to set up . As is typical for most things today , all I had to do is put in the CD and install the software/drivers - and then plug in the scanner when prompted . I 'm running Windows 7 Professional and the installation went without a hitch . To turn on the scanner you simply pop open the cover on it - and the cover becomes the input tray for the scanner . The controls on the scanner are simple - there is a large numeric display that shows numbers 1 to 9 . Beneath that there is a large button , which when pressed cycles the numbers on the display . The numbers represent the nine different scanning modes that the scanner will do . The different modes allow the scanner to scan to a color PDF , a B/W PDF , several image formats and also to an OCR text file . You can easily change the settings if need be . There is one other button underneath the mode button and it has a big bright illuminated arrow on it - and as you might guess it 's the start scan button.The way the scanner works is you place a stack of documents face down ( top side down ) on the scanner input tray , select the mode you want and then press the arrow button . The pages are quickly pulled through the scanner and drop out the bottom part of the front . Scanning is fairly quick , and the way the scanner is configured out of the box - it will scan both sides of the document at the same time ( you can change that setting if you do n't need to scan the back of stuff ) . Once the scanner has scanned the pages , you get a pop-up box on the computer screen . Here is where my experience might be different than other peoples ' . The scanner comes with some business card management software - which I did not install . I 've got a full installation of Adobe Acrobat Pro X on my machine and when I scan something to a PDF , that is the software that gets launched with my new PDF document . There are a number of document management software packages out there that would work with this scanner - but for my needs Acrobat works for me.So how does the scanner do - Great ! so far . One of the first things I did with it was to go to the kitchen and pull out that one drawer that I know pretty much everybody has . You know the drawer , the one with odd plastic lids that you do n't know what they fit - and under those lids all the manuals and warranties that came with every single kitchen appliance / gizmo that you have ever bought or were given as a present . First thing I did was to weed out the ones for all the gizmos that are no longer with us ( R.I.P ) . The rest , I ran them through the scanner and made PDF files out of them . Some of the manuals I had to take apart and cut the splines so as to get them to fit the 8 1/2 '' width of the scanner 's input tray . After I made the PDFs , I put the files where I could find them and even made a backup of them on one of my USB portable hard drives . Then I tossed the paper versions in the trash with the other stuff ( and threw the old plastic lids in too ) . Now I 've got a whole new drawer of space in my kitchen . It 's surprising how good that feels.My plan now is to repeat that with all the old boxes of documents I 've accumulated over time and different careers . To end - I really recommend this Kodak ScanMate to anyone wanting to get back some of the wasted space in your closets / garage / attic or even just your desk drawers.Kodak ScanMate i940 Scanner	1
I have owned or used a lot of document scanners over the years . This is clearly a solid heavy duty document scanner . Though Kodak claims it is a mobile scanner , and in a sense it is , I am not sure I would want this scanner in my carrier on.The build quality of the scanner has a very solid feel . Setup is no more than a few minutes and worked flawlessly on a Windows 7 system . I found the mechanical design on par with or better than more expensive scanners . I can only label this scanner as a hybrid between a truly portable scanner and a dedicated desktop scanner . The speed is impressive at 20ppm though I achieved 23ppm double sided . Kodak notes you can use the scanner on the road without the power source . But , you must use a second USB port for the power.I recommend not using the Kodak supplied scanning software . There are much better options available for direct scanning and document organization . But , if you elect not to spend the additional money on scanning software , the Kodak software will work for you.Note that this scanner ( for me ) worked through a USB hub though it is not recommended .	1
Great cork board , especially for the price . I really like how the black frame around the board is nice and thick . It actually looks quite nice . The cork board itself seems to be pretty good quality . One downside is that it does not come with any hardware already mounted on for hanging on a wall , although it is included separately . I have n't gone to the trouble of attaching it yet .	1
I just redid my home office . I got a bulletin board only to find out I could n't use push pins with it . It has ribbons and they are not really effective for holding papers . I love this . It 's a perfect size and you can use it horizontal or vertical . The hardware comes with it for hanging.A push pin stays in place because it 's nice thick cork . Very good product for a nice low price and it 's very useful .	1
This black-framed cork board is the size of a legal piece of paper.My tween has it in her bedroom for pictures of friends , cards , and to hang a calendar from.The frame is sturdy wood , and the cork is firmly in place.The hanging kit , included with the board , consists of two screws , three plastic wall anchors , and two metal brackets . Instructions on how to hang the board are included . The instructions are both words and pictures.This is a good item for an older child 's room , or small spaces .	1
I have attached this cork board to the inside of one of my kitchen cabinets so that I can pin up notes that I want to keep handy , but do n't want floating around the kitchen , making it cluttered . Its perfect for shopping lists , keeping track of when medicine was administered , meals list , etc . Its also an attractive little board , with a nice looking frame , so I think you could put up anywhere and be happy with its appearance .	1
What are you looking for in a cork board ? Do you just want a lot of cork ? Does it need to be decorative ? Do you want to use it in a room that has visitors or in a back office that no one but you goes into ? After you decide on that , you can decide if this one will work for you.It 's small - only 11x17 . The cork portion is about 9x15 , so if you need a lot of cork space , do n't get this one . It 's extremely attractive , which is unusual for a piece of cork board ! It has a beautiful faux wood frame that does n't show up well in the picture on this website.Bottom line : if you are looking for a small bulletin board to hang in your kitchen or other room where you have visitors , this is a nice choice . It will hold a minimal amount of photos or notes and look beautiful doing it . Check the prices on Amazon . This is a good buy for the type of board it is . If you simply want cork , look elsewhere .	1
This is a quality product . The frame is nicely constructed and it has some weight to it , unlike the flimsy corkboards you sometimes see in stores . The cork is thick and fine-grained so it holds well.The size is great -- big enough to hold several items but small enough to fit in tight spaces . It can be mounted either vertically or horizontally and the mounting hardware is included.I use mine in my home office but it would look good anywhere .	1
I mounted this board near the desk/phone area in my `` office '' and it has proven to be a very convenient placement - it helps me organize project plans and projections for the next quarter . I hung it portrait style and can easily reach it sitting at my desk or standing near the phone . One caution , tho , it is for lightweight duty only , as it is rather cheaply made , and it 's easy to punch a stick pin right thru it !	1
I wanted a petite cork bulletin board to match my new motif in my office . I panted the walls gray and have black accents . I am trying to keep the office neat and tidy this go around . This legal paper-sized board is just what I needed to post notes and scraps of papers in order to keep my desk from becoming cluttered . The mounting screws worked just fine . Overall , I am happy with this nifty product .	1
From the picture , I expected more cork board than it actually has . The black border is thicker than I thought it would be . So , I only have given it four stars.HOWEVER ... . it really looks classy , it is so easy to hang and it is small for those spaces that simply do not have a lot of room . If I had been able to hang it vertically , I would be able to post 8x11 pieces of paper . I had to hang it horizontally and it drapes over the black border.Overall , I am pleased with this product . I just wish the border were a tiny bit smaller and the cork a little more present .	1
In reality , this is a commodity product . It does not pretend to be an exceptional , life changing item and it does not do more than it implies.Positives* Attractive* Strong - easy enough to hang* Light weightLimitations* Smaller than the dimensions imply - the cork is not 11x17 but 9x15* Photo is not accurate - the frame is thicker than the photo shows and one should be aware this is is more of a rectangle and not the square look in the photo* Cost is competitive , especially if part of the Prime program when shipping is not an additional cost.Dr .

ACCO usually brings us quality office supplies worthy of display and constant utility . They sure did not let us down with this Bulletin Board . It appears to be too heavy to be supported with magnets ; however , ACCO included the necessary hangers for attaching the Board to the wall in either landscape or portrait positions . If , before hanging , you are not sure about the position , be sure to attach the hangers on the wall no more than 7 & # 34 ; apart from the center of the inside molding . That distance might save time when or if the Board has to be repositioned from landscape to portrait . The instructions suggest placing a hanger about 2 inches from the side ; however , should a time come when you had to change the orientation , it could create an unnecessary redo.Even though no pins or thumb tacks were included , I would suggest that push pins would make a better hanging device compared to others . That little inch twist of the push pin releases sufficient holding pressure to make for continuous use while reducing the chance of knocking the Board off the wall.I love to use products for other than 'intended ' purposes . In this case I do not use the Board for bulletins , but for dog picture holders and it works wonderfully . The dogs even 5 star like it .	1
We have n't unpacked this yet since my daughter will be taking it with her to college in August , but I was surprised by how nice looking the frame is . Small but not cheap looking , just the right size for one person , and will look very attractive on the wall .	1
I normally do n't like to hang things that will collect clutter , but I really do need a bulletin board more and more lately . I really liked how simple yet stylish this one was . The black frame goes with any style and matches just about anything . I realized I can make it even more attractive by covering the cork with scrapbook or other paper . It 's the perfect size for my needs.I might even get a second one . I need a board for important information , tasks , etc . But I also want another one to use as an inspiration board . I love coastal style and thought it would be great to make a board for my re-design of my master bedroom . I can use it to display inspirational photos , paint chips , fabric samples , and more . It 's the perfect size . Those are just 2 uses . I can think of many more.So far , while lightweight , it seems pretty solid and is holding up well for my use . I like the fact that it is lightweight so it does stay where you hang it . You can hang it either vertically or horizontally.As other reviewers have already noted , make sure you are aware that the dimensions include the frame , so you do n't get the full 11 & # 34 ; x 17 & # 34 ; of cork space . Some people have been dissatisfied with the depth of the cork . I have not had a problem since it works for my needs but if you are looking for something really thick than you might not be happy with this depth . And yes , the frame is wider than it appears in the photo.If you are looking for a compact , lightweight , stylish bulletin board then you will be quite happy with this purchase . If you need something larger , heavier , and with a deeper cork padding , then you might want to find another option.Overall , I am satisfied with the style , quality , ease of use , and the way it meets my varied needs . It has so many potential uses . I happen to like that it does n't take up a lot of space and I think the wide framing makes it look stylish . So I would definitely recommend this product .	1
This cork board measures 11x17 inches which you probably see in the description so for perspective , it 's the size of a legal sheet of paper . Not large at all , but if you want to pin smaller items like business cards , photos , etc ... you are in good shape.I love the fact this board has the black frame . It makes it look a lot nicer in my opinion and if you are using this at an office or just want a more polished look to your bulletin board , this is a nice touch.Other than that , it 's a basic bulletin board , You can use push pins or if you have photos or business or appointment card , they will slide right in the corners under the frame and stay put .	1
I found this to be a very nice bulletin board . The frame is well made , perhaps wider than I had anticipated , but nice nonetheless . The corked area is a bit smaller than expected , but the item is well made and useful . Plenty of cork space for what I needed , and the black frame is a great finishing touch .	1
Surprised at how small the cork area is , 13 3/4 x 7 3/4 inches . The black frame is quite large but does give the cork board a finished look . It feels sturdy but not too heavy . I can see using this in a more decorative function , like displaying postcards or special notes . If you 're artistic , you could dress up the frame by painting on flowers , geometric designs etc . and make it fit your color scheme .	1
We have an active family , and putting notes or the various slips of papers including doctors notes and bills to pay is an essential activity . So having a great solid well build cork board is a must in my house . This fit the bill perfectly.The frame is really nice and can go well on the wall or a door . It looks fantastic and goes well just about anywhere.Hard to miss with this one .	1
The black frame on this adds a surprising elegance ( much more so than I expected ) . It is also exceptionally light weight . I placed it on my office door ( below my name badge ) -- it looks wonderful there	1
I am actually sitting here looking at this board as I write this . It is hanging up next to my desk . I really like the quality but I was a little disappointed in the size . I guess I did n't read the dimensions before I ordered . However , it is working out well for me and I do like it . When I think of a cork board , I envision something larger , so keep in mind that this has a small footprint .	1
If you 're trying to stay organized , there are a lot of ways to do that -- written lists are mine . Previously , I had a much bigger white board for names of clients and tasks , but it ended up hidden behind an office chair . This is a much smaller , less unwieldy solution to taking notes . I would n't hang it up , though -- mine is stacked on the side of a file box , where I can take it down and handle it . It also works as a little cork lap desk , because of the size and construction .	1
A great bulletin board for use in small spaces ! The 11 by 17 ( ledger size ) cork board is great for small spaces , small areas that you want to install a little board ; personally I love the size for small notes and reminders ... the board seems very sturdy and worth the price : perfect for use in tight places !	1
I love this cork bulletin board . The frame around it is beautiful & very classy looking . Could be put in any room.The only thing I did n't like about it ? I do n't like the hooks that it comes with to hang it . It has the kind you have to screw in the wall - I do n't care for having to pull out a drill . I understand its probably necessary if you hang a lot on the board . I ended up just getting one of those plate holder kind of things & using it on my desk that way .	1
The bulletin board is sturdy , has a sturdy frame and thick cork . That said , it is 11x17 to the outside of the frame . I would say it is a bit misleading as I , and I 'm sure others , thought the usable cork surace would be 11x17.The frame is nicely painted and has no blemishes . The mounting hardware is a bit flimsy , but use my own anyway so it is n't a negative for me , but may be for others.All in all I would say it is worth the price if you need a good quality cork board of this size .	1
This is a very tasteful cork board . Other reviewers have objected to the thick frame , but I think the wooden frame is the best part of this board . It looks nice enough to hang in a main part of the house . I am going to hang it in the hallway . If you want a big catch-all cork board , this is not for you . I will use it for tickets , announcements , photos and the like . I tested a large push pin on the board and it did not penetrate the backing . This was a complaint by another reviewer . I did not give 5 stars because the wall hanging kit seemed overkill for such a small item . Why would you need to drill a hole and place a wall anchor for such a light piece ? I concur with the other reviewer who just used a nail . If you have a small niche on a wall , and like arranging memorabilia artistically , this is the cork board for you .	1
I really like this Bulletin Board . It is well made and sturdy . The cork is nice and thick and holds stick pins well.It is handy to use for reminders , notes , cards and art work . You can show off your children 's work from school and more . I also like the size . I think it is just the right size for small rooms and apartments .	1
I think that the Quartet Cork Bulletin Board is very good quality . It is sturdy and well constructed . It works as advertised and the black border gives it a more classy and modern look . I would have no problems with it , but the size is n't as stated . The frame takes up a lot of the size , so the actual cork area is much smaller than 11 X 17 inches .	1
The Quartet Cork Board is quite a classy looking board . With a wide 1-1/2 & # 34 ; frame , it says & # 34 ; notice me & # 34 ; ! The cork area is only 8 & # 34 ; x 13-1/2 & # 34 ; which is a little larger than a piece of computer paper ( possibly legal paper sized ) , so this is n't going to hold many notes/pictures . This would be more for a personal space , by a phone or in a kitchen where notes usually stay small and are cycled through a lot . I have a small area by my desk where I have it hung vertically and it looks very nice there.The frame 's corners are well matched with no gaps and has an even finish . The cork is average with a corrugated cardboard back that the tacks go into . The hangers that come with the board are interesting and if placed well , will allow the board to be turned from vertical to horizontal without having to move the hangers . Also included are screws and drywall anchors - everything you need except for the screwdriver/drill . The directions on how to hang the board were clear and concise . If you do use the drywall anchors , the directions states what size hole to make to put the anchors in . It seems like it would be too small , but it works perfectly ! Would I recommend this to family and friends ? Yes , but only for small/personal spaces .	1
Quartet makes bulletin & white boards of fairly good quality and this smaller version is no different , I was just disappointed by how small it actually was - the total measurement is 11x17 , not your actual work-space . So that super thick black frame eats up room you could be using to pin things on this small bulletin board .	1
I needed a standard desk stapler and was offered this one to review.The top casing is plastic but seems pretty sturdy . Works like you 'd expect a Swingline stapler to work . No fuss , consistent staples even through 10 sheets of paper.So far it is working great . If I have any issues I will update this review .	1
Everyone in my office knows I have a penchant for collecting fun office supplies . This cute little blue/white stapler fits right in on my desk ! It is small ( smaller than a regular stapler ) and very easy to use . It staples well - without jams or misfires to date . It can not do the HUGE jobs but the office has a bigger automated punch type stapler for that . I have to say I really like how light it is and how well it fits in my hand . I like to hold and staple rather than contort and staple which happens sometimes with regular staplers . In the scheme of all things stapler the point is to get your papers together and in one bunch - and this does all that and looks sharp and unique !	1
Swingline makes the greatest staplers on earth . We are only now replacing a stapler of the same size by the same maker at least five decades old , and passed down by our grandparents . This one works beautifully , and we hope will last just as long as the original .	1
I am changing the furniture in my office and when I saw this stapler , I knew I had to have it . It 's a little smaller than a regular size stapler , but it does take standard size staples . It works quite well and it looks great sitting on my desk .	1
The stapler is your basic plastic stapler but it has a unique design . I like the aqua blue leaf pattern . It adds a little something to my desk . When a co-worker wants to `` borrow '' my stapler-it will be easy to find where it landed . The stapler was easy to load and works great !	1
I have lots of staplers , but I tend to be a light user of them and actually prefer the mini version to a big bulky one in my desk . My kids also use it frequently , so the mini size has always been my preference . But now , I think this is my new & # 34 ; go to & # 34 ; stapler . My favorite feature is how easy it is to load new staples and NOT snap my finger off in the process . I sort of clicks open in a way , and does n't threaten to close on me before I want it to . And it fits in my hand well .	1
Really , what can you say about a stapler ? It 's a stapler.The things that matter here are basic construction , which is good but not amazing , and the ability to feed staples with no problem , which it does.I 've used it on multiple sheets of paper multiple times and have had no feed issues or ruined staples . It just works.Plus , it 's got a nice retro look that my kids love.If you 're looking for a major workhorse stapler , I 'd look elsewhere - this is n't built like a tank . But it 's certainly built well enough to work as the occasional-use stapler that most people require .	1
I love my new stapler . The design looks great on my desk , and the stapler is lightweight which I enjoy . I am always loosing staplers off of my desk ; they just walk away . Everyone else in the office has a black stapler , so now if my stapler `` disappears '' , I am sure it will be easy to find ! I found that it would only staple 12 printer paper sheets together . Not sure what kind of paper would be needed to staple 20 sheets.Overall a great stapler for day to day use .	1
No longer will I have to go cubicle to cubicle trying to figure out who `` borrowed '' ( without returning ) my stapler ! No more ! With its fashionable blue leaf pattern , it will be visually obvious as I search the office to find out who stole my stapler . No more sneaking into cubicles and checking the bottom of the stapler for the label with my name on it . Now , it will be obvious . You wo n't be able to get away with stealing my stapler ! No more begging the office supply manager for yet another stapler.This Swingline is plastic , not metal , and is lighter than one would expect . It does a good job of stapling , I had no problem taking it through the 20 sheets as advertised . The only time I 've run into problems with the stapler sticking or not stapling through was when the number of staples started to run low . When you get down to less than 5 or so staples , the integrity of the stapler starts to fail . This seems to be the case with most staplers that I have used.One final thing that may be worth noting is the stapler does not open up all of the way . ( It opens to just slightly over 90 degrees . This means that you wo n't be able to easily use this stapler to staple directly to your cubicle wall or to a bulletin board . If this is n't a feature you require , this is a great stapler for the price , and pretty as a bonus !	1
A cute little stapler , that fits in your hand . This little guy is light weight and works well . I took it to work , to see if it could stand up to the job . So far , it has stapled accurately and efficiently . It will staple 20 sheets of paper , easily , without jamming or distorting the staple . I counted out exactly 20 sheets of printer paper and tried it . It does n't come with staples , and it wo n't fit an entire batch of staples . I had to break one batch in half to fill it . Swingline is a good brand , and all of our heavier staplers at work are Swingline staplers . I would recommend this stapler , if you are looking for one that works , and works well .	1
This small stapler beats the old fashioned looking staplers with it 's colorful pattern and small size . For a jazzy stapler to dress up your desk , this one is perfect . It 's a smaller size and does n't take a complete , standard row of staplers , but almost . I 've had no problem with bent staples or jamming for stapling normal size bundles of papers . The design is very pretty and bright and is a nice change from the normal , common gray staplers . It 's also got cute square design and looks cute on the desk.This stapler is a nice quality and is n't flimsy or delicate , it 's sturdy and works very well and is pretty durable . Swingline is a great company that turns out quality items and this stapler fits the bill .	1
If you are looking for fashion more than function , this might be the stapler for you . There are plenty of staplers that do a better job of stapling . By that I mean , the mechanism is takes less effort to use and handles bigger jobs . However , if you want a matching set of desk tools in green or red or blue , this stapler works fine . I tested it on 20 sheets of paper and it has no trouble . The staple went in smooth and fastened properly . Staples load easy . For the price , it does the job .	1
The Swingline Fashion Stapler looks cheap . It 's all straight lines and bargain bin-looking plastic , and the rubber feet on the bottom are narrow little strips that just look ineffectual . Aesthetically speaking , it 's not much , except for its color -- though this shade of green just seems wrong to me as a stapler color.That said , I 've now tested the Swingline against my trusty Red Stapler , and its performance has surprised me . My Red Stapler has formerly contended with and handily beaten the PaperPro StandOut Standup Stapler ( see my review : http : //www.amazon.com/review/RU4RHFHA1DBRD/ ) . But I 'm afraid that it 's now met its match ( with an important caveat -- see below ) . The Swingline has a solid feel to it , and it 's easy to use one-handed . It turns out that it can also handle a lot of paper at one time . I tested both staplers by having them staple multiple sheets of paper together . At 27 sheets the Swingline is still going strong , and I can still use it easily with one hand . But my Red Stapler falters at this stage : it can still staple effectively if I use two hands , or if I use it against a desk , but one handed stapling simply does n't work . The Swingline definitely wins the day here.The important caveat alluded to above may turn out to be a big problem.The hinge of the stapler , where it opens and closes , has a metal rod going through it . It 's a plus that it 's not plastic : the hinges of some mini staplers are made of plastic , and they inevitably break there . But the problem is that while the rod has a head on one end that keeps it in place , there is nothing keeping the rod in place on the other end . ( By contrast , my Red Stapler is constructed in such a way that the rod in its hinge could not come loose . ) Twice already the rod has started to work its way loose . It 's something that I 'll have to keep an eye on for the life of this stapler . Yet another sign of cheap construction , but in this case one that has more than aesthetic ramifications.So , the Swingline gets 5 stars on performance , and perhaps 3 on appearance . Marks off also for the metal rod problem . I 'm still giving it 4 stars , however , since performance , I think , trumps the other two considerations .	1
I do n't use a stapler terribly often . This means that I sort of depend on the thing coming with a starter amount of staples . That usually lasts me around a year , and I never even think about it . After my last stapler broke ( do n't ask ) , I figured I 'd get another one . What do you know ? It 's a cute little stapler , much more compact than it seems in the picture , and lightweight enough to toss in your backpack and forget about.I 'm docking a point , because there were no starter staples , so I had to go to the store and get a pack before I could use the thing . Otherwise , I 'm happy . The stapling action is smooth , and the staples do n't bunch up annoyingly . It 's a solid stapler by a solid brand . Bear in mind that this is not a heavy stapler . It is rather on the light side . If you do n't like a light stapler , this is not for you .	1
Swingline fashion is an inexpensive type of stapler that will liven up any work space . It is sold in variety of colors for you to choose from . Performance-wise , it is certainly not the best ever , as something you have to apply extra pressure for heavier jobs . There are many other staplers out there where less force is needed . I 'm not sure how long it will last , but I estimate if you use it sparingly and do n't abuse it , it will last you a longer time .	1
This stapler is on the small end of the spectrum and takes up less real estate on my desk that most . The blue leaf design is attractive and adds a little flair to a device that is normally utilitarian in design . When I first looked it over I assumed based on its size and looks that it would probably sacrifice a bit in the performance department , but I was wrong . Have tested this out on and it has worked error-free on multiple sheet jobs . To test it I also staple a half dozen envelopes together which was no problem . It has a satisfyingly solid motion and punch and I 'm really happy with it . If you want a stapler that works well but has some style , this is a great choice .	1
First impressions ... It 's VERY lightweight . The construction is all plastic , and feels a bit 'cheap ' . There 's almost nothing to it . It does look attractive and the colors are bright and showy in person , but my major knock on it is that it does not accept a 'full ' clip of staples . It only takes about 70 % of the average row of staples , so you have to snap off what does n't fit to save for later . Seems like just a small redesign and it would accept the full magazine of staples without issue . It 's pretty much the same physical size as a typical stapler , so it 's not much of a sacrifice for space.Gets the job done , but is built more for a dorm room desk than for day-to-day use.EDITAfter using this stapler in a communal office in a warehouse with 190 employees , it still looks brand new ! I 'm adding a star because it 's obviously much more durable than I anticipated . Looks were deceiving with this one .	1
If you had one of the smaller Swingline staplers that looked like this one in the past you probably remember that they were a very sturdy , solid chunk of metal.This stapler is not that.It has metal in it but most of it is plastic and I admit to being disappointed when I first hefted it . But , after using it for a while to staple some multi-page handouts I can say that it does the trick . It does not open up all the way so that it can be used to staple papers to bulletin boards .	1
I 'm really glad I got this stapler . It 's attractive , very light weight , easy to use . Smaller than the large metal ones ( this one is durable plastic ) but not as small as the mini staplers . Useful and does the job well .	1
i thought this stapler would be good to keep at the office - someone is always walking away with mine , and i figured no one could mistake this blue and white patterned stapler for their own . the stapler is not as hefty as i thought it would be , it 's more of a portable half-size stapler rather than a desktop stapler . however , it staples up to 20 pages comfortably and struggles with 30 or more pages . since i do n't need to staple packets thicker than that , it 's a good buy for me .	1
I am a Swingline fan from way back . Their staplers are the best , most dependable , longest lasting sort . I am only rating this one a little lower because it is chiefly plastic and does not have the durability of their metal ones . I do n't feel the strength in stapling that I do with their higher quality line . Still , it is a good stapler for what it is.This is a lightweight alternative to their high quality metal staplers . It 's cute and different . You will definitely be the fashionable one in the office with this sitting on your desk . It is a tad smaller too for cubicals that do n't have much space - but still takes normal staples . I probably would n't buy this same stapler again because of the reasons listed above , but I do believe in Swingline products .	1
What a cute stapler ! Seriously , that was the first thought that came to mind when I originally laid eyes on this very portable , very stylish stapler . Here 's a few facts . This uses regular size staples , but only holds half the amount of a traditional stapler . It is plastic , not metal . The stapler itself will not arrive with staples , so have those ready ! Pros : - Cute ! This is much more eye pleasing than the usual black staplers people use ! - Portable ! This thing is pretty light since it 's made of plastic , not metal.- It staples just fine ! - The staple holder is pretty easy to lift up and down . You do n't need to worry about losing a finger when adjusting the amount of staples ! Cons : - Do n't plan on doing any sort of bulletin boards or flat projects with this . It does not open all the way like your usual stapler . It only opens enough to staple papers together.Overall , I ca n't complain ! It 's a stylish stapler that does what I need it to do !	1
I first started paying attention to staplers because of Melvin 's love for his red Swingline in the movie Office Space . It seems like an odd thing to notice , but after seeing the movie I paid attention and discovered that the Swingline staplers really do jam less often and result in fewer incomplete staplings with large stacks of paper . But yeah , the staplers do look an awful lot like old time office equipment . So I opted for this to see if it was possible to get a cute stapler that was also a workhorse.The Swingline fashion stapler is n't as solid as mySwingline Standard Strip Eco Desk Stapler , 15 Sheet Capacity , Black ( S7054501E ) , but it feels sturdier than , for example , theStanley Bostitch AntiJam Full Strip Stapler , 20 Sheet Capacity ( B660-BLACK ) . It 's certainly not like other more colorful staplers I 've had that seemed made to fall apart . It handles ten sheets without any effort , and when you hold it in your hand to staple , you do n't get that slight slide to side movement that comes with cheap staplers . Bottom line , if you are putting together a lot of information packets or doing other repetitive stapling jobs , you 'll still want a good , heavy duty stapler . But if you are looking for a way to brighten your desk but do n't want to sit there trying to unjam your stapler all the time , this is a nice find .	1
This is a very functional stapler that works well and is easy to operate . The spring loaded staple holder is made of plastic and so are the outer components . This makes the stapler very light , but the rubber grips at the bottom make it stay put on the table during stapling . The light weight also makes it possible to use it in your hands . However , the plastic components do feel a bit cheap and durability might be a question ( Need to check after longer use ) . I also wish it came with some staples .	1
Everyone needs a stapler for paperwork and Swingline has always made one of the best.I think they have been in business for many years.There staplers are the most popular on the market and this one is a very nice one.I lost mine during a move and needed a new one.When it arrieved i put some staples in it and tried it right away.Of course it worked just fine just like they always do.I am very happy with it and it will get a lot of use.Great stapler '' '' I would buy another if i lost this one to .	1
This stapler is a nice size for smaller hands , yet large enough for a man to handle.The action is smooth and works nicely.It doesnt have the classic Swingline & # 34 ; feel & # 34 ; that the full sized staplers have , and did not come with any staples , but it gets the job done .	1
As a teacher , I go through about two staplers a year . They disappear from my desk and never return , or a teenager slams the top down so hard that it ends up getting stuck and no longer staples . It seems that every teacher I know ends up having a favorite stapler that they have to hide so the student 's do n't take it . This stapler is so cute , I almost wanted to do that . Unfortunately , the first day that I brought it into the classroom , I had a student see me using it . From that point on , everyone wanted to use the cute stapler.Some things you may want to know:1 . This is lightweight . This is good/bad . It is good because passing it around the room is simple . It is bad because it is going to break easier than the metal Swinglines.2 . It has no staples that come with it . You must purchase staples separately.3 . All of the designs are white with the leaf pattern in a different color . The white gets dirty FAST ! This is almost a good thing because it makes you consciously remember that everyone touches the stapler and you should clean it , but a bad thing because it 's never going to be the pretty brand new white as when you first get it.All together , my students love it and it has lasted over a week in my classroom without sneaking off ( probably because people ask for it constantly ) . With the heavy work load of a high school classroom , it is standing up pretty well . It 's not a one finger press stapler , but I do n't have any direct complaints .	1
This is a great stapler , by great I mean it 's a swingline which is a name brand in staplers , it appears to be built well and it staples papers without any issues.In my past I had staplers that would nearly take off your finger while shutting the lid after loading staples . For this one the spring inside has a lot of tension on it , but it does n't snap shut like most staplers I 've used in the past.I like it , for $ 6.50 or so it 's a definite buy if you like the pattern .	1
we 've all had the big , bulky staplers that break in less time than the staples loaded into them.The swingline model featured here does n't appear to be one of them . Very compact and friendly to the hand , this sleek stapler took the place of 2 other brands that were secured with rubber bands in my home office.Plus the `` non-black '' pattern makes it look attractive on the desk .	1
This small staple from Swingline is certainly not what you want to buy to outfit your high-end office or desk . However , there are plenty of people who are constantly losing their staplers , having them & # 34 ; walk away & # 34 ; in a dorm room setting , or who need a bunch of them for a charity event or large office setting . If cost is a big driver and you want something that will work but not break the bank , this stapler is a fine option.The stapler is actually quite cute - it is light green plastic on white plastic . It does not open 180 degrees for stapling into a wall , so it is strictly for stapling paper together . Oddly enough , the top does n't even & # 34 ; snap & # 34 ; onto the staple tray - it just kind of sits there . So you flip open the top , load in standard staples , and just flip the top closed . I was able to staple over 10 sheets of thick stock paper , so I 'm pretty happy that for light duty use , it is sufficient.For a few more dollars , Swingline definitely has better options . But if need something inexpensive that works , this stapler is a fine choice .	1
This is a very nice small Swingline stapler . It 's a pretty cute design . It 's all square , no curves . It 's got an all plastic shell so it 's very light . This one is mainly green with some white trim , but it also comes in different colors and some with a leaf design . Functionally , it works well and does n't jam . At the current price and discount , a great deal.Edit : I just took a look at the other reviews . Yes , this is a small stapler and more of a light duty stapler vs. an office or professional one . I 'd mostly just do light stapling with it . If you plan to staple more than 3-4 pages routinely , then I 'd definitely get a heavy duty one .	1
I have had the stapler for about a month now . It is very easy to use . It takes standard staples . And it 's easy to open and add more staples . I have not yet experienced any jamming as others have noted . It staples several pages neatly and easily.It 's really just a cheaper Swingline Stapler available in cool , fun colors . I was n't expecting anything fancy after looking at the price , so I 'm not disappointed in what I got . It is made of plastic , which I knew , so I could see how heavy use with lots of bumping and banging around and even dropping could cause it to crack . It is very lightweight and yes , not the best quality stapler but I was n't expecting that for such a cheap price . I do n't use a stapler every day , so I wanted an extra one to keep around so I did n't have to go all the way upstairs to staple something . So for this use , it works great for me.It 's kind of contradictory because I would say this is great for kids who are old enough to use a stapler because of the fun colors . And the price is low enough that if it should break you would n't be out a lot of money . And it 's not heavy so you do n't have to worry about your kids dropping it on their toes . However , in the same sense , children are more likely to handle it roughly and it is made of cheap plastic so while I ca n't say it will break easily ( because I have not had that experience and do n't have kids who use it ) , it does seem like it would break if dropped a few times or used too roughly . It is not a high-quality stapler.If you are looking for a basic , no-frills , inexpensive stapler just to keep around the house , then this is perfect for you . If you do a lot of heavy stapling , I would probably recommend something stronger and more durable . I gave it 4 stars because I feel it does what it says it will do and for me , it 's done it well . I do think it could have been made a little better and that 's why I only gave it 4 stars.If I do experience any issues , I will update my review .	1
It looks great on my desk , very attractive and well built Stapler.I had a few staples in my old Swingline that I could take to test out my new stapler and I like it ! I just ordered a box of staples so I 'll be ready to staple away with this nice new Swingline , very nice ! ! ! ! ! ! Very well built and solid feeling as I use it .	1
My daughter grabbed this as soon as I got it out of the package . Mine , she said , and it was hers for the new school year as soon as dad got a few tries with it . I had to put it to the test and it 's perfect for school and small jobs . Uses regular Swingline staples . Holds nice in the hand and staples easy . What more can a stapler do .	1
Works great and I have had no issues with it at all . Ca n't handle big number of pages at one time , but I rarely have need for that kind of stapling . I am happy with the product .	1
The Swingline Fashion Stapler makes a statement on your desk and looks much better than the standard black business stapler . However , the build quality was not up to my expectations , especially for a good Swingline product . While the stapler is small and light , it is somewhat flimsy.Overall , it performs well . I was not faced with many staple jams and it seemed to handle a fairly thick amount of paper . It is for somewhat light duty use though , as the spacing does n't not allow for staples to be placed much beyond the corners . Overall , it 's unique stapler , but nothing is a substitute for quality .	1
OK , this is cute beyond words , and my daughter is going to love it . In fact , if you have a daughter/sister/roommate , you 'd better order more than one because they 're probably going to steal it.With that in mind , would it have killed Swingline to include a few staples ? Presumably , if you do n't have a stapler , you do n't have a box of staples hanging around either . Make sure you order some.Bottom line : It works well , it seems sturdy , and it 's cute as a button . The price is good , too . But please , sir , next time include some staples ! ! !	1
What 's different between this and most other staplers of this class , its simple , it has a youthful look . This bright breezy looking stapler is fine for everyday student work . It is light weight but well constructed . This is not intended for heavy duty daily business work but for that occasional use by a student .	1
As a teacher , I 've gone through a few staplers in my life . While I love the durability of my all metal swinglines for my class , sometimes you just do n't want to haul around a 2 pound stapler . This one is great for day to day activities and is much more portable than the others I own . To top it off , it is super cute . I love the design and color choices and it makes it easy to find on a desk full of papers . I did find it interesting that it did n't come with a few staples to get started as every other stapler I 've ever bought does . Super cute , durable , and portable ... what more do you need ?	1
This is a fantastic stapler . I 've been using a mini 2 & # 34 ; stapler for my home business , partly because it was cute and partly because it was dead cheap . I had no idea what a difference going up in size would make ! With the mini , I struggled to staple a stack of pages , it always took a lot of effort . With this stapler , it was effortless ! I was really shocked at the difference . And it 's not a huge stapler , either.The downside , for me , is the stapler 's appearance . It claims to be modern , but it looks & # 34 ; retro-cheap & # 34 ; to me , which is okay -- -except it 's also very , very green . In the description photo , it looks like a pale lime green , very subdued , which happens to match my office decor . In person , it 's a glow-in-the-dark neon green . We are talking BRIGHT ! It reminds me of something I might have owned back in the 1980s ! I will subtract a star for the fact that I hate the color . And I was disappointed that it did n't come with any staples . Fortunately , my mini stapler uses full-size staples , so I was able to load and test it right away . The staples went in easily , and stapling with it was absurdly easy ! I 'm already in love , I just wish the color was n't quite so bright.Four stars , definitely recommended .	1
This is a great stapler for my work desk . I share a cubicle in a large corporate office , so there are some things that are left on my desk all the time - pictures of loved ones , job aids , memos , and my coffee cup - and things that are locked up tight when I leave - my cute stapler , favorite pens , and spare change.Staplers are not too exciting , but this breaks away from typical office black or beige , but is n't over-the-top feminine . People compliment sometimes , but really serves to brighten up my desk a bit . Light weight and easy to staple . Has n't jammed on me yet , and easy to refill .	1
This stapler is best for light-duty use . I have one of the older , heavy metal desk staplers , and this one is mostly plastic , thus much lighter . The down side is that it does n't seem like it would hold up to very frequent use or stapling multiple papers ; if the plastic around the hinge breaks , that 's that . But it 's low priced and suitable for a grade-schooler 's desk or kitchen cubby . Staples are easily replaced by pulling up the top . There are thin rubber strips on the underside so it does n't slide around the desk .	1
This stapler is nice and compact . It 's about as long as my hand ( and I have pretty small hands ) . It 's a regular full-size stapler , though , using standard staples . It staples easily and firmly . I have n't had any difficulty with staples jamming , and the staples do n't wobble around loose after you apply them - they 're quite & # 34 ; tight. & # 34 ; It 's a good stapler and I would buy it again .	1
Swingline is known for their awesome staplers , and this one 's no different . The pretty design aside , this is a solid , easy-working stapler that does the job well . No-nonsense , straightforward functioning makes it a decent addition to your office collection . The nice design is n't garish , but makes it less bland than the average red stapler.Recommended if you need a stapler . Just do n't let anyone borrow it .	1
This stapeler is so pretty . I have used it and it works great , does not get jammed . That is a pet peeve I have with stapelers . I love the color and design . Very pretty office supply . My husband wo n't run off with it either because he thinks it is too femenine to use . We both have offices at home , but he works out and I find it best if I get pretty office supplies so he wo n't make off with them . This fills the bill . You will be happy with this purchase !	1
What can you say ? This is a stapler , and it works as intended . The idea of a `` designer '' stapler , with a leaf pattern , falls a little flat , especially as the stapler itself is not really all that well made and does n't look like it 's going to stand up under heavy use . Still , it will staple a goodly-sized sheaf of papers , and that 's really why you buy a stapler in the first place.It 's a `` hand held '' unit , not a sturdy desk stapler . It comes without staples , so you 'll have to buy those separately and right away . The packaging gives only the barest indication of staple size ; it would have been helpful to have had a suggested product number for refills ( or in this case , fills ) .If you want a light duty , light weight stapler , this product fills the bill . Just forget about the `` designer '' aspect , which really does n't add any value .	1
Swingline staplers are nearly iconic due to their inclusion in the cult hit , & # 34 ; Office Space. & # 34 ; Of course , they also are of extremely high quality , especially for their price . I now buy only Swingline staplers because I know that they will work . As an academic , I use my stapler all day , in particular to staple long articles . I get tired of other staplers jamming or being unable to handle more than a few pages at a time . I rarely have these issues with Swingline products.This model is smaller than most Swingline staplers - just under 5 inches long - and the casing is made of plastic . I was somewhat worried that it would not be able to handle larger jobs , such as a typical journal article . Fortunately , like other Swinglines , it does fine with 10+ pages . Although I think it would be fine for most people 's offices , it would be perfect for teens and older children . The colorful casing is likely to appeal to them as well . As usual , this stapler is another quality Swingline product .	1
I 've used Swingline staplers for many years , and they have worked well for me.This one has a nice decorative color ( nice if you are into that sort of thing ! ) .Other reviewers have reported that it jams a lot , but I have not had that problem with it.It only holds 1/2 the usual length of staples ( called a & # 34 ; sheet & # 34 ; ) , so you will have to reload it more often than a regular sized stapler . For someone who uses a lot of staples , that could be annoying.If you plan on using a stapler a lot , I would recommend you go with a larger , more expensive stapler . But I 'm letting my granddaughter use this one , and she has had no complaints .	1
There & # 8217 ; s not a lot to say about a stapler & # 8211 ; it works or it doesn & # 8217 ; t. This Swingline Fashion stapler works perfectly for me . It staples several sheets cleanly and without much effort . Also , the plastic is kind of soft or squishy which makes it more comfortable to hold than the staplers I & # 8217 ; m used to . It & # 8217 ; s shorter and lighter than the usual heavy duty staplers too . It takes standard staples and the green is a nice , soothing color . It says it has a one year warranty , but I haven & # 8217 ; t had any problems so far .	1
This is a cool little `` stylish '' stapler . It 's very light and even though it 's almost completely made of plastic it does n't feel especially flimsy . For occasional stapling this is a great option because it looks a lot nicer than a plain stapler , but for especially thick packets or frequent stapling at work I 'd opt for something a little more sturdy ( I 'd guess that if you drop this stapler parts of it might break ) . But I have n't run into any problems with this stapler over the last month that I 've been using it . Just because it 's compact and well-designed does n't mean it does n't get the job done !	1
This was a replacement printer so I decided to select an all-in-one this time instead of a printer only . The price was acceptable and the features on this model seemed to offer some additional options , especially since we have a Smartphone which could then use the printer to print directly from the phone.For the first time I set up a printer that was only connected by a wireless connection and must admit I had a few concerns about reliability . So far those concerns have been unfounded and the printer has worked flawlessly every time since it was set up . It has also produced some excellent color prints using the HP eprint app on the iPhone which was available free.I decided to use the on-line set-up offered as an alternative to the CD and found it to do the job smoothly and simply . I 've noticed some reviews that complained about set-up and although it was slightly more involved as I was using the wireless option I really have no complaints . I had to provide the network name and the password for the network but that is normal operating procedure.One of the nice features of this machine when set up wirelessly is the automatic update feature . Once it was operational it notified me an update was available , downloaded and installed the update with absolutely no problem . At this point I really like this machine.Since it is also a fax , the usual information required for faxes was required but that took only a little extra time to set that up . The default setting for the fax feature is auto-answer and since our phone and fax share a common line I had to disable that feature which means if I want to send or receive a fax it must be done manually.The HP 7520 looks like a formidable piece of equipment and actually looks good in place . The specs point out the duplex capability of this machine as well as the document feeder feature . All told it seems to fit the bill for our situation . As time progresses I 'll update this review if anything noteworthy happens either good or bad .	1
The features on the printer are amazing , especially for the price . And , it was rated # 1 by Consumer Reports when they last tested `` All-in-One '' printers . I have only used it to print a few documents and just copy one ... .but , it was easy and the results were excellent . The color pictures are really nice and switching to `` just print or copy in black only '' is easy and efficient . I have not faxed or scanned anything yet.For me , setting it up at first was confusing because I know nothing about wireless , etc.. So , I used the USB cord from my old printer to connect directly to my PC . I had to go to their support website and use their Installation Wizard to download the software to make it work with the USB cable . That was rather painless and it worked the first time.The instructions and `` HELP '' section that come with the download are very good , and it has nice visual illustrations for doing every task.I have a lot more to learn , at this point , this appears to be an excellent purchase .	1
This product will suffice if you are not very demanding with your products . However , if you are printing out photos for a business , I suggest you go with something else . This one is just not up to scratch for the more demanding projects .	1
It 's a replacement for my previous photosmart 7280 . Works well in copying and printing . Feeder works well Reasonably fast . Occasionally slow in starting up .	1
Printer set itself up and connected to wi-fi with hardly any effort from me . Ca n't beat the great resolution for the price.But , the thing I like most is their great support . When I set it up , there was a problem with the ink cartridge cover . I received a return email within minutes . When they saw what the problem was , they had a new ink cartridge cover to me within a day . Now everything works just great ! Would definitely recommend .	1
There are input/output devices ( scanners and inkjet printers ) which offer higher resolution , but aside from that , this is a GREAT deal for all the functionality that it provides.The setup , although not foolproof , was straightforward . It might be a tiny challenge for the non-technical , but no problem for most anyone else . I did n't like that the ink cartridges were a little tricky to install . They went in , but not with the level of ease that I was expecting . Also , there is a plastic piece on the side of the ink carriage that is difficult to avoid touching and comes off very easily . It popped right off when I touched it . Fortunately , I put it back on and have had no problems since.I have to admit that wireless printers give me a big kick . I love to be able to place them anywhere in my home with nothing but the power cable connected to them . The wireless works flawlessly.Finally , I tried printing a photo . It came out quickly but it was horrible ! I was going to give the printer four stars because it does just fine in all other areas . But then I thought that maybe it was the software ( ACDSee Pro 5 ) that was to blame for the photo quality . The printer does not appear to have come with photo printing software . But ... one can print using the printer control panel and inserting an SD card in the printer 's SD card slot . That would force the printer to use its own algorithm to print the picture.I inserted an SD card and from the control panel , gave the instruction to print a photo . This time , it took much longer as the print head was obviously making much more numerous and detailed passes . I knew it would come out much better and it certainly did . It came out looking much more like a commercially printed photo . Is it ? Not exactly . To the trained eye , it is ever so slightly lower in quality , but to normal people it looks just like you paid to have it done . Looking at it with a jeweler 's magnifier , I could see that a commercial print is better , but who looks at photos through magnifying glasses ? : - ) This is a great printer all around - especially for the price !	1
I have to say up front that I love Epson printers , and would not own any other brand . Every Epson printer I have owned has been an excellent buy.That having been said , it 's to every consumer 's advantage to do their homework and find the best printer for their needs . If you 're someone who needs photo-quality printing , fax capabilities , duplexing , and advanced features like that , this is n't the printer for you . However , if you are someone that just needs an inexpensive printer with a small footprint that will do an excellent job with basic printing , the Epson XP-400 is not a bad choice.Set-up is a breeze , and we had no problem getting multiple devices to print with this machine . We tried a Mac laptop , a PC laptop , an iPhone and an iPad . All printed with no problems at all . The ease of setup and wireless capabilities would make this printer a wonderful option for a dorm room or class room . That it also works with Google 's Cloud Print is a bonus . Just one more reason this is a great printer for sharing.The prints on this , as with most Epson printers are excellent . Vibrant colors ... crisp and clear . Not quite the kind of photo quality you would get with a more expensive Epson , but good enough to make Grandma a print of the photo you took on your iPhone of her and the grandkids . She 'll be more than happy . A professional photographer may not be so happy ... so , again , in that case , choose a higher-end model.The color screen is really easy to use , as is the software , so , scans and copies are easy to do . No wireless scanning on this model though , which is a bit disappointing . That would really be ideal.Overall , this is a good , inexpensive printer that 's perfect for general family printing , dorm rooms , or even the office for jobs that are n't quality-critical .	1
One of the things that impressed me about this neat little printer is that it folds up into it 's own damage-proof `` box '' making it easily portable without fear of breaking anything . The control panel and paper feeder fold leaving a compact rectangle . The main thing I dislike is that the power plug does not fit tightly and unless one is very careful , it disconnects easily . Since I 'm often clumsy , it was hard to me to keep it connected and I had to put the surge protector in a position that would help assure it staying connected . Meanwhile , this little printer is quiet , offers a lot of selections right on the control panel without the necessity of changing the settings via my computer . I 'm not using the wireless feature . I doubt that I could use it with my dsl and I do n't have a wireless card in my desktop . For my laptop , it would be a simple matter to simply unplug the usb cable and replug into the laptop . It prints slowly but so does my larger , more expensive HP printer . As for the use of ink , I have n't used it enough to require replacement of cartridge ( s ) . I 'm not sure if the separate cartridges will save money or not . I suspect that the probably will . They are easy to insert compared to my HP printer . I print everything using the draft mode . You 'd be surprised at the ink you save with the draft mode setting . Installation goes easily and the printed guide is extremely helpful . I like the idea that I can print directly from a memory card . Here 's a real bonus ... you can automatically transform an old color photo into a much sharper photo as you scan ! There 's even a dust removal option ! Backlight correction removes shadows from images with too much background light . Your old Kodachrome snapshots can be enhanced without the need to use a photo editor ( usually ) and see the image on the display ! One other `` dislike '' , I have a tendency to press buttons too hard or too long and when I 'm setting the controls , I have a difficult time setting them . I might overcome this over time , though . All in all , this is one mighty powerful printer for a reasonably price and it 's easily transportable . A beauty to look at and use .	1
The Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-In-One Color Printer , Copier , Scanner is easy to set up and great to use from any computer in the house . It does have to have each computer you want to use set up individually in order to have them work but once it is done , it works fine . Copies and scans are clear and look great . Only complaint is that there is no USB cord included and it is needed to set up the printer with a computer . It seems an easy , inexpensive thing that should have been included . The digital read out and push controls are up to date and easy to use .	1
I 've never actually owned a scanner before , so I was happy to be able to get this from the Vine just for that feature . But this device does a lot more than just scan stuff . It 's also a regular printer and a copy machine ! I tried out all three modes and was satisfied with all of them . First I tried printing regular paper , which turned out as well as any inkjet printers I 'd ever owned . Next I tried scanning . The images looked a little fuzzy in my image software but when I posted it to Facebook it looked fine , so I think the problem was with my outdated software . And the copy feature works the same as any normal copy machine I 've ever used at work . Also just for fun I bought some photo paper to print out a couple of pictures . They do n't look quite as good as getting them from an actual photo store , but they are pretty good and of course it 's convenient to be able to print right from your own home instead of running down the road to the nearest pharmacy or Wal-Mart/Target/etc . and stand in line to get your pictures.The wireless works very well and makes the device much more convenient . I already have a laser printer so I did n't have room on my desk for another printer , but the WiFi allowed me to put this device across the room and still be able to do everything.Now the drawbacks . The number one drawback is this is an inkjet printer , which means it goes through a lot of ink and probably costs quite a bit to replace the four cartridges ( 1 black , 1 red , 1 yellow , and 1 blue ) inside . I also wish the size of the scanner were a little bigger for larger things I might want to scan . And the lid for the copier/scanner part came off when I took the device out of the box . It did snap right back on , but still it seems a bit flimsy.Anyway , this does what it claims to do pretty well so on the whole I recommend it if you 've been looking for a scanner/copier/inkjet printer . Though really if you just want to print a lot I 'd get a laser printer which cost less for maintenance and overall are about the same now for basic models.That is all .	1
I have too many printers set up at my house right now . I have a Canon 3-in-1 , an huge Epson photo printer , and now this Epson 400 series . I was looking for another one because the Canon is too finicky and while the other Epson works well , its really too high of quality for what I need most of the time . The Epson 400 series uses a reasonable amount of ink , prints fast , and has the ability to print higher quality photos when needed . It is a great all around printer for a good price , and it is extremely easy to set up and start using right away . Highly recommended .	1
I have had many Epson printers and currently use the Workforce 645 which is also excellent . Like that printer , the XP-400 is very easy to set up the wireless connection . There is a color LCD panel so you can see what will print when you are printing out photos . The color quality and sharpness are great ... Epson photo printouts are among the best . Scanning is easy . Making color or black and white copies of documents is easy . Has slots for memory cards . The thing that really puts this into the 5 star rating is the form factor . It is sleep and compact . I was surprised at how small it was compared to previous printers but it does not skip out on any functions . Great printer , recommended .	1
I 'm quite happy with this great little printer . It 's easy to set up ( via the software which downloaded without a glitch ) and works fabulously well wirelessly with my Wifi . This printer is so compact , and very quiet compared with my old Canon all-in-one . This does n't have fax capabilities , but you 'd typically pay more for that anyway.I find the prints themselves have great saturated color clarity ( very nice for photos , brochures , and other color projects ) . As with other inkjet printers you have 4 cartridges instead of one ( which is nice , you only need to replace the color your need the most ) . ALL inkjet printers ( the newer models ) are set up this way . I found that the ink lasts much longer than my old Pixma ( which seemed to eat ink like mad ) and the cartridges cost less than many other brands I 've used before . I have another Epson , and I recommend using a high output BLACK cartridge if you print alot of text documents or B & W ; documents . I happen to , and find that it takes me quite a bit longer to use up the color . The high output cartridge lasts about 2x longer.Now , other reviewers are saying you ca n't use this printer for high output printing ( and I do agree ) , but I think it 's unreasonable to expect a printer priced like this to work in that manner . I have a laser printer for those needs myself , it makes much more sense . If you 're looking for a great printer under $ 100 which is small & compact ( lightweight ) but can handle your printing needs ( as long as you 're not burning through ink with tons of copies ) this IS the printer for you . It 's wireless too , or you can use any USB cable from an old printer ( I tried it and it works fine ) if need be . I happen to have a few extra cables around just in case , so it 's not a big deal . Yet I can load up this little printer when I need to take my notebook on the road , and that 's convenient for business situations.I have tried many brands of printers over the years and am now an Epson convert . I doubt I will buy ANY other brand in the future .	1
This printer is a very basic model and certainly would be of use to someone who is concerned with a device that has a minimum footprint as far as the space it takes up . Notably , the Epson Expression does not have a fax , but not many folks use fax machines these days and it is a very simple matter to scan any document and transmit it electronically . The set up was easy and painless , and was finished inside of a half an hour out of the box . Ink refills are fairly inexpensive , so you won & # 8217 ; t be stuck buying $ 70 worth of ink every time you need to get a refill for all of the colours rather than just one.The unit itself is very sleek-looking , but it feels rather flimsy . I have had other Epson printers and I am not as fond of this one as I am other higher end products of the same line . For the money it & # 8217 ; s great . I definitely appreciated the Bluetooth printing capability because we have multiple printers in our household .	1
I have two printers ... this and the WF 3520 which is about double the price of the XP 400 , and I love them both but the WF3520 has a fax . Although I do n't use it often , it was worth it for me to have the fax feature . The great thing about the XP400 is the cartridges are really affordable compared to most other printers . Epson quality has went up in the last few years , even with their budget models . I love them for adding two sided copying even if it is manual !	1
I have a number of printers dotted around my house for convenience ranging from those that just plug directly into a computer to network printers that allow me to print from anywhere on my network . Usually the network printers take a little bit to get set up . With the Epson XP400 , from breaking the seal on the box to having it up and running took a total of 14 minutes and most of this was spent either waiting the computer to boot up or for the software to install . Setup was extremely easy with the supplied software , and with the built in wireless I can now print to this from anywhere.If you do n't wish to use the wireless feature of the printer you can plug it directly into your PC and use it as an attached device ( Note : USB cable not provided ) .The XP400 has a number of really good features for a low end printer/scanner including a smart card reader so that you can just take your memory card out of your camera and plug it directly into the printer . You can browse the images on the small LCD panel and do some basic photo manipulation including red-eye reduction and rotating and cropping of images before you print them out.Print quality is overall quite good . Print rate is n't the fastest I 've seen for a home printer , but it 's not the slowest either . About average with most printers in this price range.One great thing about this printer is that you can print directly from your ipad ( I tested this out from my iPad2 ) without having to connect to your computer , sync and then print from your computer.The one slight worry I have about this is that cartridges that come with the printer do n't appear to be very large ( it takes 4 seperate cartridges , black , cyan , magenta and yello ) and therefore I can see you having to buy new cartridges sooner than some other printers , however with good refill products available right here on amazon ( via third party companies ) this wo n't be too much of a problem ( ECOOLMART is a good one that I would recommend - http : //www.amazon.com/gp/aag/main ? ie=UTF8 & asin ; = & isAmazonFulfilled ; =1 & isCBA ; = & marketplaceID ; =ATVPDKIKX0DER & seller ; =A2P5QXBDU51LJA ) .The scanner allowes you to scan images upto 2400dpi ( more than you need for most things ) and scans documents and photographs in about the same time as most other scanners.Overall , you get a lot of features for a printer in this price range , its very easy to setup and works very well.Recommended if you are looking for a cheap and flexible all-in-one .	1
Great Printer . Easy to setup and has allot of neat things on it like many of the more expensive printers do . It is suppose to be efficient on ink so we will monitor and see .	1
There comes a time in each nerd 's ( or nerdette 's ) life when you have to admit that things have changed.Sometimes it 's obvious , such as a new technology being offered . Other times , it 's a recognition that things have changed ( when did you decide that the Internet was necessary to just about everyone ? ) .But the worst changes are those when people change the way they do things , but you 're still doing them the same old way . I 've spent over 20 years connecting printer cables to computers , using parallel ports , USB , and Ethernet . And I probably would have gone on doing that , if I had n't looked at other Amazon Reviews of this printer and the comments on them.What one reviewer said was that the printer did n't come with a USB cable . These days , I 'd be surprised to see a USB cable in the package ( selling them at high prices is how some chain electronics stores stay in business ) but commentators of the original review pointed out that you can ignore the cable and use your wireless network . And it occurred to me that with so many people having a wireless network at home , it 's time to consider wireless as the best way of connecting . All you need is a power wall socket nearby , and you can put the printer anywhere in the house . I tried to make the case for having my original printer in the living room when we moved ( Ethernet connection to the Router ) but my wife did n't like that . Now it can go anywhere - closets , bathrooms , and even garages if the temperature does n't dip below 50 degrees Fahrenheit when you 're printing , and -4 degrees for storage.When I first took it out of the box , I was reminded of - well , there must be something that it reminded me of , but I ca n't recall it - so lets just say it reminded me of a small printer . What impressed me was the way it ran - smoothly - and without any paper jams . The cartridges are available on Amazon and elsewhere for under $ 10 each color , and the large capacity cartridges should be available shortly . Epson says you can print to it directly from gadgets and using Apple and Google cloud print services.The printer has a small color LCD panel to see pictures that you get from a camera memory card ( It has sockets for camera cards ) , and you can also see what happens if you crop or rotate the image . There are image enhancement tools , and naturally the printer scans and copies documents.I 'd advise you to follow the instructions when installing the printer - follow the steps in the right order . This is true for most of the inkjet printers I 've installed . The process does n't take long . Do n't try to change things by pressing on the color image section of the control panel - use the icons instead.But once you install the software and run a few test pages , I think you 'll be very happy with this printer . And when you 're finished printing , fold away the paper guides and you 'll be impressed at just how compact it is .	1
Having had several printers in my home over the past few years I can tell you truthfully that I still do n't know a whole lot about them . For me they either work or do n't work . They are either easy to install or they are not . They are either fast or they are slow . They either make good copies or they do not.We use this printer in our home and home offices ( both my wife and I have our own office which is a good thing for more reasons than I can list . ) Our printing needs are very low volume and speed is not a factor with us . Also , due to the nature of our work ( mostly play , but indeed we do some work some of the time ) , the quality of the printing need not be of the highest of high grade.Now all that being said : This printer was amazingly easy to install . We have four computers ; two PCs and two lap tops . The whole job was done in about 20 minutes . This is rather outstanding when you consider that neither my wife nor I am what you would call whiz-bangs . Actually our computer and electronic device skills and knowledge boarders on pathetic and we need simple , simple and simple , which with this copier we got.As to the quality of print . I really do not feel that this is a photo quality printer . It is fine and dandy for making general copies but they are not of the quality that I would present as presents or place in the family photo album . It is good enough for what we use if for.The speed is not all that bad . This is most certainly not a copier I would use in a `` real '' office situation where time is a big factor but since I am retired I have plenty of time on my hands anyway so this is no big deal for me.We had not problems with the scanning feature . It sould be noted that there is no feed tray here and you must scan documents one at a time . For us this is no big deal though.All in all , for our limited needs this is a fine product and we have no complaints.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
This is a good solution for people who use mobile devices and wifi a lot.It 's fairly inexpensive , small and the ink is n't too expensive.I do use a router , but most of my internet time is still from a desktop pc . The ability to print when using the laptop is a plus . If I frequently used other mobile devices and services , I would use more of the features.Unless someone uses mobile devices and wifi a lot , I do n't see many advantages to this printer , copier , scanner.I have a $ 30 HP all-in-one that provides the same functions and has affordable ink cartridges.It all depends on whether or not someone has a need for the additional features . If they do , they would likely be very pleased with this device .	1
Before getting into the details , I have to admit that I really am a laser printer user . We 've had a laser printer in our house for 15 years - and I 've found them to be a lot faster & cheaper for everyday usage.Having said that , there are times where we need photo-quality prints , and that 's an area where even the best color lasers do n't hold a candle to these inexpensive inkjet printers . This XP-400 has proven to be no exception when it comes to excellent photo quality.We have ours connected to the wireless network , so all the computers in the house can access it - and it works great ! As I mentioned before , the print quality is excellent and the speed is pretty good too . It also gives us a simple little copy machine that we can use in a pinch.If there is a downside , it 's definitely the cost of ink . It seems like it runs out all the time - and I 'm always getting on the kids not to use color unless they absolutely need it . The cost of ink in these little printers can quickly overshadow the cost of the printer itself.Overall , if you 're wanting an inexpensive inkjet printer that prints great quality , then I would highly recommend this XP-400 from Epson !	1
this printer is much like my other epson , except that it ; s wireless . the pages print quickly , with crisp clear lines that do not smudge . however , i do wish the ink cartridges were less expensive . i find that taking down the contrast 1 notch and printing most of my black and white documents on 'draft ' conserve ink further . the color prints are beautiful !	1
The Epson Expression Home XP-400 All-In-oneColor Inkjet Printer , copier Scanner works really well.It gives you crisp clear wireless printing and very good copies .It also scans documents exceptionally well . Overall I think it is a great printer , I have used it for awhile now & I like It very much , it is a bit smaller in size than my other printer which gives me a little more desk space.I would highly recomend it .	1
I particularily like the fact this printer has individual ink cartridges versus the all-colors-in-one cartridges in other printers . I just hate to throw away unused ink just because one color runs out first , most always blue it seems . I was very surprised how much smaller and lighter this printer is compared to the Canon MX512 I am replacing . Epson has most of the same essential functions at a fraction of the space.Wireless setup went smoothly via the WPS setup option . This printer is so small and lightweight I can move or locate it anywhere in the house with no effort at all . Wireless scanning and printing work wonderfully . This scanner bed only accommodates up to 8.5X11 inch sheets . It will also scan to a local memory card . It has everything I want in a wireless printer.I scanned an 8X10 photo with a matte finish at 1200 DPI and it resulted in a 20 MByte file size . The scan took about 10 minutes . I processed it through Photoshop and saved it as high quality file . The resulting file size grew to 30 MBytes . I wanted to determine if the network print function would choke on a huge file size . I printed at the highest quality . The print took about five minutes to finish . The photo print quality was excellent . I scanned another glossy 8X10 photo at 1200 DPI and made no corrections and printed the photo . This photo file size was 12.5 MBytes - do n't know why it was a smaller file size . It took about the same amount of time to print , so I concluded that the wireless network speed does not contribute to the print time . On this print , the color is not so faithful to the original . It is okay , but not so great . The skin tone is off color . The blue and black colors are excellent , just not the skin tone . But in the first print I scanned , the skin tone is very good . Maybe it has something to do with a matte finish versus a glossy finish . There is certainly no problem with resolution - extremely good detail . I own anEpson Artisan 50 Color Inkjet Printer ( C11CA45201 ) printer as well . It does a better job of printing photos compared to this model.Overall , I 'm very pleased with this printer . It has the individual color ink cartridges that I think is important because ink is n't cheap . I like the very compact size especially here in a home environment - not obtrusive at all . With the wireless network feature , you can put the printer just about anywhere there is electrical power available . The software has a feature that allows remote printing via the internet . One option is through Epson 's website . The other is through Google , but that is still in the beta phase . I 've tried repeatedly to get set up via the Google site , but I finally gave up . It just keeps timing out . It does n't matter because Epson 's site works fine .	1
I use this printer at my business and I love it ( I also use a bigger Epson at the home office ) . It has a small footprint with fast printing . Connectivity to wifi is a breeze - I use Apple products at home and PC products at work and both connect easily . Ink does n't seem to be expensive , however , when the color inks run low it prevents you from printing even in black unless you jump through hoops to make some changes , so it kind of forces you to always have some ink in the reservoirs ( sneaky trick , Epson ) .The main thing I do n't like about this , but this is with any small printer like this , is how the paper sits on an angle behind the printer exposing it to all the dust and environment hazards in the air so when you go to print after not using it for a while there is a bunch of dust , etc on the first page.The touch screen LCD is great and easy to navigate through options . I 've had many printers and used to try and buy the cheapest options , but I am completely happy with Epson 's current line of printers , they just need to make one that has wireless scanning ( if you want to scan to your computer you have to attached a USB cable ) .Highly recommended .	1
I especially like printers that load in the back and not by a tray . This way , you can only use 1/2 a sheet if needed . This printer was very easy to set up . It prints great too . I also like that it is a compact style and takes up less room than the other printers that I have .	1
I am very please with this Epson Home printer , easy to install and to print . It does take a little longer than the one I used to use that was a laser printer those are really fast but for the good price it is a quality product .	1
One of the selling points of this little machine was that it used cheap ink . I do n't know -- I started a big print job with two sets of cartridges , one nearly full in the machine and one unopened on the shelf . I 'm down to one black , unopened , just hours later . That much ink got me about 60 pages of print . Ca n't print until more gets here ( small town , has to come from either Amazon or a big box office supply store 100 miles down the road ) So the ink is n't cheap -- I have to buy much more of it . If Epson comes out with high capacity color cartridges , I 'll happily pay the price . My old faithful , slow but steady , Epson C88+ , is chugging along turning out twice the prints at half the speed . And I can buy cartridges for it at either Walmart of the local supply store.That said . It 's a nice , small all-in-one . Quiet , fairly fast , good black text and above average color . Easy to set up . I 've used the scanner and the color copier each once -- and due to the above ink situation , the copier is n't going to get much use . A good machine for the sort of work I normally do . Small home office type stuff . But do n't expect it to be a work horse.My machine did n't come from Amazon . It was on sale at an Office Depot when I dropped in , and I was due for one . I liked the size and the price . The ink will come from Amazon , at least for now . Often , I 'm afraid .	1
This printer sat in its box for about a week , because I 'm not particularly good at setting up electronics . However , I gave in finally and figured it out . It was easy . There are step-by-step instructions included in the box , and my wireless signal cooperated well . I set it up in the kitchen first , next to my desk , and it worked beautifully.I have now moved it to the room where our desktop computer sits . I normally have to carry my Mac into that room , hook it to the printer , wait on everything to get booted up , and then print whatever I need to print . Now , I can turn it on in the morning , before we start our homeschool day , and print word finds and pop quizzes with the click of a button . Next , I will install the driver on my husband 's laptop , so he can use it as well.As for quality , the pages I have printed look wonderful . For variety in this review , I printed a few different documents.1 . Recipes for a friend : they look clear and pretty much exactly as they looked on my screen . These were printed directly from the web and I had no problems at all.2 . Crossword puzzle for my son : Looks perfect.3 . Word art : I created bright colored graphic art for the covers of my son 's folders . The color is bright and the images clear.UPDATEWe still love this printer . Actually , my husband 's office printer quit working and he went out and bought another printer like my Epson .	1
I am in shock about how COOL this is ! I have my Epson printer in a shed outside my house - the shed being my home office . While sitting in the living room , about 60 feet away and holding a 4 '' telephone in my hand , I was able to print out a 30 page PDF ! Technology is AWESOME ! I remember dialing up via phone to AOL and hearing the beeps and static - now we are at an age where I can take a 2mb file and wirelessly print it from my cell phone to a printer many feet away outside my house . Very cool . The print job looked and was handled perfectly by my XP-400 !	1
The Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer , Copier , Scanner is a small printer compared to other home-based consumer level printers . But do n't let the small size fool you : although small in size , its packs features and specs that can be compared to full-sized , all-in-one printers.My thoughts on this printer : Design : The Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One printer is small and compact , can be placed unobtrusively in a little corner of your work space or computer table.Flexibility & Functionality : Though lacking a fax function , the all-in-one printing flexibility of a printer , scanner and copier pretty much covers the basic printing needs a regular consumer would ever need from a printer . The ability to print from flash/memory cards adds to the functionality of this all-in-one printer . A 2.5-inch LCD with a touch-screen panel adds to the functionality of the XP-400 . With the EPSON Connect functionality , remote printing is made possible from either a smart phone or a tablet.Wireless : As more and more home networks adapts and transitions to wireless protocols , the Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One printer meets that demand by having the ability to be configured to function wirelessly . Needless to say , setting this up to work wirelessly with your network is also very easy.Performance : With printing speeds of 8.7ppm for black or plain documents and a 4.5ppm for documents requiring color , the Epson Expression Home XP-400 does n't belong to the top-notch scale as far as printing speeds are concerned . Nevertheless , unless your task requires you to print numerous copies of paper documents , the XP-400 satisfies my average printing needs . Scanning is also a snap , with a quality rating of up to 2400 dpi , you are assured of the highest resolution this printer can output with its scanner . Photo printing is another noteworthy feature of this printer . I printed a 4 X 6 photo from the XP-400 and the results were very good . Not as sharp as you would good from other high-end larger printers but the results were good enough to satisfy my needs . Plus , Epson inks are known for retaining their details and non-fading.Suffice to say , the Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer , Copier , Scanner has exceeded my expectations . The compact size packed with great features makes this truly a home-based printer . Highly recommended !	1
This wireless All-in-One is beautiful , compact , and easy to install . You unpack it , careful to remove all the protective tape , including inside the printer ( do n't forget that ) . Then you set the printer on your desktop , raise the paper support and connect the power cord to the back of the printer and plug it up to an electrical outlet . Next you load the ink cartridges and put paper in the printer . After that you insert the product CD and follow instructions on your computer screen . It took me a few minutes to install then check all of its functions . I 'm not very tech-savvy so it might take you smarties less time . : o ) Excellent print quality . I have n't tried printing any photographs yet . However everything else works perfectly fine . This size is what I needed for the limited space in my home office .	1
The Epson Expression has made a new convert here.It is so simple to use a teen , or a very techno oriented child ( under your parental supervision ) , or even I can set it up.And if I can do it , almost anyone can ! I chose to set it up using a wire.Although it is designed to be wireless , it works for me perfectly the way I like.The colors of the inks ( which are provided ) are crisp and brilliant.Transitions from printing to scanning are seamlessThank you , Epson , for this 5 star Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inket Printer ! jean	1
Over the years , I have become quite frustrated with HP products . While I will be the first to say that HP makes a great printer and associated software , the price of ink along with the poorest customer service I have ever encountered made me look for alternatives . Also with my HP All-In-One , an empty print cartridge meant I could not fax or scan . After getting fed up , I opted to give Epson a try.My initial impressions of the Epson XP-400 when I removed it from the box were favorable . The printer was nice and light . I like the box design which allows one to put a stack of paper or other objects on top of the printer without the worries of everything sliding off.I went through the configuration of the printer and installing the software on my PC as outlined in the directions . I found the directions to be almost spot on . The only deviation from the directions I encountered was that the directions indicate that an Auto Play window would appear when the CD is inserted . This did not happen in my case . I knew this was very easily overcome by navigating to the CD drive in Windows Explorer , but I can imagine this prompting a call to a child or grandchild to a person who might be very PC literate.Installing the printer mostly went event free . While testing the various functions , I ran into problems when I attempted to remotely scan a photo . When I tried to scan a photo , the printer would not list my PC as a destination and was listing a USB connection as the only option . After reading through the manual and looking at the Epson website , I found that the culprit was the Epson Event Manager software was not running . For some reason I need to manually run this program on my PC . I suspect I did not choose the right option during installation , so I do not fault Epson for this.The box and directions suggest having a USB cable , which is not included . I opted to go through the directions without one to simulate forgetting to buy one and not realizing it until I got home . It is incredibly easy to program the printer without the USB cable using the LCD screen and the buttons . This is a huge design improvement over my previous Epson wireless printer ( Workforce 60 ) which required me to cable up the printer and look up the procedure online to reprogram it every time there is a router change at my home.As I can get photos printed at Wal-Mart for less than $ 0.15 a print , I do not print photos at home . I thought document printing on this printer was just fine as was black and white copying . It took roughly 10 seconds to copy a text document on the printer.The scanning capabilities and the associated lack of software is where I think this printer fails . The time to scan a single item to the PC is 3 minutes While not a big deal for a scan or two , this will be a huge time issue if scanning in a pack of old 35mm photos . At this point , I realized one of the areas where HP shines is the software . My HP All-in-One would automatically suggest where to crop the object ( which was usually very accurate ) and gave me the opportunity to adjust the crop before the final scan . With Epson , there is no opportunity to crop a scan that I found , which will require it to be done manually.The printer prints documents just fine . I think that the physical design and footprint of the printer is excellent . The directions for installing the printer were very good . I really liked the ability to update the Wireless Router information without cabling up a PC . I found the scanning capabilities slow and the associated software quite lackluster . I did not like the lack of a fax machine , but I guess you can not have everything.If you are looking for a basic , wireless All-in-One printer then this one would work fine . If you are looking for a printer that a bit on the higher end and is a bit smarter with better software , then I would stick with HP .	1
***EPSON CONNECT OUTAGE NOTICE***I received an email last evening stating Epson Connect will be down the evening of Aug 28 , 2012 through the morning of Aug 29 , 2012 for upgrades . The exact time is dependent on time zone , obviously . I include this here for anyone trying to setup their new printer and not realizing why the Epson Connect ( remote printing ) is n't working . If you are outside of this time window and have issues , check with Epson for a possible outage ( very very rare ) . **** ***** **** ****This printer is a very basic , no frills printer , easy to setup , cheap to maintain . It 's cost is comparable to similar models , the big plus are the very inexpensive individual ink refills- low cost for continued use.This printer is ideal for someone who needs a basic inkjet color printer , low-cost ink , does not need a photo printer nor faxing capability and scans single pages at a time ( such as scanning photos ) .For what the printer is and what it is marketed as , it is a 5-star printer and I have rated it as such.This printer does NOT have a document feed tray - scans are a single page at a time.This printer is NOT an all-in-one as it does NOT include a fax.This printer is NOT a photo-quality printer.This printer does NOT come with a USB cable - as it is not needed on most wireless networks.If you need the above capabilities ( document feed tray , faxing , etc ) consider the Epson Workforce line of printers- they are also easy to setup , very reliable , and use reasonably priced consumables ( ink ) .	1
If you need a light-duty printer for home and perhaps student use , this is a good choice . It 's economical to buy and you do n't have to pay through the nose for ink . Print quality is good , scans are okay . And the unit is very small.The features you would want for even a basic home office , much less a full-scale office simply are n't present . No Automatic Document Feeder ( ADF ) , low paper tray capacity , no automatic duplex printing , relatively slow print speeds , limited ink supply , low scanner resolution , no fax capability . No USB port for plugging in Flash drives , but there is an SD card reader.You can control the unit from your computer or the built-in 2.5 inch color screen.WiFi setup is a snap , taking only a few minutes . If you want to do a USB hookup , you have to supply the USB cable.Print speeds are on the slow side , but nothing near turtle slow . Color prints are okay , but definitely not exhibition quality.This is an okay printer in environments where demand is low and somewhat less than optimum quality is needed . Well suited for a home , some students ( with light printed page needs ) or as a spare or secondary printer . Definitely not for a location with anything beyond the lightest printing demands . Scanning resolution is low , so do n't think of converting your slide library.For a few pages a day and photos , the XP-400 will do the job . But for more demanding loads and higher quality , look elsewhere.Jerry	1
I have owned several Epson printers and all-in-the ones over the years . As almost everyone knows at this point , Epson uses the buy this printer affordably and pay us lots and lots for the printer cartridges for life . As always , I offer this caveat - to get the most from your Epson printer buy the XL version of the cartridges ( not the normal cartridges that come with the printer ) when you go to replace them . These give you far more print for your dollar . Also , I set my settings to print black & white ; proof-quality as the default . But , with the new ability to print from anywhere this one provides - I may just change my mind on that for this go around.Here 's the things I really like about this one versus the previous Epson all-in-one I had:1 . It 's smaller - takes up much less space on the desk.2 . Print your photos from anything and anywhere directly to it easily - really ! During set up I received an email that I can send any picture to from anywhere - my office computer , my iphone , etc . to my printer . The easiest solution I 've found for turning my photos into hard copies from the iPhone.3 . Wi-fi ! No more having my printer take up one of my becoming increasingly more used , limited USB slots . Set up was easy ( though I had a USB cord handy - which may have made it easier ) . Now my laptops , desktop and everything are directly connected to it for printing -- - yay ! 4 . Print quality : Quality is dependent on the quality and paper you choose to do the job - which is as it should be . If you want a glossy , high-res pic - than print that on glossy paper ( I only really do this for special occassions ) . Everything else is crisp.Here 's a few things that could be improved - but , for me , they are mostly nits - since I do truly love the ease of using this printer easily with all my homes gadgets and the ability to access it from elsewhere ... 1 . The inclusions : Generally , with new printers , particularly ones that can be used for photos you get a few sample sheets to test it out on the fancier paper - not with this one . Plus , my Wi-fi set up was easy because I did have the right type of USB cords laying around - but may not be so for others who don't.2 . There 's almost too many options for saving your items to be printed in the cloud . Once I was on-board with the Epson connect verssion - I gave up trying to get myself signed up for the Google Cloud Beta.3 . Speed : It 's not the fastest printing machine around , but it works for what I need for small business and home stuff at an appropriate speed . You 'll want to compare speeds for yourself to see if it 's for you.Bottom Line : 4.5 stars . Great , economical , wi-fi access all-in-one that does everything it should do , plus some . Does n't take up too much space , has easy set-up and let 's you ( and others you authorize ) print to it from virtually anything and anywhere . Caveats : Watch your settings and the type of print cartridges you buy to make sure it stays economical - and check out whether you have a USB cord for set-up prior to purchasing .	1
Set up was a breeze . The instructions were very clear . It 's so great to have a wireless printer.Print quality is good , and it is quite fast as well . The printer is very lightweight and easy to move if , like me , you are short on space and have to rearrange a lot . And not having it cabled to my laptop is even more helpful.I 'm very happy with this little printer and can recommend it for home use .	1
This is a fairly basic printer , at least in terms of quality . However , it does connect over your wireless network and is capable of printing from mobile devices . The best thing is it 's small footprint which makes it ideal for tight spaces.It took me about 15 minutes to properly setup the printer over my wireless network , configure Epson Connect , etc . My netbook does not have a CD drive , so I had to download the driver and software from the Epson website . It 's been working great for two weeks . The print quality is good enough for most needs ( do n't expect laser quality out of this guy ) , and the scans are decent quality .	1
I am a HUGE fan of Epson scanners , I have several and with the happy addition of the XP-400 I now have an Epson All-in-One in both of my offices.This well named Small-in-One printer/scanner/copier really delivers like I hoped it would.My Epson 's are what I prefer and use with my Mac & HP Laptops , in both of my offices.The printer deliver 's great quality in both my standard sheets of paper printings and beautiful photos as well , a real winner.This is an amazing deal at this price and it would be a nice setup for a student or any user , it 's such a great bargain !	1
I have used many printers in the past and I used to be a pro-Canon person . I was asked by a friend of mine to fine a nice affordable printer for him so I did research to find this printer to be the best option based on the feedback and functions . After I received the package , I went off to set it up for him , and found so easy to do ! The wireless set up is flawless , unlike my Canon MP series printer , which I ca n't even connect to wifi . I connected to the wifi in a minute , and set up was done ! It 's a very compact size to have this many functions . Print quality is excellent , though when it comes to photo printing at high quality , it takes QUITE a long time to finish , but the quality is amazing . If you are in a hurry to print out a photo at high-res most of the time , you should look for other printers . Black and white takes as it should for any ink-jet printers . Noise it makes is not too quiet but all ink-jet printer has the same level . The front interface is very easy to navigate touch panel . I totally recommend this printer , you wo n't regret it for the money !	1
Pros : * Photo print quality slightly above average for this class of printer* Small footprint* Does n't require attached computer to print , scan , copy* Very clear and easy to use built-in control panel and menus* SD Memory Card slot allows printing photos directly* Photo preview on printer LCD panel* Wireless ! Cons : * Power cord attachment to printer is flaky* Slow as snot* Per page costs nothing to rave about at 5-7 cents/page ( you pay for higher quality ) Review : The Epson Expression Home XP-400 is pretty much your standard light-use home printer/scanner/copier . Epson recommends attaching the printer to computer with a USB cable which is not included ( deal with it ) . I did all setup via wireless and had no problems . Set-up was easy and took about 20 minutes including 4 minutes of printer cartridge `` priming . '' There is an unadvertised Wi-Fi Protected Setup - WPS menu option . I used the wireless setup option from the LCD screen and had no problem manually selecting my network and entering my password . I installed the printer software from the CD after putting the printer on my network and the printer was found immediately . My only minor complaint about the physical object itself is that the power cord never seemed to seat tightly into the printer which was a concern during setup with all the `` do n't turn off '' messages . The footprint is on the small side for an all-in-one ( scan-print-copy no fax ) device.Quality of printing ? TheDURABrite printer cartridges ( plural - you need four : Black and white , cyan , magenta , yellow ) gives better than average photo prints , especially if you use higher quality photo paper . Photo paper printing will up your per page costs to around 20-25 cents per print . Having multiple cartridges is often advertised as `` replace only what you 've used '' but in my experience does n't really come into play . The exception is the black and white cartridge can get used up pretty quickly if you do a lot of text page printing . Cartridges are in vacuum sealed pouches , and can be stored for up to 24 months without drying out.Slow speed is an issue but is typical for this class . I would n't recommend this for any small office setting . Printing out a letter sized color photo took several minutes . Scanning is also very slow - for some reason each scan requires two passes of the scan head . I had hopes to use this to scan directly to an inserted memory card , which you can do , but when it took about five minutes to scan three photos , I realized this would n't be a detached scanning workstation for me . Nice , but not a great feature , is that SD cards inserted in the printer show up on my network . Anyway , I have to stress that scanning is easy to do , just slow . Casual use = good . Lots of activity = you will go crazy . There is no paper feeder so you ca n't stack up something to scan or copy and walk away.The LCD screen and menu are bright and clear . The menu options and controls are very easy to use . Being wireless , I ca n't see ever going back to wired printers.Four out of five stars for being a solid light-use unit with nice quality of print . One star removed for the flaky power cord and slowness .	1
I was n't sure if I would be happy with this little printer or not . Surprisingly the longer I 've been using it the more I like it . While I do not feel it is a 5 star printer , it is up there when you consider what you get for the price.First it has a small footprint but do n't let that fool you , it has a good amount of features . My previous printer was a big fancy Canon with all the bells & whistles . One day it decided to stop working . I think I had it for a little over a year . An error message came up & that was it . I was pretty upset because I work from home & need the printer for obvious reasons . I immediately ordered a Epson printer with all the bells & whistles . About a week later I got this printer as well . So far I have not needed the more expensive Epson as this little bugger does everything I need it too ! I feel a lot better now that I have a back up printer.My peeves first : -When using the scanner the image does not transfer all the details of the original . This is a huge problem for me when it comes to the fine lines on ledger paper.-Second is the paper feeder . I print out a lot of product labels . If the paper does n't sit exactly right in the tray , the labels are ruined . I used the bottom loader in my Canon & never ever had a problem with labels.-Third the wireless does n't always work . I can not figure out why.What I like : -The colors are fabulous ! Truly vibrant compared to my Canon.-The touch screen is on the front of the printer . At first I did n't like it . I quickly got used to it & realized , `` Wow this is great ! '' The screen can also tilt up for you to view if needed.-The ink that comes with the printer does not last as long as the ink you buy separately . At first I thought the ink was way overpriced but after installing new purchased ink , it is lasting much longer & I have no complaints . My ink use so far:8-22 started using printer.9-14 need black ink ( ink sent with printer lasted 3 weeks ) .9-26 replaced yellow ink.10-22 have not replaced any ink since 9-26.-The printer is easy to set up & easy to use ( except for already mentioned wireless issues ) .-Does n't take up a lot of space.If you do not have to print out labels or something similar , I highly recommend this little printer . So far it has turned out to be a fine little machine for the price .	1
This is one amazing printer . We truly love it . It 's small , but performs just like a printer of twice the size.Set-up took all of 10 minutes . The wireless printing is an excellent feature . I especially like the touch screen.We have n't had to replace the ink cartridges yet , but you can buy the individual color cartridges ( instead of , say , a tri-color cartridge like that other manufacturer 's ) so you can replace only the colors that run out . It saves money.Perfect for a college student .	1
This printer has a nice square form - it does n't have a fax or anything fancy on top so it is just like a medium size square box . You can sit things on it . They do n't fall off . I like that because I 'm ALWAYS sitting things on the printer and I have one that they DO fall off of , and it 's annoying . This one is n't annoying like that , I have a stack of books on it now trying to hide the paper feed from my two cats.Wireless set up is super easy . It scans , finds your network , you put in your passcode , and it works . It 's that simple on a wireless network . The wizard is on the front and it is super easy - it walks you though step by step.Mobile printing is easy to set up as well - just download the Epson Connect app. , and register for an account . You will get an Epson connect email . I set it up with my HTC One X and it was *Super easy . * You can email anything to the Epson Connect address that that you need printed . It will NOT print coupons like that though - Instead you will get a link TO your coupons printed out , which is useless . It 's not a problem with the printer but mobile printing in general . I wish someone could fix this , and I thought I 'd mention it b/c it was something I had been hoping to do.It prints fairly fast and has produces a print quality that is very good on regular settings . I have NO PROBLEMS with bar codes printed on this printer scanning.One thing I do not like is that it does not have a paper tray - you have to stick the paper in the back and it shoots out the front . That can be a problem with my cats as they are fascinated by the paper moving and often try to attack it . The software driver has not been 'naggy ' and has not slowed any of my computers down . If you 're going to be using this printer a LOT , look at the workforce 645 with its huge slide-in paper tray , because I feel like I 'm always putting more paper in this one , or fixing the paper where the cats have attacked it .	1
My husband would be the first to tell you I 'm not a techie . But I found this printer to be painless to install and a real joy to use.1 ) Before we discuss the actual device , I first want to praise the packaging of all things . Frankly , I was shocked at how small the box was when the printer came in the mail . This is a model of how printers ought to be packaged.2 ) The quick installation sheet that came with the printer was easy to understand and follow . Like I said , painless . The one caveat here is that I just updated to OSX Mountain Lion , and the installer that came on the enclosed CD said it was incompatible with my operating system . I knew that the next thing to do was to go to Epson 's web site and download an updated , Mountain Lion-friendly driver , and sure enough , Epson 's website almost intuited that this was what I was looking for . I only wish , for the sake of others perhaps less experienced in this sort of thing , that Epson had taken the time to add `` Please visit our website for appropriate installation software '' or something to that effect to the `` incompatible with your system '' dialog on the original install program.3 ) The LED control panel is incredible . It 's easy to read and very easy to use , even with just four arrows and an `` OK '' key . Really that 's all you need . The fact that I could actually key in my lower-case wireless router password is a big plus overthe last wireless printer I installedand I mean BIG PLUS.4 ) Oh and this printer also has an SD slot for printing photos straight off memory media , again unlikethe last wireless printer I installed.5 ) The printer works really well with OSX 's built-in Image Capture program , which is smart on Epson 's part as other printer manufacturers would just have tried to craft their own substitute which would not have been nearly as good . Why reinvent wheels unnecessarily ? 6 ) My only real gripe with this device ( other than the fact that I had to figure out on my own to download my installation software directly from Epson and which I do n't think is really a gripe given how recently Mountain Lion was released ) is that it does n't have a document feeder for the copier / scanner as far as I can tell . This has the potential to be a real nuisance for anyone who needs to copy or scan more than three pages at a time . In my case , however , I can just use myother wireless printerwhich does have a document feeder for its copier / scanner , but I 'm under no real illusions that most people have spare copiers lying around at home.But , as I said , this is a great buy for its price point , and recommended.Please let me know if this review was helpful .	1
I am not the most tech savvy individual , however I was able to set this printer up in no time just following the instructions and installing the included disc . Paper tray is sturdy , print quality and speed is good . Very please with this lightweight printer that takes up so little space !	1
I have a large wide format Epson printer that I really like but is too large to be close to where I work most of the time . So this smaller , compact sized multi-format printer seemed the perfect thing to put near my workstation , to handle quick scans particularly of photos that require a flatbed and cheap print jobs.Overall , I 'm pretty happy with it . It can fit four 4x6 prints for scanning , and the quality has been pretty good . Setup with the Wifi was every bit as easy as the other Epson and no problems sending jobs from my iPad . I have a separate document scanner that I use for the majority of multi-document scans , and since this does n't have a ADF , it 's not a good choice if scanning is a big feature you are looking for . The printing is okay , but it also would n't be my first choice if good photo prints was something you need . I also find that both this Epson and my other one routinely seem to have problems with my Mac , but not sure if Epson or Apple is to blame for that but it 's very frustrating when I need to scan a photo and the Mac refuses to see the devices that are there.So this printer meets my needs for the most part , if it did n't have random connection issues I 'd be happier but it does the job for me .	1
I 've been using this actively for a couple of months now and I could n't be more pleased with this little printer/all-in-one.First , I 'm not exaggerating when I say I had this thing hooked up and printing wirelessly from my ipad , iphone , and computers within 10 minutes of taking it out of the box . The prompts on the display and easy instructions were intuitive and easy to follow . It was almost as easy as connecting to free public wifi networks.I print in full color pretty much all the time , at least a couple things each day , and so far no need to replace any of the ink . The saturation is nice and it dries quickly . No smearing.I 've scanned and copied and found both were satisfactory . Scanning was easy to do . For some reason , the copying was a little slow , but with such a small footprint for an all-in-one I 'll take that small delay.I would easily recommend this product .	1
This is a great all-purpose printer/copier/scanner , perfect for the whole family to use . It 's extremely easy to set up and begin using . What I like best about it is that it does n't take up too much space , and also that the ink cartridges are relatively inexpensive . If your printing needs are pretty minimal and you just need a good quality , lower-end printer , then this is a good choice for you . It 's not as fancy or as high-tech as some pricier models , but it will get the job done .	1
I bought this printer specifically for my wife and son so they could print from their iPad Minis and iPhone/iTouch using AirPrint . The instructions were easy and accurate , and the entire setup was super easy . The printer works great with these devices right out of the box . The best part , I now have my non-compatible AirPrint Cannon printer to myself . No more running out of ink when I need it most . : - )	1
I really like this printer . It 's not a great photo printer ( and it eats up ink like nobody 's business ) , so I just use it for basic things like documents that might have simple color images . The copier and scanner work as they should - it makes good copies , and I 've been scanning some old photos and it works very well for that.I 'm glad I kept my old printer cable though , because I ca n't get this thing to work wirelessly with my 5 year old Apple iMac ( running the Snow Leopard operating system ) . It 's not the printer 's fault - the printer sees my computer 's wi-fi , but my computer does n't acknowledge the existence of the printer at all . I 've tried all kinds of updates , to no avail ( except for upgrading to Mountain Lion for my operating system , I have n't done that yet ) . My husband was able to print a few times wirelessly with this printer from his 3 year old MacBook when he was using Leopard , but since he updated to Snow Leopard he has n't been able to print wirelessly.For me , my wireless issue is probably a problem of older Macs that do n't have the most up-to-date operating systems , combined with `` operator error '' because I have only basic computer skills . I gave up after a few hours of trying to get the printer to work with my computer wirelessly , because I had that old printer cable to fall back on . It 's a 5 year old cable that I used for my old Canon printer , but it works for this printer too - my iMac had no trouble at all working with the printer using the cable , they both recognized each other and connected fine .	1
I first installed the printer with a USB connection one one workstation and then wirelessly through the network on another . My first install had a problem with the fax software and I had to do it over . The wireless set up for the second was super easy , thanks to a video on Epson 's website . In both cases , the `` print test page '' button did not work but when I created a test Word document that printed fine . Print quality seems good , we 've got it set on draft mode so as to save ink since this is just mostly for inner-office documents for a guy who 's too busy ( lazy ) to walk out to the main printer to pick up his print jobs . I think this is intended more for household or home office use than professional use but it seems well made and has all the features commonly found in today 's all in ones-in a really compact and attractive presentation . I especially like the separate ink tanks so you only replace what you actually have used . I plan to try refilled ink cartridges but since the printer is so new , I do n't they are widely available yet .	1
So , this printer did n't impress me in terms of its print quality or print speed . Given its price , I expected acceptable quality and speed ... nothing spectactular ... and that 's exactly what I got . For day-to-day basic printing needs , this is a decent printer . Epson emphasizes that this is a `` small '' -in-one printer . I did n't really notice that this was much smaller than other printers I 've used . The printer lacks a document-feeder , and it lacks faxing functionality . For most of what I do , this is irrelevant . If you need either of these features , you 'll need to look elsewhere.What DID impress me was the simplicity of the setup , and how easy it was to use the printer from practically every computing device I own . Here are the details:1 ) Setup was a breeze . The instructions said that I could set it up using USB or wireless , but that USB was `` recommended '' . I felt comfortable enough with wireless that I decided to skip the USB cable . Everything installed without a hitch . Once the drivers were installed , it checked to see if there were any firmware updates . An update was found and it , too , was installed wirelessly . There were a couple options for the wireless installation : one where you need to know the password for your wi-fi network , and the simpler WPS option ( push a button on the router , and skip the password ) . I went with WPS , and the printer and router immediately `` found '' one another . Wireless setup is a great way to go . It means you can put the printer wherever you want in your home or business , and never need to worry about connecting the printer to your computer . By contrast , my previous printer was a Canon MX-432 multifunction printer that allowed for wireless setup , but could only install the firmware update by connecting a USB cable.2 ) It prints from EVERYTHING . In my opinion , this is where Epson beats all the other printers I 've ever used . The installer walked me through all the necessary steps to allow my printer to use Apple 's AirPrint ( for printing from iPhones , iPads , and other iOS devices ) , Google 's Cloud Print ( for printing from anywhere that you have web access ) , and e-mail ( which lets you send documents to a printer-specific e-mail address ... documents sent to that e-mail address get printed automatically ) . I tested out all these features , and was able to successfully print : * from an iPad ( no special software or app needed ... AirPrint just works automatically from nearly any iOS device from the past few years ) * from a Windows 7 PC ( after installing Epson 's drivers ) * from a MacBook Air ( after installing Epson 's drivers ) * from a Google Nexus 7 ( Android printing is easily accomplished using a freely available Cloud Print app that makes use of Google 's Cloud Print service ) * from an e-mail sent using my iPhone ( by sending it to my Epson-assigned e-mail address ) 3 ) I can scan over wi-fi : The touch panel on the printer makes scanning a breeze . Once I installed the Epson drivers on my PC and my Mac , pressing the `` Scan '' option on the printer allowed me to select which computer should receive the scanned document . Additional configuration on my PC allowed me to specify a destination folder for future scans.4 ) Many convenient configuration options : Once the drivers are installed , I was able to set up an account with Epson ( they call it `` Epson Connect '' ) . This account lets me use a web browser to go online and fine tune the options for my printer . For example , I can set up a shortcut that makes it easy to scan and e-mail documents to my wife . Once I 've set it up on the `` Epson Connect '' site , an option will appear on the printer 's touch screen that lets me choose `` Jane '' as the destination for a particular scan . I tested it out : Put a document on the scanner , 4 taps on the touch screen , and a minute later my wife had a pdf in her inbox containing that document.In short , the ease of setup and the ease of printing and scanning between the printer and nearly any other device make this an excellent printer for my needs . No-hassle connectivity paired with decent print/scan quality , all at a very competitive price point make this a great choice for a home printer !	1
The printer is sleek and easy to setup/use . I print to it wirelessly from a Windows 7 PC ( on which is was a breeze to setup ) and my Android phone ( using the Epson app for it ) . Print quality is fairly good although not a bit less vivid than my Workforce845 printer ( also an Epson ) . The printout was a bit more even on the XP400 but perhaps that 's because it 's brand new and heads lose alignment over time . Do extend the output tray as without it the paper hanging down pull seems to cause some mild banding at the end of the paper that prints last . The printer is average size to a `` desk-top '' kind of printer and the slanted paper feeder makes it easy to push it to the edge of the desk and against a wall . Print time also seems average . The touch control panel is responsive and the menu system is easy enough to use without a manual . Note that despite the all-in-one moniker there is n't a fax unit in this printer.Overall it 's a good printer , ink replacement ( even OEM ) seem reasonably priced but if fax and faster printing is what you 're after you might be better off with a Workforce845 or the like .	1
This is a great little printer . It is easy to set up and very easy to use . The wireless worked great and now I can print from any room in my house.I was impressed . The touch pad makes it easy to choose which option you want to use . I am glad I have it as part of my home office !	1
Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer , Copier , Scanner ( C11CC07201 ) I was pleasantly surprised to see that this printer is small and compact . I really love this size which is almost half the size of my other printers . The shiny sleek black color is awesome as well.The set up for this Epson was a total breeze ! I turned on the printer and installed the ink cartridges and then printed a test page . After leaving the printer on I put the CD in my computer to install drivers and set up the wireless capability . It does ask you to use a USB cable but that is NOT necessary as you can use the printer screen to set up the wireless setup . The prompts from the Cd 's program ( set up wizard ) are short and very simple to follow . Maybe five minutes to go through the process . After registering , you get an email with a 10 % coupon to the Epson store should you need paper or any other photo printing items.I had another Epson printer ( RX500 ) which I totally loved but was damaged in a move . I had always gotten so many compliments when I showed my photos to people , so I had high expectations for this printer . However I do n't think the saturation levels are as deep and I have to admit I am a little disappointed , I do , however , prefer the deep saturation and very bright coloring . Some might think my preference is too saturated . I am assuming that this is because there are 4 ink cartridges as opposed to 5 with my other printers . The important thing to remember is that the photo paper and the quality of your camera will make a difference in results ! I have printed photos from different cameras with different paper ( Kodak gloss and high gloss and matte ) and overall the pictures are quality and overall this is a very good printer.I printed several family photos , nature scenes and other odds and ends from my computer.The scanner scans black and white in seconds but the printing took forever . So I went back into options and had to switch to text and uncheck the fit to paper box and change the paper from photo to plain paper . So then it printed very quickly . The color of the black from a scan after being printed is fine , lighter than a regular printed copy . Scanning a color photo was just as quick but a little longer to print . Printing 2 4x6 on one page was a minute or so . Overall not long and the printing is quiet.Printing documents in black and white were quick and very good.After printing 1 8x10 , 10 4x6 and 2 5x7 photos and several black and white documents I have close to full black ink , yellow is less than 1/4 gone , magenta is a little more than 1/4 gone and cyan is almost 3/4 gone . ( I printed with a lot of blue-sea background ) . The ink cartridges on Epson dot com range from $ 8.99 single color to 12.99 for black ink . For the XL size for black is 29.99 and color XL is 16.99 ( the XL provide 50 % more print out . ) The 3 pack of colors is 24.99.I like this printer for the quality of photos and the compactness and ease of use . If you have any questions , post a comment and I will answer as best as I can .	1
For the price , the Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer is pretty good.The shiny black finish and compact footprint make this an attractive unit . Press the control panel and it pops out at an angle from the front of the printer . That makes it easy to see , but the symbols on the screen are n't very intuitive . The onscreen keyboard uses arrows to move between letters and numbers , which makes entering a 28+ character wireless key a maddening experience.There is a built in paper holder in the back of the unit , with a slider bar that lets you adjust for paper width . There is also a built in paper catcher in the front of the unit . These paper guides slide out for use and can be slid back into the printer body if it needs to be stowed away or moved . The paper feed mechanism works smoothly . I 've used regular paper and glossy photo paper and the printer has never failed to feed the sheets through.The ink cartridges are very small and feel somewhat flimsy . Although the cartridges are relatively inexpensive they are consumed quickly . After printing a 30 page black and white text document and three 8x10 color photos , I was getting notifications to change the ink cartridges . This printer takes four cartridges : black , cyan , magenta and yellow . Standard size cartridges are sold for about $ 12 each , although the three colors are available in a multipack for about $ 25.For a printer that requires four ink cartridges I have to say the quality of photo printing is very disappointing . I used the `` best photo quality '' setting and high quality , glossy photo paper but the resulting photo was no better than a medium quality draft . Also , printing an 8x10 `` best quality '' photo takes over five minutes ; it feels like an eternity just waiting for the first edge of the paper to come out of the printer.A software disk is included in the package . When you submit something to print from your computer or device , this is where you specify photo quality , whether reverse order printing is required , or any other `` special '' commands . ( I 've been used to printers that just assume a multipage document needs to be printed so that the last page comes out first and the first page is on the top of the stack of printed pages . It is taking some getting used to to remember to request that . ) As others have noted , this printer does not have faxing capability and therefore does n't qualify as a true all-in-one . Faxes are becoming more rare every day , but if you need that feature this is not the unit for you.If you want an inexpensive printer for light use in printing emails , information from websites , b & w ; Word documents , etc . then this is an excellent choice . If you need something heavy duty for an office , or if you need better quality photo printing , then plan on spending a bit more for a better printer .	1
To me , I am continually amazed and stunned to think that every time I re-ink my venerable old HP P1000 , which has given me over ten years of relatively trouble free service , I could probably have purchased over 20 of these new generation multi-function devices . Obviously , had they existed.I have , in fact , never cared for them anyway- the first ones were overpriced , slow and clunky- and even as today , if one feature fails , you lose all the others . But with the price so low , who cares ? Not even worth repairing , just go buy another one , it 's probably a better unit anyway . I also have an intense hatred for our disposable consumerist society , built on the back of what is essentially slave labor , but we 'll skip that for now.This is my first hands on with the hateful 3-in-1 , and much to my surprise , it is not particularly hateful at all . It is cheap- and while it does n't show just looking at it , touching it reveals a bargain basement level of constructions and materials . The control panel buttons are kind of scrunchy and imprecise , the text small enough to be a challenge to read ( for older eyes ) Setup is fairly straightforward , although there are a few different ways to go about it . After the usual routine of installing the software , easiest is to simply enter your router name and password and wait for it to see everything . Best to have all computers on your net on as well , and while not necessary , it seems logical to install the software on each one too , so you can take advantage of things like the scanner control panel , monitoring ink levels , the user 's manual , etc.Which you will need , the 2 `` quick start '' guides , while better than many I have seen , provide only rudimentary information.Epson will continually hound you and deny you certain features unless you register the printer . There is no way around it , and I can not completely understand the thinking behind this . Most- almost all- devices and software I have used for many , many years ( except for Microsoft lately ) has always given you the option of `` Register Later '' or `` Do n't Remind Me Again '' .It will take many more hours to fully assess the XP-400 's capabilities and features , so you may wish to check back in a week or so . ( It 's ironic that they named it `` XP '' when a few of the unit 's features will not work under Windows XP . ) This is something not easily discovered , I believe it is the `` scan to computer '' ( so far ) that is only supported by Vista and 7.In any case , once everyone on your net can see it , and vice versa , it is a perfectly competent little machine , maybe to be used as a second printer , since most other users will probably already have a printing setupPrinting : B & W ; is extremely fast via wireless , I did not test the USB cable , but that may yet happen . I decided a 3 way test was in order , the contenders , a 64 bit Sony Vaio using Wifi and 7 , a 32 bit Lenovo XP using a network cable @ 100mb , and the main rig , an HP 7500 , 32 but , XP , with a direct USB connection to the HP P-1000 . The test pages were the standard Windows test page , and a 650 word Word document.HP : Test Page- 30 seconds . Word doc- 20 secondsLenovo : Test page , 25 seconds . Word doc , 20 secondsVaio : Test page , 15 seconds . Word doc , 23 seconds.So there are the early numbers , I was a little surprised . I think the Epson makes so much noise and banging around , that it seems to be going faster than it was . The difference in the test page I believe are probably largely due to the speed of the Sony and the way 7 generates a test page- much faster.Draw your own conclusion , I call it even . Which , given the varieties of configurations , is not too bad . I am sure Cnet or someone has gone even more overboard in much more detailed tests , but this is just your humble reviewer.Now , color : I prepared a 432 X 287 pixel image for a head-to-head against the HP . Medium quality , plain paper.HP via USB : 42 secondsEpson via WiFi:16 secondsI was impressed . But not until I print high-quality , photo real shots will I make a call . The Epson did seem to drop some detail , and the hues were not quite right . But if you do n't want gallery quality prints , I do not think the difference will trouble you.Oh yeah : the printer will also display on it 's LCD screen and print directly from any number of memory cards . There seems to be no native ability for image scaling , so be sure you are not trying to print a 23 '' X 40 '' image.Copying : Using the same test photo as in the print test , the Epson produced a decent replica in 43 seconds.Scanning : Now it gets complicated . The XP gives you almost too many choices . First is scanning from the machine 's control panel , where we find the following choices : Scan to Memory Card , Scan to PC , Scan to PC ( PDF ) Scan to PC ( Email ) Scan to PC ( WSD ) - here 's the `` Vista and 7 only '' club . However , it did scan to my XP machine as a PDF , even though it did not recognize it earlier.In my opinion , these are far too many choices for the average user , and most of them will be frustrating to complete successfully . Unless the user is well versed in the minutiae of the various choices , I would suggest scanning to the card . Easily dealt with , no computer has to be on , and it can be a Windows 98 machine for all I know.And next is the Epson Scan Software- based in any one of the using computers , here again are too many choices . But at least they are spelled out a bit more coherently.I have to take a moment to question the logic of a wireless scanner- in most if not all cases the operator needs to be standing at the scanner , and usually at the `` control panel '' on the PC . Unless one has a document feeder , it seems like scanning using any other method than a memory card would involve a lot of running back and forth and just seems silly . I set up the Sony right alongside the Epson and it settled the issue . In almost all cases , the user has no control as to where the scanned image ends up . Most people have accepted the whole `` My Documents , My Pictures '' structure , but not I.There is also a built-in restoration and correction tool , I made a conscious choice not to go there . I am sure , for the average non PhotoShop endowed user it works fine.Long review for such an inexpensive products- I think I have written far fewer words about electronics costing six times this much . Maybe that means the Epson is an overachiever ? I feel that is so . It does too much for any machine costing this little , there has to be a catch . Only time will tell . Hard disks are rated with a notation called `` MTBF '' - `` mean time between failure '' - this is the discernment here , if it is as short as I fear , you will be buying yet more plastic destined for the Great Pacific Garbage Patch .	1
It 's a nice price ( on sale for $ 70 as I write this ) for the quality of prints . I do n't like that they call it a `` small-in-one '' as I was thinking it 'd be a compact , smaller printer . But instead the printer is just as large as the other all-in-one printers I 've bought in the past . It 's okay , but definitely not small . I was hoping for something easier to store . But I guess it 's small for an Epson printer ! I ca n't complain about the print or scan quality . And I love the smartphone and tablet print capability . I can never get other wireless printers to work correctly .	1
I 've had the better part of 3 weeks now to demo this unit and I have to say it 's been wonderful . It 's space saving size fits perfectly in the living room and in connected to every type of system we set up on the WiFi . It accepts printing from my Ipad 1 and 3 , my droid phone , and my macbook.In checking with purchasing extra cartridges I found the color ink to sell between $ 8- $ 11 , and the black from $ 11- $ 15 dollar a piece . I 'm currently using it for general document printing , and graphs . We have a photo printer for the 4x6 images we need , and this unit excels at the basics , so no need to try to reinvent the wheel with this unit . It does print nice photos , but I 'd rather use a photo specific printer for that task , to keep this one freed up for my daily workhorse printing needs.Set up was right out of the box and in less than 15 minutes I had everything hooked up and the I was printing from my iPad 3 . Some say this printer feel flimsy , but to me it feels pretty solid and fits the need I have for an economy printer with inexpensive cartridges.Total package - it 's a winner , with great features such as wireless printing , effortless scanning , excellent copying , you can not go wrong for the price . I 've had no issues and this unit replaced a Kodak 5250 that was thrown in the trash . Kodak wanted me to pay for new ink and print head to fix their problem , not anymore , I 'm an Epson printer fan now .	1
The first thing you notice when taking the Epson out of the box is its compact size and light weight . It should be noted that the printer does not include a fax function . Also , it does not have a document feeder ; you have to individually copy or scan each page of a document . While there is no paper tray on the bottom of the printer , there is a slanted paper feeder you can pull out on the back of the printer . There is also an output tray that you can pull out from the bottom of the printer . The printer also features an LCD touch screen control panel , and the menu system is easy to use . There is also a built in memory card reader that can be used to print photographs directly from memory cards.As the packaging indicates , a USB cable is not included , but that is not an issue if you set it up as a wireless printer like I did . Since the set up guide is easy to follow , set up was rather straight forward and I was up and running in approximately 15-20 minutes . The setup time included taking the machine out of the box , removing packing materials , installing the ink cartridges , installing the printer driver/software and connecting it to my wireless network.Once set up , you can print and scan wirelessly . There is also an option for mobile/cloud printing , but I did not set this up . The scan quality was fine , and speed was about what I expected since it is not meant to be a high speed scanner . As for print quality , this printer is perfectly fine for printing basic color and/or black-and-white documents . With that being said , this should not be confused for a photo printer . I would n't say that the photos came out terribly ( theylooked fine ) , but this is not the printer for someone looking for a professional photo printer.Overall , this printer is perfectly fine for light and general home usage .	1
The Epson XP-400 is a small personal printer with built-in wi-fi , scanning , and printing and copying features . It is easy to install and setup and is suitable for personal use , college dorm , and those who do not wish to make a large volume of prints , however , want a reliable and easy-to-use machine.My first impression is that the XP-400 is a light and compact machine . Setup involved installing the 4 ink cartridges , running the cd and updating some drivers . Printing involved hooking up an usb cable , and selecting print . This is by far one of the least complicated printer models on the market.I did have some trouble with the scanner driver not initially being recognized , however Epson included a wizard which helped me resolve the conflict . Printing did not initially work , as it refused to recognize the paper in the tray . This was resolved after I rebooted it . I test printed several pages and found the quality was good but not the best inkjet printing I have seen . There was no usb cable included with my printer.Pros : Setup was easy . * Scanner is built in , so no need to mess with software to use* Printing is easy via usb* Software install* Light weight* Not a lot of unnecessary featuresCons : * No usb cable* Was n't able to find the scanner driver with default install , however built-in wizard corrected the problem* Scanning takes up to 2 minutes* Initially kept throwing error there was no paper in paper tray . This was resolved after restart . * Black ink cartridge same size as colorVerdict : decent printer , midrange printer quality , easy to use and setup . A decent solid entry by Epson .	1
I was n't expecting much out of the small Epson Expression Home XP-400 Wireless All-in-One , but I sure am glad it showed itself as a worthy little workhorse . It has all the features the average user will need rolled into one , Print , Scan , and Copy . What this Epson printer lacks is bulk and footprint , but what is n't missing is performance . The scanner on it is fast and accurate , great for copying various paper documents . The Epson XP-400 also prints quickly and quietly , and while it is n't the ultimate speed-demon , it is still pretty quick . I was suprised with the quietness of the unit , and what sounds it does make do n't make you think it 's about to clunk and clatter itself to pieces . One thing worth criticizing , and I 've found this true among all of the Epson printer 's I 've used , is that the draft print mode is practically useless . Draft mode prints so light it leaves missing lines , some lines darker than others , some lines so light they can barely be seen . Saving ink is not worth the illegibility of draft-mode print-outs . Really that 's the only downside to this unit , and really it 's a minor quibble at best . Overall this little wireless Epson all-in-one is a good value and decent performer .	1
I 've used a few Epson printers the past few years , and this like the rest does n't disappoint . It 's a humble printer , devoid of some of the features others may offer , such as fax , built in duplexing , or photo quality printing , but it prints well , has inputs for SD cards , and is easy to set up ( no need for USB cable ) . Wireless works great , even wireless scanning , and scanning to jpg or pdf is a nice option as well . I 've used it on PCs and Macs , and everything works well.As stated before , there 's no need for the USB cable which traditionally , almost out of spite , never comes with a printer ( did used to come with scanners ) , so this is n't a ( unique ) negative.The lack of current Mac support out of the box was a pain , but alas like the above , it 's not unique.It will suck up ink , as the EPSON method of separating print heads and ink leaves lines that need filled , and even the full cartridges you start with die quickly . New ones will last longer , but they are n't cheap.All in all a very good printer , and one I recommend , as long as you 're not looking for the most advanced printer	1
When UPS delivered a box to me yesterday I wondered what it was because it was too light to be the printer I was expecting . Yes , it did turn out to be the Epson XP-400 All-in-One inkjet I had been waiting for . I did n't know if this relatively light box was a good thing or not , because it started me wondering what they had left off this all-in-one that my HP Officejet had on it that I really could n't do without.It was extremely well packaged but took only a minute to get it completely plugged up and ready to install . I sat it in a very small space on my desk , since the printer only measures about 12 inches by 15 inches , even with the paper feed slot opened . What a difference between that and my Big and Heavy HP . It did n't take more than five minutes to put in the disc provided and update my firmware , and to connect the printer to my wireless network . Very easy . If you ever have a problem loading a printer , youtube is always there to help you out . But really , this was a snap.I ran a few test pages of black print and they were nice and dark . Then I ran a full-size photo on regular copy paper . It started printing ... .and printing ... .and printing . Since I work out of a home office , when it seemed to be taking forever to advance , I went to the basement and took some wash out of the dryer and put some more wash in the washer . When I came upstairs , it was still printing . So I took the wash upstairs to the linen closet and came back . It was just about finished . I should have timed it , but maybe that gives you an idea of how long color printing takes . A long time . But the color was good . I did n't gasp in amazed delight over it , thought it had a tad too much yellow compared to the screen image , but you know how that goes . The next picture I ran smaller on photo paper and it was good . Ran faster , of course , and the finished product was as good as any inkjet not specifically for photos that I have had ... ..and I 've had quite a few.The cartridges seem to be holding up well . There is a function on the printer screen for checking ink levels whenever you like , not just when they are running low . Replacement cartridges are reasonably priced ( that 's usually where these low-priced printers get you , is in the after-sale of ink . ) I can see this being a great printer for my small office . I do a lot of color printing and even if it takes a bit longer with this Epson , the overall result and cost will make it worth it . Think of all the wash I 'll get done during working hours.Update : I have been running a lot of colored copies in the last few days and have never had a repeat of the very long running time that I experienced at first . I can only think the machine was working out the kinks or something . Much , much faster now - comparable to most of the other printers I 've had . Only negative so far is some slight banding on standard copy paper that I do n't see on the photo paper . But some of the prints have been rather outstanding , actually.Further update 10/04/12 : Wish I did n't have to make this particular update , but if I were considering buying the XP-400 printer I would want to know . It may be just this single unit that is doing it , so read other reviews and see if it is a common problem before you decide not to buy . I have n't used the printer an excessive amount . Normally my printers get much more use than I have put on this one . But already I am getting blurry roller lines on my work . I do n't know a cure for that other than having the rollers replaced , which of course is n't worth it in a printer in this price range . So the Epson XP will be replaced a lot sooner than I had planned .	1
This is a pretty awesome printer for the money ( $ 70 at the time of writing ) . It offers a wide range of features and seems to be pretty user friendly . Let me spell out the pros and cons below : Pros : * Installation was easy on my Mac Mini . A few other people had noted that the included installation CD was not compatible with Mac OS Mountain Lion , so I just went straight to the Epson website and installed the proper drivers . Worked like a charm . * The other features are user-friendly , too . The LED screen works well and is easy to use . Compared with other printers , it was really easy to connect my wireless internet : you just enter the password on the LED screen and everything is good to go . * The ink cartridges are relatively cheap for an inkjet printer of this kind . * The color is pretty good compared to other inkjets I 've used . * The scanner and copier work well.Cons : * Even though ink cartridges are relatively cheap for an inkjet , it 's STILL an inkjet . Compared to my laser printer , it eats through ink really fast and is not ideal for big printing jobs like I usually need ( printing large files of all text ) . * The copier does not have a feeder tray , so you have to do one page at a time.Overall , though , I 'm very impressed with this printer , especially for the great price currently available . Four stars only because of the two problems described above . Otherwise I would give it 5 .	1
I got this printer for my daughter to take to college and so far it seems great . I gave it four stars because it 's only been in use for a week and I 'll update to see if it lasts.It 's super easy to use right out of the box ; it comes with a quick start guide which shows how to set it up on 5 or 6 easy steps or so . The unit itself is fairly light and compact , perfect for a crowded dorm or apartment.My daughter has a Mac Airbook and could easily set up the printer by choosing Epson and then the Mac automatically installed the drivers . The 4 cartridges that came with the printer were super small so I anticipate this being costly to run as she 'll run out of ink fast , but I try to use generic cartridges for replacement.After turning the unit on , putting cartridges in and having the unit do a self-test , it was ready to go.There is no printer usb cord included so we purchased one in case wifi goes down . The pages print clean and ink looks bright . Thrilled to have all-in-one functionality in such a small package .	1
This Epson Expression Home XP-400 printer is great if you have a lack of space for a huge printer . It is compact.I have little room at my desk , but with this printer I managed to gain space rather than lose even more . I love that . The footprint is truly what makes this printer so desirable for me . Furthermore , despite the small size , it 's a competent printer . I can scan and printer wirelessly from my computers . Brilliant . Furthermore , making a quick copy of a receipt for a rebate or car maintenance binder is a snap too . It 's funny how once you have an all in one device like this in your home , you find so many uses for it . Printing , copying , and scanning is quick , simple , and easy.The use of 3 color cartridges plus 1 black cartridge is ideal . With this setup , you replace only the inks you use most often . If you search Amazon , you can sometimes find some nice deals on cartridges as well . Personally , I find I replace my blacks more often as I do not print too many photos , except perhaps that one time each year when you get home from a big vacation . Whatever your needs though , this printer will likely satisfy it . Epson 's Artisan line of printers are better for the very best picture quality , but this Expression Home line is better at sharp text and is still competent for some quick hobby photos too.The one thing lacking by this model is fax compatibility . However , if you do n't need to fax , why pay for fax function . If you do need to fax , better off getting a model that does support fax than regret it later.You can forget needing a USB cable with the printer too . It features wireless networking built in , so print or scan , wirelessly . This sure replaced the days of dreading the fact printers did n't include a USB cable . You simply do not need one now.Overall , this is a great printer if you 're tight on space . With its small footprint , it makes a great second printer for the house too . Recommended .	1
I 've been using this printer for several off-site group meetings , and it had been great so far . It is small and light , thus easy to carry , it prints in reasonable speed ( do not expect laser level performance , though ) , and the ink cost is acceptable.The setup was a pleasant experience . The on device WiFi setup was a breeze , but Windows part required a disc to pair ( there is a download on Epson site was well , but Windows Update can not discover it automatically on the network ) . It can be setup for Google Cloud Print though , which means you can print from Chrome on your laptop ( or mobile device ) without need for any drivers . After my last two printers , I changed my mind about WiFi being a useless feature , but actually being a very important one . ( It can also scan remotely , or access the media card as a Windows network share over WiFi ) .And the device is small , but packs a lot of good features , while omitting some . While it has basic printing , scanning , and media card photo functions , it does not contain much extras . For example , there is no input tray , but only manual feed . There is no fax capability . There is no automatic document feeder for the scanner . And while the LCD screen is nice , it is actually not touch screen ( the `` touch controls '' is misleading , basically there are usual touch buttons beside the screen ) .I was able to print around 200 brochures with the supplied ink . The good thing is , you can change ink cartridges one by one ( mine was heavy on the blue , so I only needed to change Cyan and Magenta first ) . And if you run out of color , the printer asks you to continue in B & W . ; Even though they sell individual cartridges , I 'd recommend buying themas the color multi pack . Thus given my usage , and today 's ink prices , the cost for one color page is around $ 0.18 , and one B & W ; page is around $ 0.06.Overall I liked the printer , and will continue to use it for off site needs . ( It can also be useful for people who need a small printer at home due to space restrictions , but that 's not the case for me ) . However if you need a dedicated printer , print a lot , and you can buy a larger one , make your initial investment at a higher class one , and you can save on ink costs in the long run .	1
I could n't pass up this price . Almost a giveaway . It was easy to wirelessly install and started printing right on target . I have trouble with MY internet printing . It comes out so small I ca n't read it , so I have to paste whatever I want to print on my word processing program . I do n't know if it is my browser 's problem ( Mac ) or the problem of the printer . Easy to install updates from the internet .	1
This is one of Epson 's budget home printers , but I am surprised at how many great features it has ! The list includes wireless printing , scanning , copying , as well as an SD/memory card slot and a pop-up , LCD , touch screen front control panel.Upon unboxing , you will see that this is a small printer . The dimensions closed are 15.25 '' wide x 5.50 '' tall x 12 '' deep . With paper loaded in the back and the paper tray extended in the front , the dimensions are 15.25 '' wide x 12 '' tall x 17.50 '' deep.Be sure and take all of the packing tape and foam off and out of the printer before using . Epson suggests having a USB printer cable ( NOT included ) available for printer setup , even if you will be using this printer wirelessly . I have set up several Epson wireless printers and have never needed a USB cable . Here are the steps I use for an easy , trouble-free installation.On your computer , go to Epson dot com and under support and drivers , enter XP-400 and download the combo software driver package . Even though a CD with the drivers comes included , they are invariably outdated so get the latest ones from Epson . While you are at it , bookmark ( and later print ) the full User 's Guide at Epson . It contains much more information than the printed Quick Guide that is included in the box.While it is downloading , power on your printer . It will direct you to install the ink cartridges ( included ) . Then , on the LCD touchscreen , select wifi setup . You will need to know the name of your wireless network ( SSID ) and the password , if any . Once this setup is complete , it will offer to print a wifi confirmation test page , so load some paper if you wish to do this.Now go to your computer and install the software and drivers you just downloaded . When it asks , select `` this printer is already connected to my wireless network '' and continue with the installation . When it finishes , including any firmware upgrades , you 're ready to print ! By the way , if there are several computers in your home , you must install the combo software drivers package on EVERY computer that wishes to print to this printer.Note : if you print the initial test pages during installation , you will notice it is excruciatingly slow . Do n't worry - after installation is complete , printing , scanning and copying is much speedier.Text is crisp and clear and color printing is vibrant . You will get the best results using premium inkjet paper or premium photo paper , but text documents are quite acceptable on plain , old copy paper . Photos on photo paper are pretty darn good ! Not photo lab quality , but you could certainly frame a print for your desk and not be unhappy with the quality.Scanning in professional mode produces excellent scans ! The Epson scanning software offers many options to suit your needs and is relatively easy to figure out even without reading the user 's manual.The SD/memory card slot on the front of the printer lets you print without even turning on your computer ! You can even print a preview sheet of all the photos on the SD card from your digital camera.A nice surprise is that this printer features Air Print , Epson Connect and Google cloud printing ! Air Print means that for me , I can print from my iPhone , iPad or iPod without any additional setup ! Epson connect lets you print remotely from anywhere you are . Google cloud printing lets android users print wirelessly from their phones and other devices and even lets you share your printer with others.I 'm very surprised at how many features this printer has . Because it 's a budget printer , there is no paper tray and it does n't have fax capabilities and it 's not as speedy as the Epson WorkForce line . But I can definitely recommend it for home use at a very affordable price .	1
This Epson All-in-one is a wonderful little work horse . The print quality is right up there with other companies if not better . The scanning quality is perfect and copies come out clear and crisp.It 's size is quite pleasing as it 's a bit smaller than some others but I just wish it was constructed just a wee bit better . If it 's looks you want then go somewhere else but just remember good things come in small packages.My only real con to this whole thing is the seperate small ink cartridges . I think the are annoying to say the least but hey I 'm lazy . I rather like the old ink cartridges that were a decent size and would go on forever . Yah it probably makes sense to have them smaller and individual but we all have our own preferences . I do n't do alot of photos so this is most likely the reason I like the larger cartridges better.This product is so easy to set up and get her going it 's not funny . The easiest I 've had to date . The LCD screen is a blessing and quite a nifty feature that I could get spoiled with . I 've done everything on this but fax which I will probably never use but it is nice to have it should the need come up.Overall , this is a dandy must have for your home or office . Does everything you need and does it well and that 's what is most important . Epsom has come up in the world over the years and I 'm happy to see the quality is much better now that many years ago . It 's a name that will stick around for some time to come .	1
I purchased this printer for a friend of mine to replace his older Epson MFP . The only complaint I have is that his computer is an older Dell laptop model 1501 with only 1gb of memory . It took forever to download the driver due to the speed and power of the computer . I can not really fault the printer for this , but think that others might want to know about this issue prior to purchasing . The print speed is much faster than the older Epson printer had . The ink cartridges appear to be the same , so that was a deciding factor on buying this model printer . Once setup this Epson printer is very nice , especially for the price .	1
The wireless Epson , Expression Home XP-400 Small-in-One Printer prints , copies and scans.Following the easy instructions , I was printing documents within 20 minutes after I opened the box.For me , the most amazing aspect of this device is the free software that allows me to print remotely from anywhere in my home.I was looking for a printer that looks nice , was easy to setup and would provide efficient wireless printing from my lap top in my living room . This product fit the bill perfectly.This is not a heavy duty machine with massive paper capacity , but that is not what I wanted . It is a color ink jet printer that holds about 30 pieces of paper , but it is built to perform.It prints 8.7 black and white or 4.5 color pages per minute . The print resolution is up to 5760 by 1440 dpi while the Scan Resolution is up to 2400 high-quality dpi.It uses instant-dry ink and has the Epson Connecting software to instantly print wireless from computers and mobile phone devices.The easy to follow setup and product instructions are clear and easy to follow.Whether printing a word , excel , access , power point , photo or internet document this printer prints crisp smudge free and water resistant documents.I find the 2.5 LCD touch panel easy to use and like the PC-free printing with built-in card slots.Designed for simplicity , the affordable individual ink cartridges are easy to install and the product is very easy to use.This is an awesome , affordable product that is exactly what I was looking for.I hope you are as happy with it as I am.Enjoy !	1
This may very well be the perfect wireless color inkjet printer . Small footprint , great print quality , low cost , inexpensive ink and easy to set up may make this the best printer in it 's class . Not a photo quality printer but prints images in more than acceptable quality . Wireless printing works flawlessly when hooked up to my wireless router . Can print from any PC logged into the network as well as my iPhone and iPad . If you are looking for a small inexpensive wireless capable color printer , you just found it ! Buy it !	1
In years past , whenever I 've purchased a `` compact '' all-in-one , it still felt like it weighed 30+ lbs and had a large enough footprint I would n't consider it `` compact '' . This is the first printer I 've had that is what I 've always thought a simple compact all-in-one should be . The footprint really is small . It really does weigh less than 10 lbs . The printing really is quiet . The printer I used previously would always begin a printing job with click-clacking sounds preparing the print heads , etc . There are no preparatory/ending clicking noises with the XP-400 - the first sound I hear is the machine grabbing the paper to print on and the last noise I hear is the paper being spit out . I often find myself printing at odd hours of the night and sounds in the house really echo so I would always fret I would wake up other members of the house with the old printer . I feel much better using this machine.Standard printing quality is more grainy than my old , bigger printer , but it 's not a problem for everyday printing or printing coupons . And when I do need a high-quality picture , printing on `` best photo '' option has provided good enough quality for me - I did n't think there were any noticeable pixels/streaks in the picture unless you 're fixating on the image specifically to find those details.This is a great go-to for anyone that wants a small , light , quiet , working home all-in-one . It has lived up well to my expectations and I am very happy with it .	1
This was my first time using a Epson printer . Owned many printers of other makers , but never an Epson . And I was not disappointed.First off , make sure you read the item description as it is NOT a fax machine . These days many devices like this are also a fax machine and people get the machine and are disappointed.Also this is mainly set up as a wireless machine . So there is NO USB cable included . However you can set it up and use it via USB , but you must provide the USB cable.However if you are looking for a good color printer , copier , then this is the one.Very easy to set up . Once it is set up , you can print from just about any wireless device . I 've printed from a Droid phone , iPad , PC , and a iPhone.It comes with starter ink . Ink is expensive no matter what printer you use . So if you print a lot , well ink will be a lot.Printing photos is not the best . It will print them , but if you want good quality photos , you want a more expensive printer.But for most people , printing a page or making a copy of something , then this printer is great.One thing I find interesting is that the machine tends to `` shoot '' pages out the front , instead of laying them after printing . I do NOT consider this a problem . Just something interesting as we have a parrot who is fascinated with the `` flying paper '' from the black machine . If he is out of his cage and around the printer , he hears it and will fly and try and catch the paper . Fun to watch but if he gets the paper then it 's torn etc . He looks at me like to say `` why are you not helping me get the paper ? `` In the end , this is a good printer . Keep in mind it 's not a $ 400 printer.It 's a good wireless printer that allows you to print from numerous wireless enabled devices .	1
I have owned many Epsons including the 17x22 large format . There is a rule - the more you spend the cheaper the per page the printer is to use . This printer has a wonderful set of features for the price . It needs to be used by someone who not for any volume printing but more towards a more occasional use for an individual . Keeping that in mind it is a real prize . It is just amazing what one gets for their money these days . Just 15 years ago this would have been whole lot more .	1
The Canon Pixma MG4220 is one of the few printers on the market that supports Apple AirPrint and Google Cloud Print ( GCP ) , so that print jobs can be initiated wirelessly not only from a computer , but also from a smartphone or a tablet . Because this kind of printer is now an Internet device , you can take a picture in Paris at this moment , thousands of miles from home , and show it to your family in the States by having it printed out right from the home printer ! For the past two months , I have been using a special kind of computer called the Samsung ChromeboxSamsung Series 3 Chromebox , which runs Google 's Chrome OS . It can boot up to the log-in screen in 8 seconds and shut down in one second . It 's the kind of computer that is both inexpensive ( about $ 330 , or $ 500 , including computer , 23-inch monitor , and keyboard/mouse ) to buy and easy to use , especially for older folks and very young kids . This computer requires a printer like the Canon Pixma MG4220 that supports Google Cloud Print . It works simply and beautifully.IMO , Canon makes the best scanner software for its multi-function printers . It is easy to use , and the function I like most is its ability to scan multiple pages as one PDF file , which I can then send as an attachment in an email.I do not use the copy function , because it is more cost-effective to use a laser copier . This function is reserved for emergency use only , when I need a quick copy.In the long run , the most expensive part of an inkjet printer is the ink cartridge . Of course the original manufacturer makes cartridges that turn out the best looking prints , but a couple of them can easily cost more than the printer itself , so I usually buy refills or refill the cartridges myself . Costco can also refill a cartridge for you at prices from $ 8 to $ 10 , but you need to make sure Costco can service this particular model 's cartridge .	1
This is hands down the easiest printer I have ever set up . It was about 10 minutes from start to finish . No cd 's or downloads from the internet . ( That i could tell ) I can print from my iphone too . Thats useful if theres a document id rather print than read on my phone . I 'm not sure how useful that feature will be but maybe some people cary valuable docs with em on their iphone or iPad , but at any rate its an added feature that i had never been able to use before . It also crams a pretty good scanner in there too . All of this and like I said 10 minutes of setup . ( I 'm pretty sure the scanning feature downloaded drivers in the background . ) My gf was able to print in a bout 2 minutes with her Mac Book too.It has a copy feature on there as well . Which brings me to the biggest downside . Ink prices . We burned through an ink cartridge pretty quick test printing photos . They came out gorgeous on photo paper , but on highest resolution we got maybe 50 full size images done before the ink started to go . And they run anywhere from $ 20-50Canon Office Products PG-240XL/CL-241XL/PP-201 - Combo Pack InkSo i dont think it would be very effective to use as a copy machine . Also double check the dimensions.All in all Its one of the easiest , best looking printers ive used both in terms in looks and results , with the same downside as just about any inkjet printer . If desk space is n't at a premium , and you dont mind paying for cartridges , this is an excellent choice .	1
I really love everything about this printer besides the price of ink . For this reason , I suggest you purchaseCanon PG-240XXL Office Products FINE Cartridge InkoverCanon PG-240XL Office Products FINE Cartridge Inkbecause there is much more ink in it making it a much better deal . The cartridges that come in the printer do n't last long at all , so you should probably go ahead and order extra ink with the printer . This is the only negative about the printer , so now I will explain what I like about it.The set up of this printer was extremely easy on both of our laptops . My husband had no issues at all and we actually have 2 wireless printers connected to both now . It 's wireless , which is always a nice thing . I love that I can print from my iPad or iphone as well . It makes it so much more convenient for us , because we used to have to get off the iPad or iPhone and get on the laptop to print since our old printer was n't compatible . The quality of the prints that it produces is better than I 've ever seen from any of my previous printers . I also love that it opens at the top like a commercial printer , so I can lift the lid and put whatever I want copied face down and just push print . I can even pick color or black and white , which saves ink too . This printer is pretty compact as well for all it 's capable of . It is my favorite printer that I 've ever owned and I highly recommend this to anyone if you can look past the cost of ink . I figure that it will eventually go down or someone will make a generic brand that is more affordable , as the printer gets older . The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of the ink , other than that , it 's 5 stars to me .	1
I love my new Canon PIXMA MG4220 wireless printer . I was so tired of having to email myself documents so that I could print them from our main computer at home . I can now use my laptop or Ipad to print from anywhere in the house . Set up was very , very easy . I just loaded the disk in our main computer , and the software downloaded . I registered the printer online and it was ready to go . To set up from my laptop I just went to `` printer '' on my computer and it found it on my network and it was instantly ready to print . I wish I would have known how easy it was , I would have purchased one sooner ! The only thing I do n't like about this printer is that it makes a lot of `` banging '' noises when it prints . The noise is not very loud during the day , but if you want to print late at night or early morning when people are sleeping , it might wake them up if the printer is in a room nearby .	1
This is a very nice compact printer , it folds up for easy storage and and does not take up much room on a counter . It is pretty simple and works like a normal printer , it offers a nice scan bed ( with the top door being able to raise a little bit to support books and larger items and still have a white background ) . It has a little LCD screen , and simple menus , it has a slot for SD and Memory Stick Duo cards ( mostly Sony products ) . It can scan and copy from the printer ( I normally use the scan function from my computer and not the one on the scanner ) . It only uses two ink cartridges ( which is shocking for a photo printer ) .Installation was very simple and I was able to just use the Nearby Printers on my Mac and it was added instantly and ready to go ( I guess the Mac already had the drivers for it or they were super small , since it did not take anytime ! I was also able to detect the Printer from my iPhone ( AirPrint ) . On my Mac and iPhone have Double Sided printing , and it automatically can do both sides.This printer prints great pages and they look sharp and clean , it provides the same great printing that my large HP OfficeJet offers . However , this printer excels with Photo Printing ! I put in some HP 4x6 Photo Paper and sent a print job ( Borderless 4x6 ) and it looked great there was no smearing or anything , right out of the printer you could run your finger across it and not smear it . It does take it some time to print ( about 2 minutes for my borderless 4x6 print ) , but for these results I can wait ! They were very sharp and looked great ! The only changes I would make to this printer ( if I could ) , is a better user interaction ( the wording on the LCD screen could be tweaked a little and the button layout should be adjusted , since it is sometimes confusing ) . I would also have liked to have two trays , one for photo paper , and one for regular paper , so you could print to photo or letter without having to change the paper , since it excels at Photo Printing I am using my OfficeJet for Letter size and put 4x6 Photo Paper in this guy ! In the end this is a great printer , it communicated with my Mac and iPhone excellently ( did not even use the CD ) , it offers all the features you probably need for basic printing and offers a great photo ! There are a few tweaks I would of have liked to see , however , it is super small and can be folded up to take up no room ! I am happy with this printer and am enjoying it . My usual problem with printers is ink consumption and I will see how long these cartridges last ! But for now , it is perfect , small and provides an excellent Photo Printer !	1
The Canon Pixma MG4220 is an amazing printer . To have the capability to print from my phone and my iPad , is the best ! ! ! It was very easy to set up . Actually there was virtually no installation at all . We just had to connect via Bluetooth and we were ready to go . The picture quality is the best I 've seen so far . This one has an LCD screen that makes it simple to go through the menus . There is also an SD card slot where you can download pictures directly to the printer . I highly recommend this printer as your go to for all of your home office needs .	1
Today , I set up my new Canon Pixma MG4220 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier.The installation went smoothly , although the instructions and diagrams could have been a bit easier to read and understand . It pays to take your time when setting up the printer , since the parts are made of flimsy plastic and you do not want to break a part inadvertently . On the plus side , the paper loads easily in the front and you need only two ink cartridges , one black and one color . The quality of the printing is very good -- crisp , clear , with bright , true-to-life colors.On the other hand , this printer is noisy both while printing and after the job is done . I suppose I will get used to this , but it is a bit irritating . Please be aware that this printer does not have FAX capability . It does two-sided printing with ease , which is a useful feature.As I get to know my Canon a bit better , I will have a broader picture of its capabilities , but so far , it seems like a good basic printer that can print both wirelessly or with a USB cable ( which you must buy separately . )	1
I ordered this printer solely to be able to print from an iPad . My wife and I recently acquired iPads ( she has a 4 , I have a mini ) and our home printer -- although a Canon wireless -- would not print from those devices . I had downloaded a couple of apps from the Apple store that would supposedly recognize the older printer ( one free , one $ 9.99 ) , and I was finally able to get it to print photos but not text ... so I ordered this PIXMA MG4220 because it was an Airprint printer and was iPad compatible . Set up was completely idiot-proof ( which it had to be since I am technologically-challenged ) with step-by-step written instructions . The printer comes with a CD for use with a PC if you 're going to use it with a laptop or desktop , but I was n't ... so you will NOT need the CD if you 're only planning to use an iPad . The printer comes with a & # 34 ; starter kit & # 34 ; of black and color print cartridges , but expect these not to last very long , so I 'd recommend ordering additional cartridges when purchasing this printer.The printer instantly recognized my wireless router after I powered the printer up , and I followed simple instructions that appeared on the small screen that is a part of the printer ... and that was it ! It prints perfectly from both of the iPads we have , both photos and text ... .I stored the included CD software for potential later use with my laptop if I decide to use the MG4220 with my PC.Seriously , this printer is a breeze to set up . I only intend it for light use at my home because the per print cost is probably fairly high due to the type of printer it is , but I think it will perfectly suit my needs . I 'd certainly buy it again .	1
I have had several Canon printers over the last few years and really needed a wireless printer for some of my devices . The Canon PIXMA is perfect . Beautiful color pictures , sharp and clear documents and the scanner does a great job . It is hard to imagine that a printer with all of these capabilities was not even available a few years ago and now at this price ? Wow . I am still a Canon printer and camera user and have found no reason to change . I have already recommended this printer to several friends and I know of at least one who has purchased one . She is also very happy with it .	1
This printer is great . Wireless setup is fast and painless , the supplies are relatively cheap , and the print quality is great . NOT photo quality but very , very good for general use .	1
Hello , My Name is Maximum Verbosity and I am a Printer Geek.I love electronics and gadgets . LOVE 'em . Any opportunity I have to try out a new gadget or anything that does something for me , I 'm excited . This includes anything from a new tablet computer to a vacuum cleaner . I should have been born into a REAL Jetson 's World . Rosie and I would have been BFF 's for sure.So I was very happy to try out the newCanon PIXMA MG4220 Wireless Color Photo Printer with Scanner and Copier . I had been eyeing it at my nearby Target for a couple of weeks . I am upgrading from anHewlett Packard 3050A Wireless All-in-One Color Photo Printerwhich is also a pretty good little machine . Except only one person on our network was ever able to use it wirelessly , which took away the convenience . It was also impossible ( for me and my very tech savvy son ) to get it to connect to Google Cloud Print . We followed the directions tirelessly to no avail.Anyway , back to the Canon . First of all , it is much more compact than my other printers . It fits perfectly on the 12 inch wide shelf I have it sitting on . The front tray folds in and out neatly and has all sorts of parts that slide around depending on what size/type paper you are using . It was VERY easy to set up , physically . Basically plug it in and turn it on . I had no problem getting it to set up with Google Cloud print , it took seconds ( once I got the wireless to actually work - more on that below ) to print something from my Nexus 7 tablet , very cool.Now for the bummer part . I followed the directions to set it up to use wirelessly on our home network but it was asking me to physically carry it downstairs to the room that has the router and push a button on the router while pushing one on the printer . That was very awkward and silly . Wireless is wireless - every other wireless device in this house ( laptops , desktops , phones , ipods , tablets , e-readers , wifi camera cards , etc ) connect from wherever the person using them is sitting . So , I dutifully did what was ask and it kept asking me for some sort of WLAN code , which none of my other devices have requested . Usually I just have to have the network info , passwords/keys and I 'm all set . I was even able to get my CAR hooked up to our network with less effort and I certainly could n't have driven it into the house to push a button on it and the router at the same time ! Following the directions did n't work , it kept asking for the WLAN code , then saying the network was offline ( while all of the other devices , including our cable TV 's , were all working fine on the network ) , then saying the printer was turned off when it obviously was n't , etc . My son reset it a couple of times and finally I was able to get it to see my network , get my laptop to see the printer and everyone was friends . We added my tablet computer , a few other laptops in the house and were good to go ( I did n't want everyone to be able to print to this printer , just the older kids and the adults . No sense in using up expensive ink cartridges for 45 photos of Hannah Montana ) . Then , when I REALLY needed to print something to take with me for a business deal I was working on , it refused to print . It just sat in the `` loading ... .loading ... .loading '' stage and would n't work . Running the trouble shooter on my laptop told me that the printer was turned off ( while the lights were brightly blinking right in front of me ) . So , I had to go back to connect with a cord on my HP to get the stuff printed . We 've had the printer for 2 weeks now and for the last several days , are unable to get it to print wirelessly , pretty disappointing.I like that the paper tray is in the front of the printer , my old printers always have it on the top which means the paper is usually curled due to the shelf above it being too low . The front loading tray also makes it easy to print double sided to save on paper.PROS : -Quick & Easy Set-up-Easy to read Menu Screen-SD slot in the front for scanning things right on to SD , as well as scanning to another device-Compact size-Paper tray is in the front - great space saver-Lots of menu choices for ink use , cleaning , turning the printer on/off wirelessly , quiet mode , etc.-quiet and fairly quick to print in draft mode-bright , clear photos when printed on photo paper-ink cartridges are about the same as other printers ( too darn much ! ) .-did n't have to download a bunch of drivers , software , etc . to use it . Just plug & useCONS : -ink cartridge refills are expensive . Seriously , it costs more than a gallon of gas to fill an ink cartridge in ANY printer and most of them wo n't allow refills ( Lexmark being the WORST ) -Difficulty getting it to stay connected to our network . I suspect Google Cloud might be at play.-tends to go through a routine of a bunch of clicking and resetting noises after printing a document , which lengthens the time between printing documents.Would I get this printer again ? Absolutely . I feel ( currently ) confident that I can work out the issues with the network and get it working wirelessly again . Other than that , it 's a great printer that scans , prints and makes copies that are nearly as good as the expensive laser printers at my husband 's company ( to be fair , they use expensive paper there , where I use cheap recycled stuff ) .Canon has always been a good brand for me . I 've always been a fan of their products ( had many a Canon camera in my life ) and feel pretty confident that this printer will hold up to Canon 's reputation for quality products . *Will update as the wireless issue resolves itself .	1
One of the best thing about the printer is that if you have a wireless network you do n't need a usb cable to install , and once you have it setup in your network ( which you can do straight on the mini display / interface on the printer itself ) you can print from a tablet ( iPad ) or other mobile devices without having to install anything.The printer was a little louder than expected , but does provide a quiet mode . Loading the paper sticks out in front , towards you ( horizontally as opposed to vertically like a lot of compact printers ) .The disk to install the software in the computer comes packaged with a lot of what I like to term junk , but some other people might like it . It comes with like 1 GB worth of different small programs to edit images , and who knows what else . During install you have to manually uncheck all the extra software , because it will just load it all by default.I did a few print tests , and while photo printing ( on photo paper ) was great , text printing on regular white paper shows just tiny little bit of bleeding , and you can clearly tell a paper printed by laser printer ( super sharp ) to this one.In summary : Pros : - Super easy , no software to install to print from an iPad- No disk needed or cables needed to install in a wireless network- Photo printing is very good*- Relatively fastNeutral- Cartridge install seems a little forced ( it snaps harder than most other printers I have bought.- Paper sticks out in front ( so the printed paper comes out on top of the white paper ( granted there is a divider , but still worth noting ) - Lengthy software included ( like 8 different products ) and most are checked to be installed by default . Keeping this neutral as some people might want the software , but I felt it was mostly useless.Cons- Ink bleeds a little in regular white paper- Not nearly as sharp as laser ( to be expected I know , but maybe I was hoping inkjet quality had increased to be more up to par ) * As a side note , it is cheaper to print your pictures through any of the big shops than it is to do it on your own printer . The cost of ink and photo paper is much higher for home users .	1
I have used HP & Lexmark printers.. along with Xerox Solid Ink ( the best ) . I also tried a couple of Kodak wifi printers within the past couple of years . But , the Canon has impressed me so much that the other printers in my house have been donated . The Canon effortlessly connected to my wireless router ( yeah ! ) I was downstairs and wanted to print something that I pulled up on my iPad , and realized that this printer was capable . All I did was select `` print '' , it found the printer , and PRESTO ! I heard the printer printing upstairs . I 'm so impressed with the ease of use and the fact that the printer actually works as advertised . Wifi- perfect , iPad printing - perfect . Print quality - excellent . No paper jams yet !	1
I 'm a big fan of Canon , as my cameras and scanner will attest . Canon knows imaging . This printer offers some very attractive features at a relatively low price , but needs a bit of polish in spots.Wireless setup was quite easy , even with my more clamped-down network . I do n't broadcast an SSID , but using the printer 's display and keypad I was able to enter SSID and security information . Never touched the USB cable . The printer immediately found my network and the Mac ( using Bonjour ) found it . There 's some potential confusion -- Canon provides a downloadable driver , and Bonjour provides an automatic generic connection . It will appear as if there are two different printers there . The Canon driver provided access to more features , so I went with it . Airprint worked nicely from my iPad . There are only a few applications that currently support it , but it was simplicity itself to print directly from Safari.Printing of generic text documents is reasonably speedy , with text and illustrations coming through with acceptable sharpness . Basic home and ( very small ) office needs can be well-served . Scanning is n't bad ; it 's certainly not as sharp or saturated as the Canon 9000 around the corner , but it 's perfectly good for the casual needs of most users.Photographic printing is where a few issues crop up . In fairness I should say that I have n't been able to test with Canon papers ( do n't have any ) , so I used premium quality Epson paper . That 's likely to cause minor differences in color cast , but it does n't account for everything I saw . The Canon had the most difficulty with sky colors in outdoor shots . Colors were tilted strongly toward cyan and gradients turned a little blotchy . This is where a four-color printer has trouble keeping up with a higher-end photo printer . I have an Epson R800 -- a middle-quality 8-color photo printer -- and the Canon just ca n't hold a candle to it . Most casual users wo n't notice and will be pretty happy with the result , especially if they spend a little time learning to manage the printer 's color correctionBut there do appear to be firmware issues to resolve . After getting a few nice test prints out , I began to get blotchy cartoonish images . As I experimented with the various color modes , I managed to trigger a situation the printer has n't recovered from . Images were barely recognizable and were covered with very wet ink spots . Text printing was fine -- no sign of clogged heads -- but at this writing I have n't been able to return the printer to the quality images I got originally . Using the same presets with the same photographs now gives much different results . I do hope a resolution is coming along shortly and I 'll be happy to update this review at that time.The printer comes with some additional software for running the scanner , minor image manipulation , frame-grabbing and such . As I have better tools for those things , I did n't spend any time evaluating the software . On first glance it appears pretty generic . In summary it 's a nice combo printer/scanner . Canon does a pretty good job of updating firmware for their other products , and I 'd expect to see my quibbles addressed in due time .	1
I have a good photo printer ( HP Photosmart ) which has a dedicated photo paper drawer and separate CMYK ink cartridges , but it is not that good at printing labels . I do quite a bit of Ebay selling , and so I needed something that would handle cheap half-sheet label stock quickly and easily . For around a hundred bucks , this printer suits the job perfectly.After more than 50 labels through the printer , it has n't jammed or caught a curled edge even once , which is amazing considering I use the absolute cheapest labels I can find , and the corners are always curled.Printing is fast and the results are crisp , clear , and easy to read , even on economy settings.Wireless network setup took a few minutes , and has worked without a hitch on all three of my computers.Photo printing is expensive on this printer , but I was amazed at the quality results . The scanner works well , but my more expensive HP Photosmart scanner/printer had better clarity and color representation with my test photo.If you are looking for a basic home office inkjet printer that can handle all sorts of paper stock and give you quick and effortless results , this is a great option . If you are looking specifically for a photo printer , check out the higher end Canon or HP products that use 4 ink cartridges instead of just two , and that have a dedicated photo paper tray .	1
I set this up in our home office . I 'm grabbing the install disc and looking for a cable . My girlfriend : `` The website said no installation was needed ! '' Me : It 's not that easy . We need the CD . Her : '' No , we do n't . '' Darn . She was right . Install the ink , turn it on ( after removing about 3 feet of tape used to secure various parts and hatches ) , let it do it 's thing . On my Win 7 desktop , I added a new network printer - boom - there it was ( we use a wireless router and hub ) . Picked it , hit install . A minute later I was printing . From unboxing to print - five minutes . Seriously . Wow.Plus the print quality is fantastic . I 'll put it through it 's paces over the next few months - scanning , printing flyers , photos and the like . But so far I am really IMPRESSED !	1
I 'm very slow in writing this review for two reasons . First , the Post Office misplaced the package for nearly two weeks , which would have been heartbreaking because my old printer had just died ( an HP wireless ) and I desperately needed a new one . Second , I wanted to take some time and work with all of the features of the printer before rushing into a review . The long and short is that this is a superior printer in every way that I can ascertain . The only thing I am unsure about is what kind of life I will get out of the printer cartridges.Before proceeding I should add that I have two HP laptops and I had previously been unable to connect either of them to my HP wireless printer . I had called HP tech support and technicians kicked support up several levels . They were briefly able to get one of the laptops to work with the printer , but after the software automatically updated it ceased . For the life of the printer I had to print everything via USB cable.The contrast with the set up of this Canon PIXMA printer could n't have been greater . Not only did it work with each printer , I was able to set them up wirelessly . There was a little bit of a hitch when the Canon directions did not explain sufficiently that I had to hold down the button on my wireless router to get the printer recognized by the network , but after figuring that out everything else went like a dream.Setting up all the features was a snap , even the FAX . A colleague at work who is a serious photographer gave me a gift package of photo printer paper and I was almost immediately test its ability to print photos . I printed both a 4 x 6 photo of my dog for a frame I had at work and an 8 1/2 x 11 photo . Both were as good as professionally printed photos . Needless to say , it does an excellent job with more standard printing jobs . I do have one complaint and that is that printed documents have nowhere to go . You either have to grab them by hand or you have to let them spill all over the desk or floor . This seems like a pretty fundamental flaw . When you are printing a single photo this is n't a problem , but if you are printing a 25 page paper , it very definitely is.I love the scanning capability . The printer does a great job of finding whatever it is that you are wanting to scan , regardless of where you place it on the glass . I spent a few hours scanning a bunch of my old film photos . I printed a couple and the quality , especially after adjusting the pictures using the utilities included , was remarkable.All in all this is one of the best printers that I have owned . The print quality is exceptional for the cost . The only serious flaw is the one mentioned of its not having a means for catching multi-page documents . I am also concerned to find out how long the printer cartridges last . This is a bit of a concern because the replacement cartridges are very expensive indeed . Still , if you are looking for an all purpose photo printer , you would be hard pressed to find something better for the price .	1
I love Canon PIXMA printers . They 're reliable , work great over wireless networks , and print incredibly vibrant pictures . This PIXMA all-in-one is a bit smaller than my previous one but is still an awesome all-in-one machine . Unlike one of the previous PIXMA all-in-ones I 've reviewed this one does n't have an autofeeder . If you plan on scanning a lot of multipage documents this one might not be perfect for you but there are other PIXMA machines out there that fit the bill and also perform wonderful.Once again , this printer does text just as wonderfully as it does pictures and I 've had no problems with paper jams , over-saturated papers , or any problems at all really . I primarily print black-and-white text documents on it but it handles the few pictures I print wonderfully as well . ( I know I sound so positive but I previously had an HP that made me want to tear my hair out and these Canons have been a huge step up ! ) Set up for this machine took me a little longer than last time but it had to do with having a different router and not the printer itself . ( I had to go the standard installation route to connect it with wi-fi which took a few extra steps than using `` push '' which my router did n't support . ) It was still a straight-forward simple process.This machine is also really convenient because I can put the printer wherever there 's an available outlet instead of it having to be immediately next to the computer . I love these printers and ca n't imagine ever buying another HP printer again .	1
This is my second air printer that works with my iphone and ipad . The syncing on this printer was simple and just about instant.The printing quality is great.I love that the paper loads from the bottom so you can put items on top of the printer to save space.The memory slot and print function without a printer is OK but a little cumbersome.Overall it 's a fantastic printer ESPECIALLY if you are looking for something to print a quick email from your iphone on .	1
I am a convert , I decided to review this because my HP printer was acting up.. I thought my old one was easy to set up this is even better.I love how compact this is.Upon opening the box I found the wireless inkjet photo all in one copier unit , the power cord , a black cartridge and a color cartridge , a CD-Rom and manuals etc. , This is a black unit I would have liked it white.I realize some may think the ink is costly but we are talking about printing high quality photos not just homework papers.You can print a 4x6 borderless photo in about 44 seconds that is amazing . It prints on paper sizes , 4 '' x 6 '' , 5 '' x 7 '' , 8 '' x 10 , '' Letter , Legal , U.S. # 10 Envelopes.I have been saving some of my digitals that I want to make 8x10 's to hang on my wall and now I can do this . As for paper , it uses up to 100 sheets of glossy # 2 photo glossy paper and plain paper . No more expensive trips to the photo station at your local CVS . I am happy with this printer/copier and I am sure once I have figured out all the other options I will be even happier .	1
This is an awesome printer ! I would highly recommend it . Works great and the price of paper and ink is very low for what you get.The one downfall is print speed . Takes quite some time to finish a print .	1
This is a nice printer for emergencies . I like that it has a a variety of option for connections : wi-fi , USB , and most important for me , SD-card . I label it is an emergency printer as the most reasonable ink is found in this $ 28 packageCanon KP-108IN Color Ink Paper Set 3115B001 , which means that the price per photo would be around $ .26- $ .27 per print , and a printer for me is as good as the cost of the replacement items , such as ink and paper . Compare that with many store/warehouse specials around $ .09- $ .10 cents per print.2 small issues : - I am not too fond of the skin tones of some of the pictures ( and I shot the pictures with a semi-pro camera ) - The actual prints are slightly smaller than 4x6 , but that difference is approximately 2 % - which , for my purposes , is negligible	1
We got my daughter a little digital camera and wanted to get a simple , photo-focused printer to use along with it that would be very easy to use , and this SELPHY is perfect . It prints beautiful 4x6 photos , has a tiny footprint ( this thing is very small- not much bigger than the photos it prints ! ) , and is easy to set up and use . Just order some extra supplies ( the Canon KP-108IN Color Ink Paper Set ) along with it because it comes with limited ink and paper , and once you see how nicely this prints , you 'll want to print out a lot of stored photos !	1
I 've been in graphics and printing for a long time . Many printers used to use dye-sub to produce the most accurate print proof , printing one color plate on either cyan , magenta , yellow or black film at a time and fusing them together . Because so many presses are digital now , this is not such a common technique . This printer does the same thing producing exquisite photos . The paper passes through four times . The process is pretty cool to watch and the printer must be fairly well designed to be able to keep the paper in the exact location it needs to be for each pass through.The issue I have is that you have to buy the photo paper and 'ink ' at the same time and it can get expensive . It costs about 27 cents per photo it is not competitive with other photo print places . ( Canon KP-108IN Color Ink Paper Set 3115B001 ) .Additionally , you can not print anything larger than a 4 x 6 . I like having a printer that will let me print 5 x 7 or even the occasional 8 x 10.So while it is nice to have it wireless , very compact and offers beautiful prints , it is not practical for most .	1
We bought this for an event where we need to print pictures out immediately for VIP customers.This one works great . I see many professional photographers using the same unit.I compared it with other Epson models and found this one to be faster and cheaper.I like the fact that it 's 4x6 and not many choices . I also bought two blank photo paper and ink kits.The thermal ink runs out pretty quickly ( less than 30 pictures for me ) . But it 's a snap to swap.I used the adjustments to make it whiter and brighter and the pictures turn out very good.If I use the original picture setting , the pictures came out dull and dark.Cost wise , it 's about 50c each picture.For an event , if you have lots of guests and you want to give them great looking pictures to take home.Plan to have 2-3 SD cards and take about 10-15 pictures and swap the SD cards for printer/camera.This way , you can have the pictures printed and still taking wonderful pictures.It 's very small and light weight . The only thing I hate is the huge power adapter .	1
For anyone who likes the convenience of being able to quickly make beautiful , durable 4 X 6 color prints at home or while traveling , with or without a computer , and who does n't want to drag along a much larger but more versatile printer this Canon SELPHY CP900 Black Wireless Color Photo Printer fills that niche nicely . If you print directly from your camera 's memory card , the printer 's color screen displays your photos , allows you to crop and choose how many and which photos you wish to print.Although this printer will work on a Wi-Fi network it works wirelessly ONLY from Windows 7 & 8 , not Windows XP . In February 2013 I was finally able to download Canon 's promised Android app called Canon EPP that prints beautifully from my phone via Wi-Fi . Presumably you can use the app to make prints from an Android tablet as well . I printed wirelessly from my Droid X and later from my Droid RAZR MAXX HD phone and it worked well from both . The USB cable necessary to print from a Windows XP computer and without Wi-Fi is NOT included.This printer bundle includes only enough paper and ink to make five prints . A 108 sheet ink/paper set from AmazonCanon KP-108IN Color Ink Paper Set 3115B001costs almost 28-cents per print . The package contains three 36-sheet packages of paper and three ink cartridges . Aside from its higher cost-per-print and compactness , the dye sublimation , thermal transfer process used by this printer offers several advantages over inkjet technology . There is no liquid ink to freeze , dry out or clog nozzles if this printer is left sitting idle for months , the final coating applied by the printer protects its prints from moisture and when properly stored the print colors should not fade as inkjet prints often do . Canon claims a 100-year life for the prints , but I wo n't live long enough to test that claim.There are several additions that make this printer more useful : 1 . A carrying case offered by Amazon for about twenty bucks is a virtual necessity for taking this printer on the road ; 2 . There is a third-party DC-to-DC adapter from PowerStream that will power this printer from a 12-volt socket for just $ 21.95+S & H . ; It 's available at : [ ... ] Just select and connect the included adapter plug that fits the printer , set the adapter 's output to 24-volts and you 're in business from your car , truck , boat or RV . Canon 's battery and charger/adapter are outrageously priced at about $ 160.00 . ; 3 . Since there are still many Windows XP computers still in operation , there should have been a Wi-Fi driver for Windows XP ; 4 . Add direct-print support for wireless devices , so Wi-Fi is not necessary to print from smart phones and tablets.When printing , there must be enough space allowed behind the printer for it to extend the print paper about six inches as the paper passes through the print engine four times to apply the yellow , magenta , cyan and clear coatings . The USB port on the left side of the printer accommodates various card adapters . I use aPixelFlash USB 3.0 No-Bend Pins Compact Flash Memory Card Reader SuperSpeed CF Adapterto make prints directly from my camera 's Compact Flash card . It is the same adapter I use for my computer . Although I have n't tried all adapters , I suspect that most any USB camera card adapter would work if the flash memory card that your camera uses does n't fit the slot already provided on the printer . This printer does not recognize my smartphone as a compatible device when I connect it to this printer 's USB port , but Canon EPP enables me to make prints via Wi-Fi from my phone .	1
Great , easy to use product for great photos . I take many photographs and this gives me both the creativity and ease of use to produce the photographs I want .	1
I do n't know about anybody else , but I miss actual printed pictures . It 's great that we do n't have to buy film anymore and that we can take pictures anywhere on our phones , but I 'm a little tired of looking at them on most phones little screens . I did n't want anything fancy , just something I could easily print out my pictures with . The Canon SELPHY CP900 is perfect for that . I was very happy with the easy set up , it took me maybe 15 minutes and I was able to print my first picture . It is n't the faster picture printing I have ever done , but that is okay because the pictures really come out great , much better than printing them on my regular big Canon printer . Granted , my printer is n't specifically for pictures , but I compared printing with it and the SELPHY and the SELPHY prints were far superior . They are not at all grainy , ( an issue with the ones from my regular printer ) very crisp and with excellent color . I have no problem using pictures from the SELPHY for framing or in photo albums or for scrapbooks . I love the small size too , easy to move around and store . I even taken it with me on a couple trips . The only minor complaint I might have is that you have to use Canon paper . I have a ton of other photo print paper that is would be nice to use up , but I think the Canon paper probably contributes to the quality of the print , so it really is n't that big of an issue .	1
Not allot of choices in this price range for dye sub printers BTW ! I got two of these lil puppies for a photo booth print set up and they worked flawlessly tethered to my laptop/windows 7/ Lightroom 5/USB to mini USB corded ( both ) / Canon 7D . I printed just under a hundred prints in 3+hours . After a few brightness tweaks they were fine.I did see some banding on a few test prints but apparently it worked itself out.Are the prints perfect ? No , but good enough for normal stuff ... Yes . Probably great for scrap booking as well.Found the wireless set up tedious and lengthy ( I was out of time for testing so I ditched it all together for corded shooting ) .Not reviewing that part as of yet.I 've owned many ( which I did like ) Epson Picturemate models of ink printers BUT if they sit around ... they clog ... need ink wasting cleanings and whatnot and the ink/paper was somewhat expensive so I gave em away and got these as they are ribbon NOT ink.Obviously NO electronic device likes dust so keep them covered.I did knock one combined star off for the loss of the Compact Flash reader , the screen is a bit small by today 's standards and the quality is n't quite perfect.The ribbon and paper is actually reasonably priced as well . ******So ... If you need 4 x 6/passport/scrapbook sized dye sub prints in about 45 seconds that are pretty much waterproof/archival 100 blah blah years then this printer should be seriously considered especially when the price is low.There are more detailed reviews here already but this is my experience in a real world use and I will up date this in time . Thanks , Mako .	1
This printer met and exceeded my expectations ! It prints quality photos quickly ... this has become my new photo printer ... you will not be disappointed ! Well worth the price : )	1
This a very compact color photo printer that can print from WiFi , a free Canon Iphone app , from an SD card or USB from a computer.Size : The printer is super small and you can fit in both hands easily.The printing from you iPhone works flawlessly and there is no delay in printing your pictures . I like it because you can print pictures for your friends right away and it 's small enough that you could carry this on trips or to parties.Speed : The prints take 110 seconds each to print.Quality : Print quality is average for this type of printer and the colors are a little muted and the skin tones have a very smooth quality to them with some loss of detail . This are slightly lower quality than photos you would print at Costco or Target.There is a very nice LCD screen that has easy to use menus and the buttons are well sized.Negatives : Print quality ca n't compare to larger more expensive printers but it does a great job for such a small printer.It only comes with a few pieces of paper so you need to buy more.The INK costs about $ 29 and you can get around 108 prints per cartridge.Overall , would recommend it for ease of use and if you want to print pictures from you iPhone with an easy to use app.If you found this review helpful please give it a thumbs up . Thanks !	1
I have an HP 48GX that has been kicking for more than twenty years and an HP 11 that is more than 25 years old and still flawless . I have had this 12C for about 18 months and the number 5 key is already giving me trouble ( have to press hard for it to register ) . No drops , no abuse . The overall feel of this new HP is cheaper plastic . The keys feel hollow and light . The available functions are great . This is a classic calculator . But the functions are no good if the keys stop working ...	-1
These ubiquitous texas instrument calculator that everyone thinks are so great are complete garbage . Compared to 15c or 42s by HP this is not a tool , but a child 's toy or just a piece of land fill luggage .	-1
Overall I do not recommend this product . I remember this calculator from several years ago during various math classes . Bought this as a replacement as I require a calculator with specific test specifications . Works great and very intuitive , however the keys require just enough more pressure than they used to so that it is annoying . Perhaps they will become broken in . Not yet though .	-1
Bought this product recently based on recommendations for an advanced math/ scientific calculator . Apparently , TI has almost all the schools eating out of their hands by having classrooms make these calculators mandatory in many classes.I will say that the calculator features a lot and you can even purchase more applications to dowload at TI 's Website . However , the calculator is complicated to use , and you almost need a course to learn how to use it . Furthermore , the functionality is poorly designed and if you press a wrong button the calculator will often freeze on you.At the high price for these TI calculators you would think that they would have gotten all the bugs out . But let me assure you they are definitely there , and you would be better served to get a Casio or HP graphing calculator instead .	-1
Parents : If you 're going to buy your child a graphing calculator for school , DO N'T insult his/her intelligence with this limited function calculator . Go with a TI-86 or TI-89 as it will serve him/her well through into college . What this means is you save money by purchasing one calculator that will be useful for SATs , GREs , AP tests , high school , algebra , calculus 1-3 , college , etc ... If you buy a TI-83 , you will have to get a TI-86 or TI-89 in the future because a TI-83 is an OVERGLORIFIED TI-82 , which is really good for pre-algebra and algebra.GRANTED you can use a TI-83 for Calculus and more advanced math , but it 's a good idea to allow your child to grow intellectually by learning how to use a much more advanced calculator for Calc II and III . I had no problems using a TI-86 for Calc 2 and 3 , but the TI-89 definitely helped me understand theorems that were in 3 dimensions.For those who are looking for a calculator to use at work : The TI-83 is a piece of junk . It 's for kiddies in 6th grade.The TI-86 is a better engineering calc than the TI-89 due to its more intuitive menu interface for units conversions and what not.The TI-89 is better suited for theoretical math work because of its `` pretty print '' and units system . Plus with the right software mods , you can do differentiation/integration with the variables intact - just a time saver really.However I realize you 're just trying to find info on the TI-83 . My overall recommendation for the TI-83 is : do n't bother . It 's a solid calculator but pay a bit more and get at least a TI-86 . It will serve you WELL into frosh or sophomore year of college ( Calculus I-III ) . A TI-83 will have served its absolute purpose by the start of your senior year in high school.It 's like bringing a 9mm pistol in an African Safari . It will handle meerkats and other small creatures but once you get to the larger predators - it will not work very well . The TI-86 and TI-89 is comparable to a .50AE and .50 Magnum . It can tackle small stuff but will hold its own when the big beasts come around .	-1
This product is for real geeks only . I bought it as a souvenir and office decoration.If you want something serious and practical , get an iphone ( or any other smartphone ) and a financial calculator app that can do Black-Scholes option pricing and many other fixed income and derivative stuff that this calculator can not do .	-1
This is a good calculator as would be expected from Texas Instruments , who have been in the calculator business for decades . A calculator should do the functions that it is supposed to do , which this calculator does . However , like several other 's have noted , the keys can be a challenge . I 've had to start over after entering a number due to the numbers not enterring as they should have . A good press of the keys takes care of that issue , but most calculators do not need to have the keys pressed firmly for the correct operation ... If Texas Instruments could redesign around the key issue , this would be a five star calculator , as the case and display are well designed . I have only used this calculator for a total of maybe 15 - 20 hours , and the keys may work better over time , but I have not seen any change during the timeframe noted.Update 6/16/11 - I 'm hoping that I ended up with a lemon , and that this is not an indicator of TI 's quality standards . I 'm dropping my rating from 4 stars to 2 stars . The decimal button works only when pressed firmly as do several other buttons on this calculator . When taking a timed test in a finance class , this calculator really failed me because of these issues . Even being aware of the issues with the calculator I found myself having to redo calculations several times for most of the problems due to the calculator not taking the decimal point . In over thirty years of using calculators I have never had one with issues like this . At this point , I 'd only recommend this calculator to my enemies , not my friends .	-1
UPDATE : After a couple of weeks my opinion of this has dropped . The only good thing is that it has the same nylon covering as the original version . But the gel ( or whatever they use now , it used to be gel ) feels as hard as a rock and is really unpleasant to use . I thought I could live with the thinner padding but this is really really unpleasant to use.This is n't a worthless wrist rest but I 'm giving it one star because Fellowes should n't be selling this under the same product ID ( down to the model number ) when it 's significatnly different.It is significantly shallower ( in terms of thickness ) and hence does n't offer nearly as much padding . It 's also shallower front to back.This is n't a bad wrist rest ( and they are much cheaper now : I paid roughly $ 13 for this compared to $ 18 4 years ago for the same product ID ) , but they are not in any way the previous generation.Some people might consider this a better product as they make not like the height of the earlier ones .	-1
Busted open the second day . Too much weight on it or a crappy product ? Maybe just a flawed item in the mass distribution ? Whatever the reason , it busted open ( cool to see the gel stuff though : ) Wo n't buy ever again , though .	-1
Lasted only about a month before the edges started coming apart . After 2 months , it was totally dirty and had to be trashed . Worst mouse pad I 've ever used and that counts the free ones I get at conventions .	-1
Should I be complaining about something that was less than a dollar ? Yes , absolutely.The top layer of material , the red layer , is coming off from both the top and bottom of the muse pad after about a week 's worth of normal use . The adhesive or bonding process is n't holding the two layers together.The size of the mouse pad is very good.It tends to slide around on my desk with very little effort.Waste of time with this mouse pad . Surprised at the lack of quality from Belkin .	-1
This was delivered without the starter pack and without the carrier . Had no way to try it out . Returned to sender .	-1
I bought it here it was supposed to be NEW and Genuine.But I got an opened unit , NO seal , NO yellow cover , NO instructions , NO orig box , it was just wrapped hastily in bubble wrap ( small bubbles single layer ) and put in an already used amazon box with cracks . Upon inspection , the roller was dusty and had hair on it ! I left a poor review for the seller , but he begged me to delete the review and for shipping refund . If anything I should have returned the item but I needed to use it . Upon use it leaked all over the place , I had to spend a long time maintaining the unit and wiping with dry ( not wet ) paper towels . It worked for a day and then slowly it leaked all over again ! The fax came in all totally smudged with ink . I thought my machine was old and had a tech come over to look , We replaced the toner and it worked fine , WTH ? ! I pay good money for bad crap , never again ! $ 65 here vs $ 99 @ Office Depot , but you get what you pay for !	-1
Our printer is listed on this package , however it is cleary the wrong cartridge . Ours uses the 220 which is shorter . Rather than trust the package check your cartridge prior to ordering . The number is clearly visible .	-1
You get what you pay for . Cheap is cheap . Sometimes they work , sometimes they do n't . But to hand out to clients that will not return , it 's perfect , that was we do n't lose our better pens .	-1
My house was built in the 1950s and the interior walls are covered in plaster not dry wall . This stuff is as hard as rock and even small pictures take substantial nails as the nail has to be strong enough to survive the pounding . Double sided mounting tape seemed like a great idea.The trial was made with a framed picture weighing about eight ounces . Tape was placed across the back of the frame at the top and another strip at the bottom . The picture was pressed into place above a peg board of hooks , which supported the weight of the picture . All the tape had to do was to hold on.The picture stayed in place about 36 hours and then fell down with a clatter . I note two things that partially excuse this : the plaster wall is rough with a gritty texture and the picture 's placement was near a heat vent . This mounting tape held on longer than any similar product , but that is n't saying much .	-1
Look , it is a mouse pad . It really does n't even & # 34 ; work & # 34 ; - it just is , except when it comes apart . Two days , that 's all I got . Bad Dog .	-1
The color was coming off within a few weeks . Within a month , all the edges are peeling . This has got to be one of the worst mousepads ever made .	-1
I got this for very cheap and well worth it as an add-on item , a few days later the price doubled as most things on Amazon do . Just keep watching the item you might score .	-1
I have one in red also , I bought both at the same time.After just a few days of use , the top ( colored ) layer is separating from the bottom ( base ) layer.Belkin usually makes high quality products.I 'm very disappointed in these mouse pads.I would not recommend them .	-1
I ordered 2 premium mousepads . Amazon sent 1 premium and one 65 cent standard blue.The premium one makes my new-ish Logitech optical mouse skip , hang , lag . It does work on my 15 year old Microsoft Explorer optical mouse.Also , the edges are so sharp I feel like I 'm going to slit my wrist on it.Would not recommend .	-1
How bad can a mouse pad be ? That 's what I thought ... .First , be aware this is a HARD top mouse pad . Basically , it is a hard sheet of blue plastic glued onto a 3/32 '' foam pad . Not a rubber pad like other mouse pads , but a foamy pad.The plastic top is bigger than the foam pad on all sides , and cuts into my hand which rests on the edge of the pad.The mouse pad is n't quite flat on the table - the plastic top is slightly curled and one edge of the mouse pad sticks up slightly until I push the mouse over it . It is very distracting.Finally , the surface is just rough enough to make a loud scratchy nose as my optical mouse moves over it . VERY annoying.This is the WORST mouse pad I 've ever used.The only pro is it has a weird new plastic smell that reminds me of grape popsicles , so 2 stars .	-1
This stand may be good for pamphlets , ring-bound manuals , magazines and typing sheets but definitely not for text books . It is unstable and the page holders ca n't hold any page open for even a nano second . Try the The Easi-Reader Bookstand or Mighty Bright Folding/Adjustable Book Holder instead .	-1
These labels are too small for return address ' . They could work with postcards , but not much else .	-1
only .5 '' high not 1 '' fabric is not durable , wears through and hard to keep cleanother than obvious lack of function due to height , no leaks , does not stiffen up over timeInnovera is a better brand	-1
The wrist pad I brought a couple of months ago had a terrible smell when I purchased it and the smell is still there but not as strong . Now the gel is coming out at the seams . I can not use the wrist rest and I tried to fix it but it can not be fixed . I would not recommend this item .	-1
I use these labels with `` Poly Bubble '' mailers to ship items . Twice in the last couple of months I 've had items returned because the labels came off at some point during shipping . The mailers I 'm using are brand new and have a smooth surface ; there is no reason an address label should n't stick to them . It 's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers , but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative .	-1
I tried this product and liked it , but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs to Manilla , Philippines ! ! ! On their web site , Avery give the appearance that they are located in Brea , California , but in reality all of their consumer inquires , information on their products , software support , and general questions are all routed to the Philippines . I was not able to connect with anyone in the USA after more than 30 minutes on the phone with several different people in Manilla.In addition , all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China . I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products . **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easy to use . Once you down load the software there will be a new toolbar in Microsoft Word . You simply click the Avery button and it gives you a comprehensive list of all of the Avery products ( listed by product number ) . After that is takes you through a few easy-to-understand wizard windows to enter the text and layouts your labels . Once completed , you have a MS-Word document that you can save on your computer and reprint if needed . I was able to make address labels with a small graphic quite quickly and easily.Even though these are listed for use on a Laser printer , I used them on my ink-jet printer and they turned out quite well . Even after roughing up the label by crunching it up , it stayed clear and legible . The `` Easy Peel '' backing allows you to reposition or remove the label although it does hold in place and will not easy fall off .	-1
Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec , you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers , 1 x 2-5/8 Inches , Box of 3000 Labels ( 5160 ) . The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper . It then offers you `` Pop-up Edge for fast peeling '' . I do n't think it is worth the extra charge at all . Go get the basic one . You will be very happy with it .	-1
I tried this product and liked it very much , but tried to call Avery to gather more information and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs ! ! ! If you call Avery 's Consumer Service Center ( 1-800-462-8379 number listed on their web site as Brea , California ) you will be given several choices of support all of which route you to their customer , product , and software staff in Manilla , Philippines.I wanted to get more information on where their products are manufactured . The operator I spoke with and her supervisor both assured me that all Avery products are made in the U.S.A. in Brea , California , but some of the raw materials may be from other countries . They were unable to route me to anyone in Brea to confirm this information . After examining the packaging I have I found a sticker that said `` Made in Mexico . '' Other Avery products I have say either Mexico or China . None say U.S.A.I am very hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with their products . **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I have used sharpie pens on all my well-used file folders and decided to try these file folder labels by Avery . I was surprised how well they blocked out the old hand-written tabs with clean new labels . The TrueBlock Technology is simply a silver backing on the sticky side of the label.As for the templates , I downloaded the Avery 8366 template for MS-Word on Avery 's website , but was disappointed that I could not get the text to center on the label when I increased the text to a legible size . So , I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easier to use than the template . It comes with a few colorful graphics to make your labels interesting . I was able to use a big text size and center the text vertically and horizontally.Once I had my labels printed out , it was easy to peel and place the labels right in the file drawers , and I had a whole file drawer of easy-to-read folder tabs.A couple side notes . 1 ) Avery required that you give them your name and email for downloading a simple template which I did n't like . In addition during the Avery Wizard 4.0 install there is a box automatically checked to also install the Avery `` Ask '' toolbar and make it your default search engine . You can easily uncheck it , but rather tricky of Avery to set as the default to install additional software on your computer . 2 ) If you try and remove the label on your file folders , they do not easily release and you 'll peel off some of your file folder with the label.Again , this may be a useful product , but very disappointing that Avery continues to outsource all their customer support and manufacturing !	-1
I was pleased to receive these as I had filing to do . I printed out a sheet of file labels , and then applied them to file folders I was re-using . I was extremely disappointed as I could see the writing right through the label , making for a very messy look . NOT recommended at all . I had to go buy new labels ...	-1
Yeah , it 's a mouse pad , but the top surface is poorly attached and curled up very quickly . Better to have one that 's all one piece .	-1
Great classic design . I imagine it is a wonderful phone if you get one that works . Mine refused to ring , and yes I checked the ring setting . Returned it .	-1
This phone started to have problems around the 1yr mark . First , a lot of static and now it just keeps disconnecting calls . Looking for another .	-1
Great price on the phone , but quality of sound is not good . It still can be used if you main phone broke and you need temporarily to use something else until you purchase a better phone .	-1
August 2012 . I purchased two of these phones to wall mount in my basement and garage . They work - meaning they ring - but I get complaints about voice quality on every call . Cost was $ 9.00 each with free shipping ( assuming the order totaled at least $ 25.00 ) Despite some remarks that these phones can not be wall mounted , those statements are simply NOT true . I have two of these phones , both of which are currently wall mounted . As noted in the instructions , you must reverse a clip on the base unit for wall mounting . That clip then provides a tab/hook that keeps the phone firmly in place on the base unit . This type of arrangement is essentially universal to all phones that I 've ever seen that can be both used horizontally or vertically . To switch the tab from horizontal to vertical mounting took less than 5 seconds.Another bit of confusion . A few reviewers state that the cord from the base to phone is hard wired and can not be replaced with a longer one . That is not true , at least in 2012 . The cord has standard clips on both ends and can be replaced at will.Yet despite that mis-information - I 'm VERY disappointed with the voice quality . Every time I answer these phones people complain ( unsolicited ) about the voice quality . A hard wired phone ( as opposed to a cordless ) should sound great but clearly these phones do n't ! Your only real option for a better hard wired phone would be a Panasonic , at about $ 30.00 .	-1
I ordered i think 4 70-sheet notebook spirals , and 2 100-sheet sprials from this company that sent me the wrong items from SAM 'S club ? ? But I didnt return the 2 1oo-sheet spirals along with the 4 120-sheet spirls ? because 1 . I didnt feel like waiting for them any longer when I needed them for school 2 . So that i would n't spend any more money on more page spirals at walmart or office depot so it 's okay that my order got wrong . I had already ordered 70 sheet spirals of Mead from another company just in case it happened ... They are nice notebooks though . Paper quality is a bit thicker than your average thin ..smearable paper if you write with pencil alot ( which I do n't unless its a math or number involved class ) I like them .	-1
I have owned the Brother HL-1240 Laser Printer about a year now . I have no quarrels with the printer itself , but the cartridges are a real pain.The first four cartridges I used the 3000-copy cartridge . They ran out really quickly , so I shifted to the TN-560 6000-copy cartridge.Here is the amount of copies I got on the four 3000-copy cartridges : 2000 , 2500 , 2500 , 1900.This is the performance I 've gotten on the first two TN-560 600-copy cartridges I 've used : 4600 and ****2500*** ! ! ! For the latter , a black line appeared on the right side of the page after 2500 copies , making the cartridge useless , even though it still had ink.Tip for getting more copies from these Brother toner cartridges : you can often get an additional 300-500 copies after the red light on the printer starts blinking , indicating you need to change the toner . But it is very irritating having that light blink all the time.I am trying to figure out who I should complain to about these very poor product ... . every single toner cartridge I 've bought from them so far vastly under-performs -- up to 40 % -- on the number of copies promised by Brother .	-1
There are two hundred sheets in the package which is the average size . This package of wide ruled filler paper looks like the standard elementary school paper that kids have always used . That is before you take it out of the package . Paper used to be two or three times as thick as this when I was in school . This paper if so thin that it 's totally transparent when you hold it up to the light . When writing on it with an ink pen the ink goes totally through it . In addition it rips very easily and if it gets at all wet then you are done.Other that the thinness problem the paper is normal . The lines are the correct spacing and are dark enough for the most part but there are some pages that are lighter than others.The price of this package of paper stunned me at 3 dollars a pack . I can purchase the same amount of paper from my local grocery store for about 1 dollar a package . When they have back to school sales it 's often only about 50 cents a pack so why on earth would I pay that much for paper ? Overall when I consider the quality of the paper and the price I simply am not impressed and would not recommend this paper .	-1
I am so disappointed in Mead . I know that this is a standard product , not a luxury version . It is just plain old lined paper . But it is such bad paper . It is thin . It has not tooth . The printing of the lines is not consistent . They are darker in some places than others . It is thin enough that my lefty went through it easily.This all just makes for an awful writing experience . Basic does n't have to mean worthless .	-1
The paper is thin and rips easily . I thought it would be fun to give my 7-year-old a notebook full of paper to use as she wished this summer , but even though she 's a pretty careful kid , pages have already ripped at the holes and need reinforcements . I expected more from Mead . This is more along the lines of what I 'd expect from a dollar-store brand .	-1
I got this paper for my first grader to practice writing with . I never thought I would complain about binder paper , but this paper is pretty awful . The paper , while it serves its purpose , is really quite thin . I would n't recommend using pen on this paper , and heaven forbid you try to use marker or anything liquid on it . With pencil , it works just fine . My biggest issue is when you need to erase . If you have a light hand , erasing should n't be a problem . However , with wide ruled paper , most people who use it are little kids ... and if your kid is like mine , erasing is practically a full arm production . The paper is not durable enough to withstand the erasing of a six year old or from people who are vigorous when erasing.That aside , the paper does serve its purpose . My kid , when he did n't make mistakes , was able to write very easily on the paper , and it did n't smudge much . If you 're pressed for time and want to order paper online , this will definitely serve its purpose . Otherwise , I would wait for upcoming back to school sales . You can get much higher quality paper at a comparable price .	-1
There is nothing to write home about this paper . The paper is very thin and the writing shows on the other side of the sheet quite a bit .	-1
This would be a real deal -- if only it was compatible with Windows XP , which it is not . Before you buy it , use a good search engine to find user comments , and you 'll discover that ( 1 ) Brother is still negotiating with Microsoft over XP drivers , and ( 2 ) Brother 's support is non-existent . Even their website is useless.Not good .	-1
I had to throw this printer out . It was simply too unreliable.The first unit I had streaked . After three exchanges of the printer , they finally sent me a new drum.This printed for about 4 months , and the streaks re-appeared.I have never been so aggravated by a printer and suggest extremecaution before buying .	-1
There 's no reason to order this paper when you can get comparable paper delivered from Staples or Office Depot at a fraction of the price . Also , after making the switch to that generic paper , I 've experienced fewer jams on my inkjet printer .	-1
My order came from 'The Witz and Sons ' , fulfilled by Amazon.I 've bought HP ink through Amazon for years and never once had an issue . This time what I received was questionable.The product is advertised as being in retail packaging , and the photo shows an HP package.However , when I opened the Amazon box , what was inside was not in an HP retail box . Instead the ink cartridge arrived `` unboxed . '' There was no HP cardboard box . It arrived in only the HP inner foil package . That means there was NO HP box , NO UPC and , of course , NO explicit expiration date listed.The only thing on the package , outside of the HP logo , is a foil code . In my case the foil code is SG2 110800 100218 1133 . I happen to be familiar with the codes on HP foil , so reading the two sets of six numbers in yymmdd format , I was able to see that what I was sent had an `` ink warranty '' that expired about 9 months ago back in August 2011 ( 110800 ) , and was produced in February of 2010 ( 100218 ) .While many people use ink past the warranty date , that should be the choice of the consumer . Here , it seems likely the seller removed the box to try to pass off a `` old '' product as fresh , which is deceitful , at best .	-1
This printer is the biggest ink hog I have ever seen . If you download the optional ink reserve software you can actually see your expensive inks disappear . Granted , when the printer is working properly you can get wonderful images . If you are not constantly printing , the nozzles will clog . It is almost impossible to find anyone to work on these printers because the nozzles are built into the printer . After throwing a couple hundred down the drain on this printer , I smartened up and bought a Canon Pro9000 . My new Canon is a wonderful wide format printer with easy installation and the nozzle cartridge is removable !	-1
Doing a simple internet search will take you down the path to finding this product currently for $ 29.97 . Do not pay this seller twice it 's value , especially since most of us do n't have land lines anymore . Anyone selling it for so much is trying to unload their inventory and get their money back . Buyer beware and do your research . That being said , any device that sends out the `` disconnected line '' tones will be effective against robocalls . Other cheaper options are to download the sound of a fax machine onto your laptop and play that when you see a robocall come in . Of course you 'd only be successful at that method if you kept getting repeat robocalls from the same unknown area code.If you really want to have fun with these `` poor souls just trying to eek out a living like anyone else '' just tie them up on the phone for a long time . They get paid by the number of calls they handle and the number of scams they pull off . So tie up their time and you can have a small passive-aggressive victory dance around the dinner table . Do n't yell or get angry at them . They 're already locked and loaded for those calls . Plus it will just get your adrenaline going and make you angry . Nothing good will come of that other than you being angry . They 're just going to call someone else and so on and so on . Just pretend like you care about what they 're saying and drag on their conversation for a long while.Other options for meddling with them are blasting a loud whistle or horn in the phone ( but some digital phones will cut out the loud noise . So that does n't always work . I 've also had success pretending to be a business when I see the caller ID and recognize the robocall area code ( NYC in this case ) . Once they realize it 's a business they called the operator will usually take you off the list because a business is n't engageable in a personal currency scam . In the end they 'll always be harrassing you as long as you have a phone ( like junk mail in your mailbox ) . Even if your number is unlisted these machines will randomly dial numbers at digital speeds . So do n't think the machines ca n't get through .	-1
This paper was not really of the high quality standards I have come to expect from Mead products in the past . While it is fine for it 's intended purpose and useable I find the thickness of the paper to be extremely thin and the lines on the backside of some of the pages from this pack were so faded I had trouble seeing them . Honestly , I expected better .	-1
120 days later the dialing function no longer works . Very poor quality construction . Too bad , this was a nice phone initially .	-1
When I got this product I realized it was extremely heavy and complex to put together . Not exactly what I thought I would be getting . Then unpacking I realized it took up a huge footprint on my limited desk space . This thing is just too big for a regular person 's desk and more fitting to be in some kind of industrial fabrication plant . Seriously , the design is old and not very useful . It 's also severely overpriced .	-1
This looked wonderful when I first saw it , I happen to like the sleek looking modern design ( much more in tune with our decorating then theClear Solutions Jumbo Cookbook Holdercookbook holder I 've been using . Yes I said cookbook holder , granted I realize this product is far from being advertised as a cookbook holder but I was hoping for something multipurpose . Cookbook holder , sheet music holder for practice times for my daughter and husband , document holder for my husband or myself , and reference book/sheet holder for our homeschooled daughter as we do n't need to use it for all those things at once I hoped this would function well for each as needed.Upon opening the box I was dumbfounded , I 'm a college educated adult who has fixed her own dryer and dishwasher along with assembling lots of furniture in our home and yet I stared at this lost , the directions ... well they just are n't . I had to go off of the images here online to get it together and I must still be doing something wrong since I 've almost put out my eye , my childs eye , and the dogs eye with the darn elastic strap part ... it keeps flying off the device and across the room.Also I realized this would be big , but you just do n't realize how big until it 's set up , and heavy . Great for holding down big books but not making it very moving friendly and between the band and weight not something I 'd consider using for my original idea of letting our little girl use it for reference books unless we set it up for her . I also find the band annoying , how it could be a line marker is beyond me as it 's not quick nor easy to move and it just ends up being in the way of text , leading to trying to pull it out of the way and ZOOOMMM off it goes across the room again : :sighs : :I think I 'm going to retire this to our desk for adult use only , making the retail and even amazon price crazy for what it will actually do for us . On a side note the before mentioned cookbook holder that I have is wonderful , lightweight but holds the biggest books with ease , nothing to fling off or put an eye out , and it folds up in seconds to store flat ... I highly recommend checking it out if you 're looking for something to hold books open ( being that it has no real back it would n't work well for documents only ) . I love 3M ( could you imagine life w/o sticky notes ? ) but I think they missed the bar on this one .	-1
This product weighs a ton , or at least way more than a document holder made for sheets of paper . Also , unless your monitor is well above the desk , anything you put in this will block the screen , plus you need room front to back room between your keyboard and monitor . Buy this only if you have the space and need the holder for heavy items . For papers ( e.g. , contracts , homework ) use a document holder that is longer top to bottom ( or tape the pages one at a time to a top corner of your monitor ) .	-1
3M ( TM ) Copy Holder , In-line , 18 Inches Wide , 300 Sheet Capacity , Black and ClearI am getting old . I remember when $ 100 ( $ 65 Amazon price ) actually bought something . Oh , wait , it still can . AppleTV is $ 100 . A Roku box is $ 100 . A Kindle is just $ 40 more . But , now in 2010 an 18 '' sheet of molded plastic two weighted plastic legs some assorted screws and knobs and a rubber band cost $ 100 . I have to assume the mystery weight beads in the legs are made of a high tech alloy and the plastic sheet must be bullet proof ? On top of that when assembled it 's kind of wobbly . I 'd have designed in a cross base support of some kind for rigidity . But , that might have driven the price up to $ 150 ? I did a quick search for a `` Copy Holder , '' what I found was a huge selection under $ 10 . Granted many were n't as attractive as the 3M product but what price design for such an item . It just needs to hold paper or a book.If the constructed product did n't feel as wobbly as it does , maybe I 'd forgive it . But , really , I ca n't get over the price to function ratio . I have many 3M products and many are well made and reasonably priced . I just ca n't review this product favorably . Your money is my concern . When you spend this much on a stationery product , it really should be beyond compare . This simply is not . There are better choices considering the price . If this was about $ 15- $ 20 maybe I 'd say it 's pretty and does the job . Yet , it 's still unsteady if you need to move it periodically . There are many better cost effective choices .	-1
A document holder that 's this wide ( wider than a keyboard , but not so wide I can slide mine under it when not in use ) might be expect to hold , say , a dictionary or a heavy cookbook . I would n't trust this one with a paperback . The vise grips on either leg do not hold the stand firmly no matter how much I tighten them . And the legs wobble . Adjusting the position is difficult and not in synch with both sides . The stretchy band stretches too much to hold some types of books ' pages flat . All in all , the design is just crappy.It looks nice and the individual pieces are solidly crafted . ( The heavy , wobbly legs have so far failed to snap the plastic rails off the sides , as physics might predict . ) There are apparently mounts for this that you can buy separately that screw into a surface . This might alleviate the wobble factor , although I hope those mounts use grips that actually keep the plastic from sliding down.Bottom line : A quick search on Amazon reveals a number of other document holders . Unless you like frustration , this is probably not the one you want .	-1
Useful but you need a big desk to find room for this ! Also , the price is too much for what you get . Also , kind of wobbly.I would not recommend this for the price . It should either be better designed or half the price . And I do n't mean half the list price ; I mean half the $ 60 Amazon price . And even that would be pushing it .	-1
This 3M Copy Holder is almost good ; half-baked design and cheesy construction make it a bad deal , even at amazon 's deep discount . ( The MSLP is absurdly high ! ) There are several different ways tobreak the copy area , as it is made of very thin transparent plastic . The legs are weighted , butwould be far more stable with some sort of crossbar installed between them ... this could certainlybe done by someone who is reasonably handy . The holding device is nothing but a thin elastic heldby two sliding plastic pieces which will also break easily . Replacing the elastic should n't be tough , which is good , because it 's definitely not going to stand up to heavy use- maybe not even light use.Replacing the two holders , though , is probably next to impossible . Why were n't some extras included ? It must be said that the few books and catalogs I used for testing were held open pretty well.This product is not designed for very thick books , however . It 's also not designed for long-termuse . Why pay this price for such an inadequate unit ? There must surely be better ones available.Those who need a sturdy copy holder for heavy duty everyday use are hereby urged to avoid this one.Shame on 3M for peddling this junk- one would expect far better from such a company ... right ?	-1
I do like the fact that this stand has adjustable angles but am taken aback by the price/design ratio . The way that the legs attach to the sides of the support makes the stand wobbly if you are putting heavy books on it . The 3M engineers did not do their usual excellent job with design on this product.The elastic band is basically like a rubberband my daughter uses in her hair , with two plastic attachments to it . For this price a few extras should have been included . I had envisioned my kids using it to hold up textbooks when working on homework and this stand simply can not handle the weight.Overall , it works ok , but for this price it should be much sturdier and be nearly perfect .	-1
To me , this kit seems like a cheap product , overall . And an unnecessary one.You get a couple of very small microfiber cloths and a cheap tool made of foam rubber that has a material something like Velcro on one side ( that you scrub with ) and a U-shaped prong on each end . Apparently the prongs are for going between the keys on the keyboard . You also get a small bottle of cleaning fluid.I ca n't see where anyone really needs any of this . You 're better off using a damp cloth or something else . 3M ( if it 's the same company ) makes some other very good products . I 've used their wet or dry sandpaper over a period of years and it 's excellent . But I would n't recommend this particular product at all .	-1
Not so great , I do n't like this , it not do anything to your computer .bye bye no more buy for this	-1
I think they 're rotten , and they do n't begin to compare in quality with my earlier , bona fide Memorex CD labels . The reason I say they 're rotten is because the labels wo n't come off in one piece allowing me to center them very nicely on the CD/DVD , so it 's made it a lot more work for me !	-1
I tried this product and liked it very much , but tried to call Avery to gather more information on their products and was disappointed with the fact that they have outsourced all of what used to be US jobs ! ! ! On Avery 's web site they have their Consumer Service Center shown as Brea , California . I called the number listed ( 1-800-462-8379 ) and was given several choices of support . There is an option for templates and software , products , and all other issues . Any of the options you choose whether you 're calling from the US or Canada will route you to their `` call center '' in Manilla , Philippines . In addition , all of their products are manufactured in either Mexico or China , not Brea , California , USA . I am hesitant to use or recommend Avery products since there are very few US jobs associated with any their products . It would be really nice if Avery was up-front on their web site and list their `` Consumer Service Center '' as Manilla ; o ) **************************************************My initial review of the product was good prior to my call to the `` Consumer Service Center '' in Manilla : I downloaded the Avery Wizard 4.0 to help me make the labels . It took some time to download and install , but well worth the time . The wizard was easy to use . I was able to use a big text size and printed the row of 5-tab labels quickly and easy.Once I had my labels printed out , I was able to lay down the row of tab sheets ( you can not do this if the tabs are already in the notebook ) , align , rub-down into place , and then peel away the outside edging . If you have a lot of tabs to make at once this product would be very helpful . You get 10 sets of 5-tab rows per sheet.On the other hand , I still like using the Avery 612797 tabs which has 80 tabs per sheet and better for times when you just need to print a couple tabs .	-1
To use this product , first of all you have to download a template from the Avery website . Not necessarily a bad thing , but a time drain if you 're on a time crunch putting together the final steps of a presentation . Then when you do have the template you find that the spaces you have to type your title in are ridiculously small - you have to play with font and size until it fits . Again , another time drain . In my case , the ultimate failure was that the tabs did not extend past the edge of my paper in the binder , making it look as if there was any organization . This required a mad rush to the local office supply store to purchase the old fashioned type of tabs , which looked much better . I would not recommend this product at all .	-1
I am not impressed . Sure , if you manage to get it just right , your tabs will look gorgeous . But it is SO difficult to get right ! I would n't recommend these tabs ... old school dividers with tabs that you can either write on or print out label for are MUCH easier and more practical for most uses .	-1

I gave it 2 stars because it does not have a warning label.I had purchased this at another store and when I first used it I cut too much off the nozzle and spilled some on a trash bag . My cat started licking at it and had to take her to the vet because the bottle does not have any warning stickers . It turns out that the product is mostly vegetable oil and the worse that I would have to watch for is diarrhea in my cat.The product works really well but it is a danger to pets because of the oil 's sweet scent . I 'm only buying it again because it works great , is the same price as they other store , and because I now have my shredder protected from my cat . I strongly advise anyone who uses this product to keep their shredder covered if they have pets or something that may be attracted to the oil . Especially if it has an automatic turn on to protect your pet if they put their tongue in your shredder.Update** I was really upset when I tried writing this review . A better explanation is in my response to a user 's comment .	-1
I guess it does the job , but it sure is messy . I think I 'll just buy the paper that 's already treated to run through the machine next time .	-1
The point is , it 's a large bottle of oil that one is prompted to buy when purchasing a paper shredder . Then when you read the instructions on the shredder , you discover that a few drops of vegetable oil on a piece of paper and then fed into the shredder works just fine.This was a needless expenditure and now I 'm stuck with a fairly large bottle of lubricating oil that I have no use for .	-1
There was at least one reviewer who had indicated the price of this lubricant was reasonable . I am not sure he calculated its cost which is roughly $ 87.00 per gallon . At that price it may be cheaper to never lubricate your shredder and just replace it when it wears out . I am not advocating that you should not lubricate your shredder , but just plain motor oil will be nearly as good and a lot cheaper considering that you can lubricate many items in your home by using an inexpensive oil can filled with inexpensive motor oil . Some may want to use a light grade in one can and a heavier grade in another , but you can save yourself a lot of money over the years by not buying `` special purpose '' lubricants when they are not really needed . Of course you would want to use higher priced synthetic oils like Mobil One in your Ferarri or Mercedes that is required for their warranty , but even that standard for high performance engines is still more than 10 times cheaper than this `` Shredder Oil '' . Decisions on the use of certain types of oil are not going to make or break you , I am just suggesting putting such small decisions into perspective . Its similar to the example of the guy who buys a new car every two years and trades his old one in , but he will change his engine oil every 3,000 miles because that 's what his father told him to do . The only reason for changing the oil so often is if you are selling your car to your father who will keep it for years.In conclusion , if it makes you feel better using the `` special $ 87.00 per gallon shredder oil '' I think you should do so . But you may want to acknowledge that at least some of your decision is based upon how you feel as opposed to how you think .	-1
I paid $ 6 for an Amazon website recomendation to purchase with my Amazon Shredder ... . WHAT BUNK ! ! No where in the manual does it even suggest using oil , but there is no where to even use the oil if you wanted to because the blades are covered with a protective sheild and the oil directions state to put this directly on cutting area ! ! Not that $ 6 is a lot of money , but NEVER EVER should a recomendation link recomending 2 products be purchased for use together , when they can not be , especially when it does not line-up with the manufacturers recomendations . FALSE ADVERTISING basically .	-1
The only reason I bought this product is because of the bottle . I could not find a bottle with a long nozzle in my area . I 'll be refilling the bottle with cheap vegetable oil . I could n't even find this product in local office supply stores . The only thing I could find was a pack of ten sheets of paper impregnated with soybean oil for $ 9.99 . I left the store in a huff that somebody would even think of charging that kind of money for soybean oil . There is simply no need for it .	-1
Originally , I have written a good review : `` I have got this thing to use in the office , I like my feet elevated . It has two height settings , so it is even more convenient than it looks . I personally like it a lot . `` However after just a couple months of using this thing , I pierced it with my heel very easily , and I did n't put a lot of weight on it . It 's very fragile and wo n't work for girls in heels . Very disappointed .	-1
The white board part of it may be nice , but no matter how hard I tried and tightened the locks , the back leg would slip out.I could not get it to stand up while writing on it.I do n't think the plastic locks are strong enough . Maybe mine is defective , but I 'm guessing , it is just poor design .	-1
this came bent and just warped looking . When siting on a desk it takes up waaay too much space , but I suppose mounted on a wall it would be more useful . I just seems so large , bulky and not very convenient .	-1
It 's ok if you want to trim off some excess . But you have to hold the paper very still or the blade will pull it toward the end of the cut . There is no guide , so cutting multiple pieces can be time consuming.I 'm really disappointed in that if I cut a sheet in half and truly want to use both pieces , it partially bends the piece of paper to the right of the blade . I do n't like that at all .	-1
When I first got theSwingline ClassicCut Lite 15-Inch Guillotine Trimmera couple years ago , I was pretty happy with it . I used it mostly for cutting coupons and various craft projects , nothing really over the top.Unfortunately , the product is not very durable for the long run . There are also some safety issues with this product . In use , the unit would lift off the table during cutting . Considering how razor sharp the blade is , this could lead to a serious problem . While I appreciate that this product is lightweight and ultra-portable , this seems to be a contributing factor to this problem . The product also lacks the ability to adjust the edge , thus you may have a harder time getting uniform cuts most of the time . Sometimes the cuts can look uneven and really sloppy.Being made of plastic , the unit has worn over time and I 've started to see cracks in the workmanship . It would have been nicer to see this product made from something more durable like metal . It does n't happen to often , but sometimes the unit snags the paper and rips it . This is mostly in the middle but does n't happen too often . For a long term investment , I would not recommend this cutter .	-1
When the package arrive , all of the pins literally poured to the ground . The box was broken and so were some of the pins ! ! There was ABSOLUTELY NO packaging or protection in the box.For almost $ 9 , this is a total rip off ! !	-1
This product may be fine enough , but the storage process clearly was n't . The binder clips were entwined in elaborate , deep webbing , which I thought might be some kind of strange packaging . Nope . As I tried to pull back the thick white sheet on the clips , there appeared an enormous spider ... the kind of thing you see only in a few places in the U.S. Never again will I buy an Acco product ; I 'd be too terrified of what might appear in the box.I have no idea about the product , as I obviously threw out the box , giant spider , ocean of spider-killer , and all .	-1
Okay , so these business cards are n't all that expensive , but if you can afford to spend about $ 12 knowing that only about 60 of the cards will print well enough to actually be used , well , kudos.First things first , I have a really nice printer . My ink cartridge is brand-new . Yet any sort of image I tried to print came out fuzzy . One of the designs that I tried never dried properly ( even after sitting out in the air for half an hour after being printed ) . So I tried using just text , but the first two cards on the page would print in the proper font and the rest would revert to the default font ! That brings me to the Avery.com templates - do n't bother , they do n't work . No matter how many times I realigned , played with my image and text layouts , etc . - the first two cards would print okay , and the rest would be a disaster . I bought these cards despite the bad reviews that stated exactly what I found in regards to the templates and problems with printing them , thinking `` hey , I 'm pretty good with computers/printers/technology in general , I 'll be able to figure it out '' . Nope , nope , nope . Go to VistaPrint or a similar site and print a couple hundred business cards for $ 20 . It 's worth it .	-1
Or maybe not for my computer ? ? ? However , if I 'm having problems , there may be others out there who would experience the same frustration.My opinion may not be fair , because the trouble I had could be related to my PC . I have never attempted to make my own business cards before , but I have been able ( without any training ) to make some basic projects with Publisher , such as gift certificates . I routinely do flyers that require clip art . So I did n't expect to have any problem with this Avery product.Avery DOES supply a contact number you can call to get help , but frankly I really dislike getting instructions over the phone , so I did not take advantage of this offer . I would have preferred some trouble shooting tips listed online or on a sheet of paper in the packet.First , I had trouble downloading the template . I gave up after eight tries in three different sessions . I finally settled for the totally blank card setup that I was able to get access to . I could not get the program to accept clip art most of the time . I had trouble getting one of the seven lines to center . When I finally was able to paste clip art onto the card , I could not control where it went AND all the copy I had set up disappeared ... never to be seen again . Some day ... many months from now , I may come back and try this again . Or I may give the product away and let someone else struggle with it . For now , I have a lot of wasted time and no business cards to show for it .	-1
I like the clean edge cards . The only thing I do n't like doing , and I 've had to do this on other busincess card paper , was to trim the edges with a cutter . Every time . The calibration did n't work for me and I followed the instructions as written.If you do n't mind having to trim them further , than what you need , either that , or do n't use any color near the edges . Because you may get a white strip that has to be cut .	-1
I expected better from Avery . They are okay - but pages do not slide in easily - it seems like it will work better for smaller pages ...	-1
My prior boss opened a REC Center for kids with special needs . I purchased this velcro with high hopes . I was so excited to utilize the clear velcro for communication books . Unfortunately , the velcro barely stuck to surfaces and the hard and soft velcro barely stuck to each other . I was embarrassed by this purchase .	-1
While the idea of using something environmentally friendly appeals to me , this item is not manufactured well . I put them together as I have every other box like this , and the ones I had absolutely did not stand up to use . I put my files in ( which honestly were n't very heavy ) and the box could n't take it . I ran out and bought the original ones and they held up fine . I definitely do not recommend these !	-1
I needed an accordion file folder for my classroom to handily file extra papers , assignments , handouts , lecture notes etc . on a daily basis . The ColorLife Expanding File caught my eye , as blue is my school 's color . On both of those criteria ( filing , and color ) the Wilson Jones gets an & # 34 ; A & # 34 ; . However , in one area it falls short.The velcro closure is w-a-a-a-y to tight . Opening the file necessitates bending the top , yanking the top , pulling the top - all resulting in some frustration and creases in the top . I just leave it open . I understand that the velcro strip was placed fairly high to accommodate the file as it expands . But if you simply use this as I do , for relatively few documents at a time , the shallow file results in maximum velcro attachment and frustration.This would have resulted in the file being a 3-star product . But the amazon selling price of $ 18.95 is simply too steep for this quality , resulting in the subtraction of one star , and a 2-star rating.Disappointing .	-1
This blue cardboard accordion file folder is okay . Completely function for what it is - an expanding storage unit for limited amounts of paperwork . There 's a folder for most letters of the alphabet , with a few doubling up - a total of twenty folders . This is n't something you 'd want to overstuff , simply because it 's not the sturdiest unit of its kind . The closeable flap is embarrassingly thin and prone to tearing as a result.The main issue with this product is that you do not get a very good value for your money . For this price , you 'd think Wilson Jones could 've made the file out of thin plastic rather than bendable , wearable , rip-able cardboard .	-1
Eight-page tabbed dividers can be surprisingly expensive , so this set can be a frugal choice as long as you are aware of its limitations.The multicolored tabs are of sturdy , semi-transparent plastic . The cardstock inserts are similarly rugged . However , the 8.5x11 dividers themselves are surprisingly flimsy . Although the weight of the stock is n't specified , it is comparable to multipurpose laser-printer paper . Even worse , the reinforcements surrounding the ring punch-outs -- the portions of each page subject to the greatest and most frequent stress -- have very little reinforcement.The portion of this eight-page set I used daily -- and gently -- lasted less than a week before tearing . The dime-store version I used in the rest of that binder survived much better , although the tab clarity was less satisfactory . The remaining pages of the set have survived about five weeks ' delicate and infrequent use , but there 's obvious wear at the site of the rings.Bottom line , if you are considering these for routine school or office use , keep looking . They are acceptable only for one- or maybe two-inch binders that receive just occasional use .	-1
This is a very basic set of dividers , the sort you would use in a school binder to separate your notes for each subject . I needed something like this for a binder of printed sewing technique articles -- -I wanted to divide them according to type : zippers , pockets , embroidery , etc.PROS* It will keep your papers or notes separated within a binder . * There are eight colored tabs , so you can assign a different color to each subject , like red for Math , green for Geography , yellow for Literature , and so forth . ( Hooray for color coordination ! ) In theory , the tabs stick out beyond your papers , so you can easily flip to the section you want.CONS* Remember that theory I just mentioned about the tabs sticking out ? Yeah . In reality , they do n't . Maybe if you 're only dividing notepaper , but I have a bunch of binder pockets that hold my articles . The tabs do NOT stick out past the edges of the binder pockets , so they 're virtually worthless . * These dividers are incredibly flimsy . They 're made from a slightly-thicker-than-usual paper . You do n't even get cardstock , just thick paper , with a narrow section that 's barely reinforced at the holes . I ca n't imagine they would hold up under gentle home use , never mind what a busy student would put them though . I certainly would n't use them without reinforcing each hole with some of those round stickers you can buy for repairing torn holes . Of course , those are ugly . . . . * Also , the tabs are very small . It comes with a sheet of perforated labels that you can hand write your subject title on , but they 're tiny . Personally , I would have a hard time writing the labels.I 'm giving this product two stars , because it 's barely functional . If you need something ultra cheap and flimsy , it will work just fine . But if you need something more substantial , I 'd suggestAvery Style Edge Insertable Plastic Dividers , 8-Tab Set . They 're only slightly more money , yet a lot sturdier and they look nicer , too .	-1
These dividers are pretty basic . They have plastic tabs which you can insert custom labels into ( though you have to write on them by hand or create your own custom template without any help from the manufacturer ) . The dividers are not particularly thick nor thin and they do have a somewhat reinforced edge . They are essentially quite basic . This is not necessarily a problem , but you can get a slightly better set of 8 dividers made by Avery with color tabs from OfficeMax for $ 1.39 . This set is $ 2.56 at present . The Avery ones have a better system for holding the color plastic tabs , better reinforcement along the edge , and a system for making sure the tabs do n't fall out . If you 're making a big order on Amazon for office supplies and do n't want to buy separate dividers , then it probably would n't hurt to pile this into an order , but , if you shop around , you can do better .	-1
I bought a new home office chair that turned out to have an uncomfortable seat . I bought this cushion , thinking it would be as comfortable as my memory foam mattress . Not close . Not only was there no noticeable change in comfort , this pad is unusually small -- not really standardized for the average work or dining chair . I suppose they have to size it to fit the smallest seat , but it really missed the mark .	-1
I have seen several incredibly comfortable office chairs for about $ 25 . Who would pay this for a chair pillow ?	-1
I really should have returned it earlier . It is like sitting on a rock and hurts like heck . I do n't recommend this for anyone but a featherweight ... and yes like everyone else mine says in bold letters ASTAR . At first it was good but as the weeks go on it gets worse i.e . harder and harder . Stay AWAY .	-1
The `` original '' old Mead Composition Book is a classic . But recently Mead changed the Composition Book so that it 's now worthless . The paper seems like it is n't 100 % pure quality tree paper so it 's not as smooth to write on , the cover is a messy `` plastic-type '' cardboard , the black tape comes off in 3 months . I hate these things now.I bought 50 of these `` new type '' Mead Composition Books and the 10 new ones that I still have left , have rotted and the black tape has warped and come off . The 40 that I used up with writing , have also rotted and the black tape has come off . It 's a real mess if you store them in old bookshelves . Some are made in India or Brazil and none are no longer made in the USA . The USA ones were the absolute best , with real tree paper , not `` plastic-wax type '' mesh waste paper , and real tree cardboard covers.If you need fairly adequate paper to write on , get Japanese Stationery ( ex : Apica Notebooks ) , Rhodia , Rediform DaVinci Notebooks , Leuchtturm Notebooks , Black n ' Red Notebooks , or Clairefontaine , they 're very good and of high quality . The paper is of a high standard.Also , Moleskine Cahier Large Ruled Notebook ( set of 3 ) and Writersblok Medium Ruled Notebook ( set of 3 ) , are good substitutes , of higher quality , for the Mead Black Composition Book if you 're a writer like I am . It costs more but if you 're a writer who needs decent paper to write on , it 's well worth it.If you 're just using the Mead Black Composition Book for school notes , doodling or odd ends , it 's at least useable with a good pen.The `` original '' old Mead Composition Book did n't need to be changed .

The plastic protective slip over the holes on the papers falls off , leaving the paper vulnerable to being torn.Absolute waste of money . DO NOT BUY this !	-1
I liked the old Bic ball point pens because the ink never smeared and the pens did n't leak in my purse , backpack , or bag . If I accidentally marked my clothes , the ink would wash right out . The new gel versions smear , leak , and leave a horrible mess in my purse . It does n't wash out of clothes either . Threw them away .	-1
I found that these pens did not write well . I would not recommend them even for a filler item as often I find air bubbles in the ink and have to scribble several times while I am writing . These went in the trash .	-1
I 'm a writer and handwrite all my books so I 've used many brands of pens over the years , including other types of Bic pens , and at first I was impressed with these . The color was consistent , the pen was lightweight , and they write smooth every time . I often forget to put the caps back on these and they 've never dried out nor have I needed to scribble on a piece of scrap paper to get the ink flowing.However , after using them for a few days , I started to notice that there were constant ink globs that I had to keep wiping off the end of the tip or risk smearing what I was writing . I had to keep a tissue next to me while writing so I could wipe off the end every few minutes ! Not only that , but the ink kept staining my fingers when a small glob would come off the end and it is VERY hard to get this ink off skin . It even got under my fingernail , which is even harder to wash off . Aside from the constant globs and stained fingers , these pens also need comfort grips . Bottom line , splurge on some more expensive pens that you do n't have to keep wiping off ! These are going in the trash !	-1
If you are a fan of soft feel retractable pens , you will probably like these ones . They work fine.But have you tried their older cousin , the classic BiC Cristal Stics ( and I mean *classic , * like 1959 classic ) ? They are cheap-looking , ultra-simple pens , so they may not have graced your hand if you ( like me ) thought that a pen needs to be `` soft feel '' or `` rubber gripped '' to be comfortable . But then you 'd be ( like I was ) missing the genius of these pens.The classic BiC 's were designed exceptionally , like bizarrely well . And I do n't mean in a quaint , historical way . In a modern way -- no , in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC 's adhere magnificently to principles of space , form , structure , density , and gravity . Because of their hexagonal shape , they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength ( try snapping one ) , and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability . A tiny hole drilled in the barrel 's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen . Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy . The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper , the ink slides out cleanly and , well , ... perfectly . It 's not only one of the most inexpensive pens ( less than $ 1.50 for a pack of 10 ) , it 's also probably the most efficient pen , with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words ( or about 2 novels ) . Hopefully this helps you understand why , when describing the classic BiC 's , I am comfortable using the word `` masterpiece . `` And hopefully this helps you understand why , in comparison , clunky and over-designed `` soft feel '' pens seem somewhat repulsive.Sorry if I come off as a pen snob .	-1
Writes well . My impression when I first wrote with it was that it was really smooth.Maybe it 's the wideness and grip that dampens the writing compared to a full plastic , thin stick pen ? But this thing , the Bic Soft Feel , has a major problem . The thing is press fitted together instead of screwed . So the tip slides itself into the barrel as you 're writing and you have press the two halves of the barrel back into each other after every 3 words you write.I guess you could super glue it together ... and perhaps not all of them have this problem ... but that 's my experience and it 's totally unacceptable.Update : No , they all have the automatic disintegration feature .	-1
It 's easy to fall in love with the Pilot V5 if you have never used a fluid rollerball before . The ink flows out so readily , and it maintains a steady output until it dies . But those two features are true of almost any fluid rollerball ( fluid rollerballs having a free-flowing ink tank , not a marker-style sponge pressed against the back side of the ball ) .Aside from having chosen to make a pen in that category , Pilot is n't offering anything special here . The ball tip is among the crudest on the market , and no description of its construction could include the words `` quality '' or `` precision '' . Much like the BIC Triumph , the V5 ensures ink flow through its poorly-manufactured tip by using a very loose , rattling ball . It is n't just noisy , it has an inconsistent feel against the paper.If you like rollerball pens , and particularly if you like the V5 , try a Uni-Ball Vision instead ( a series with several models ) . Uni-Ball 's Vision series uses a fluid ink system much like the V5 , but produces free-flowing ink by using a ball tip which is manufactured accurately . It feels smoother , makes much less noise , and has a more stable tip which is less prone to wiggling and bending .	-1
I purchased a set of these pens at Target roughly a week ago.When I am writing with this pen it has an inconsistent flow of ink , half way through a work it & # 34 ; dries up & # 34 ; the next work it runs dark , and repeats this process . I have tried both pens and have the same issue . Regardless if I use more/less pressure , change the angle , write on different paper.The pen writes poorly . Would not recommend or purchase these.Still searching for that perfect pen ...	-1
Just not a fan of big , oversized , wide-body pens . If you have hands like frying pans , then this may be your pen . On the plus side , I do like the rubber grip , and the fact that the pen takes the G2 Ultra-Fine gel refill . The click action is very smooth and solid .	-1
I love the ultra fine point of these refills , but I think the tips may just be too small . After about two weeks , both of the pens stopped working . The heads got clogged and I could n't use either of them . I now use the .05 pens and they 're great . They write about the same and the difference in the two is n't worth it for me .	-1
I needed a sharpener at home for my kids and the various sizes of pencils they use . This thing is good in theory , but poor in practice . Every single pencil that is sharpened in this machine comes out with one side sharpened , one side pointed wood . A big disappointment . I paid more for mine than here on Amazon.I also tried battery operated kind made by the same company ... not enough power . Now I am looking at the grand daddy of pencil sharpeners ... electric ! I think I will skip the X acto brand though .	-1
Very slim pencil , hard to hold and slippery . The lead point keeps breaking , and the quality is clearly lacking . As a comparison , I ordered the Pilot G-2/07 mini mechanical pencils from Amazon , and they are GREAT . Do n't waste your money on this product , and buy the Pilots instead .	-1
These pencils used to be great . Now they must be made with some kind of plastic or something in them -- they feel weird , smell weird , and do n't even sharpen right . How does a pencil company get THAT wrong ?	-1
They seem well made , but as you try to sharpen them , the lead breaks . The first one I sharpened took me down to half the length to get it to not break , but only because I did not sharpen it to the tip . I was using a hand-held sharpener , so maybe trying a different type will yield different results .	-1
After reading reviews of the Paper Mate Mirado , I was looking forward to a good quality wood pencil . The first pencil out of the box sharpened without issue . The graphite is smooth ... not too hard and not too soft , just right . The eraser works well , although the real test is whether it stays supple over time.However , when I sharpened the second pencil , the tip kept breaking off without ever achieving a point . Each time it broke , I checked the sharpener to make sure it was not clogged . After 4 or 5 broken tips , the pencil never reached a point.Then I figured out the problem . The graphite is not in the center of the wood . Therefore , that pencil ca n't be sharpened , except maybe free-hand.However , the tip of another pencil kept breaking . That one sharpened OK , but I can see that the wood around the lead is uneven.I like the smoothness of the lead , but the sharpening and breaking tips are too problematic . Not sure if I received a bad batch or if the box was dropped in transit.PROS : - Smooth writing tip- Eraser seems good so far- Reasonable priceCONS : - Tip of the pencil with a non-centered graphite keeps breaking.- Another pencil tip keeps breaking .	-1
These would be ok , but do n't really like the grip of the black part of the pencil . Too soft for me !	-1
This is the electric pencil sharpener issued by the Seattle School District to all classrooms . After three years , the experience taught me to appreciate the manual ones that were used by teachers for decades . Here is a listing of my complaints : .1 . It chews up pencils fast..2 . It breaks down after a one year usage..3 . The District buys it at $ 25 each and provides one for every classroom . When it breaks down , the building suppose to buy replacements . Unfortunately because of reduced budgets , none are ever purchased . As a result , teachers use their own money and buy traditional manual pencil sharpeners . They are cheaper , durable , and more reliable than this electrical power device .	-1
I 'm a third-year law student , which pretty much means I 'm an expert on highlighters . These highlighters dried out pretty quickly compared to other brands , like Sharpie and hi-liters . I did like these better than some others because I did n't have a hard time reading the text under the coloring , unlike some brands ( eg the blue and green in the Sharpie brand ) .	-1
I do n't expect highlighters to be super florescent but these do n't even make an attempt . Green and blue are way to dark and make the highlighted text difficult to read .	-1
These used to work great on textbooks , for highlighting a whole row of text ( not just underline , but solidly through the text ) . But after the chisel tip , it is too wide to highlight a row of text . Using the side of the tip , then it is too thin . The old style of these highlighters did n't have the chisel tip , and the side of the tip is just perfect for textbooks . Now I have to use the pen-style liquid accent highlighters ( [ ... ] ) , and they run out very quickly , and they cost one dollar each , instead of 59 or 69 cents big ones which could last several time longer than the pen-style ones .	-1
I usually use the same brand and model , but the yellow highlighter . I wanted to get this green one so I can differentiate between main ideas/categories and sub-ideas in my textbook , unfortunately , my pen scanner gives me errors with the green highlights . Does n't matter if I underline with it , or highlight the line completely with it . I believe it is too dark of a green which causes these errors . Thankfully , it only affected 1 chapter in which I tried it with . I guess I 'll have to try a lighter color .	-1
the highlighting is so weak from these highlighters they are essentially unusable . Considering that Sharpie is usually the best brand for markers , I suspect these are drying out from shelf life . I should have sent them back but was too overwhelmed by other pressures .	-1
The rings crush easily on this . I bought it because my son needed a two inch three ring binder for sixth grade . He 's not particularly tough on his school supplies , but this survived less than one month .	-1
As one of those people who `` thumb through '' my folders , I like the reinforcement along the top 1 '' edge of these folders . It keeps the folders standing up straight , for better visibility.But these folders ... .I 've never seen such a mess . I thought I was imagining things when I noticed they were n't sitting uniformly in my folders . Now that I take them all out and look at them from several angles , I see that these folders are not all the same height ! In fact , only one third of them are all the same height . The rest are within a 1/4 inch of each other up or town.Two folders are very roughly cut , which might indicate the `` cutter '' was off on the assembly line . Or they have n't gotten all the kinks worked out for this product.As it is , I 've wasted a sheet of labels and must re-start a tedious job . I will give away these folders , as they are unusable for my purposes.Even if they had n't been defective , I was shocked by how flimsy the paper is .	-1
I use a LOT of file folders on the job , so I have become somewhat of an file folder aficionado . : - ) Pros : - Wire Fastener are well made/sturdy- Tabs at top of folder are reinforced ( paper is doubled over and glued down well ) - Bright colors- 3 tab positions in every colorCons : - VERY thin folders ! I was expecting MUCH thicker material for the price . These are on the thinner side of EVERY file folder I 've used at different prices.- Thinness of folder makes the fasteners more prone to ripping the folder , especially if you flip the papers that are fastened up ( i.e. , if you 're reading the BOTTOM page , the folder becomes very unstable , bends , or can rip ) - Must use on a desk or table -- folder is so thin that you 'll likely need to put it on a desk or table to flip through the fastened-on papers , because the folder is n't strong enough to be stable if you 're standing up while reading the bottom few pages . The whole folder can bend over or even rip the fastening clip off of the folder if you flip the paper up to read something.Overall , I was disappointed . I have never , ever seen fastening-clip style folders like this made out of such a THIN material ! They would be perfectly fine for folders that are rarely used ... though in my experience , people generally want fastening folders like this for HEAVILY used folders , or folders that are moved around a lot , read through while standing at the filing cabinet , etc ... and these wo n't hold up to much use at all . Why take the extra time to clip everything in place so carefully , if the folder is just going to rip on you ? ` These are fine for 'file and forget about it ' files , but I think people generally are n't bothering to punch holes and clip documents in unless they intend to use that file quite a bit/carry it around with them . These wo n't stand up to much of ANY use , let alone heavy abuse ! They would be great if they 'd only bothered to use a halfway decent , heavier weight paper/cardboard to make the folder out of . Or at least they could have reinforced the cardboard around the area of the fastener ( as they did on the tab ) . Only order these if they 're very inexpensive AND you only intend to put rarely used files in them .	-1
Quality is not too great . Not that sturdy and stong . It feels kind of like regular paper . However , it still gets the job done .	-1
While this tape is a tiny bit thicker than the standard Scotch packaging tape , I ca n't see that it is really worth the higher price . As with all new products , I like to try them out exactly how the directions say before doing things my way , and the directions for repairing a paperback book are pretty much useless . The tape rips easily , so trying to make precision cuts with a normal pair of scissors was basically impossible for me to do without the tape simply ripping the whole way across . What `` tabs '' did manage to not tear off were of no use repairing the book in question , so I quickly abandoned the suggested way and did my own thing . I am thoroughly not impressed with the product and am very disappointed in its quality , especially considering the price .	-1
We recently remodeled a room which included painting and since I had this tape to try I gave it a go even though we normally use Frog Tape . Application was easy enough , but when it came time to remove it after painting it was a disaster . Not only did some of it stick which made it very difficult to remove small pieces , it also bled underneath . I would have tried using it again , but the once was frustrating enough . So while there are other good uses for this tape , I 'm sure ; painting is not one of them and I would discourage it .	-1
By far one of the strongest fulfillment tapes I 've ever used . My only issue -- I had to change the blade in my tape gun in order to cut it , and even with a new blade , if I did n't cut it cleanly on the first attempt , I had to grab a scissors.Edit : Not long after I originally reviewed this tape , I put together a box that I ended up not using . Not wanting to cut the tape to refold the box for storage , I just left it sit taped-up . Well , today I needed to use that box.Unfortunately what I found is that the tape was curling-up , and not fully adhering to the box any longer . It 's a bad thing when a shipping tape does n't permanently stick to cardboard , so I need to downgrade my rating.My advice is to make sure any place you use this tape on the box , you encircle the box so the tape can adhere to itself . Do not expect it to adhere very well to the cardboard .	-1
The 1 '' wide scotch magic tape I wanted has a 3 '' diameter core . This dispenser is for tape with a 1 '' diameter core . I had to buy a more expensive 3 '' diameter office dispenser ( which I really like )	-1
I purchased my first Scotch tape dispenser in 1974 and it lasted for 37 years . It was built like a rock- solid composition , almost as heavy as marble.This item cracked and started to spill out sand after it was bumped on the countertop . It is constructed of 2 pieces of lightweight plastic glued together with sand inside to weigh the dispenser down.I only paid 2.50 for the item , no big loss , but I would of preferred a more durable unit even if it costs more .	-1
This tape dispenser is not heavy . One can not remove tape without holding the dispenser . Fortunately , I have one that is 40 years old that IS heavy . Do n't buy this one no matter how inexpensive it is .	-1
The design of these particular tapes is such that if you have text in more than one line , such as I do on my desk calendar , and try to use it directly underneath the line you just & # 34 ; whited out & # 34 ; the plastic on the dispenser will scrape off what you just covered . For me this is a deal breaker as it completely undermines the purpose that I had in mind when I purchases it .	-1
I picked up several of these when they were on sale because they were BIC . The first one was nothing but a pain , and the tape kept breaking , much like a cassette tape and just as useless afterward ( for those of us who remember cassettes ) . I thought maybe it was just a problem with that particular one , but I 've been through all of them , and they were all just as bad . If I managed to make it halfway through without the tape breaking , the white stuff began to flake off the clear film on most of them also rendering them useless . As much as I put the fluid type corrector at the bottom of my list , I 'd rather use that than use these again . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I 've bought 4 of these now , and each one has malfunctioned after one or two uses . Nor am I able to put the things back together because they are so cheaply made . I will never buy another Bic Wite-out again , nor do I reccommend you waste your money . Wite-out never responds to complaints either .	-1
Poor new design , it breaks , it has no screw for rewind . Tombo Mono is a better brand , it still has the screw for rewind . Bic has no way to open or adjust the tape .	-1
I use a lot of colored ink for my math homework notes and needed some correction tape so I blindly bought this off amazon for the good reviews.There were too many times where the tape would actually rip and shred while trying to use it . It would do this so much that I would go off on a tangent and try to go over the same spot again and again and again trying to get all the tape to work properly which it rarely did.I went to a local store to see if any other brands of correction tape was available and found a blue colored BIC correction tape . It worked beautifully . Very smooth and proper function where the tape does n't shred and starts where you want it on the paper.I definitely recommend the BIC brand over this one . Save yourself the pain .	-1
I returned it twice , thinking that it was just a lemon ... but this brand is not good . Find another brand instead .	-1
Have 2 kids going through the schools . I wish I 'd thought of looking for these erasers in Amazon before they went through endless packs of Staples erasers . These are actually better . They erase well . No glazing or becoming smudged . Tighter fit on the pencils as well.4-25-2014 edit : After a few months . Some of the erasers are splitting down the middle . It is happening to at least 1 out of 3 erasers . Am I or my kids bearing down on it too much ? Maybe . But it is laughable to have to walk on eggshells to use the eraser . There is still a boxful left . Will see what happens with the rest of them.These erasers do not deserve only 2 stars ( my choice would be 3 ) , but I put it there where it will not be lost in the 5 star reviews . Buyers be aware .	-1
This listing was posted as a pack ( of 12 ) sharpies , but was shipped as single sharpies . When customer support was contacted , they reported that Amazon made the listing mistake and they ( the company ) were not responsible for this error . The quality of the items were good , but overall this was a terrible experience .	-1
I 've been trying to mark corrugated boxes for storage and the chisel point creates and inconsistent line on a corrugated box . I 'm sure it would be beautiful on poster board , but I do n't need it for that . I used to do calligraphy so I do n't really think I have a problem with skill with a chisel point . A lot of people use these markers for boxes and I would like to see the nice , neat lettering I 'm actually writing with . I 've been using Sharpie King Size markers for years without a bit of trouble and I guess you ca n't get then now without the chisel point . So , back to Marks-A-Lot .	-1
These pens have a nice fine permanent point . I use them in my artwork . BUT they stop working FAST , get clogged or skip frequently -- so I ordered this well priced BOX anticipating that . On my first use , the pen quit working in 5 minutes . It got clogged or ? , as there was no way I used up all the ink that fast . I had to keep sucking ink out with an absorbing kleenex to get ink flowing again . I like the permanent ink line -- but it is a hassle for artwork . when writing , if you angle the tip for a normal writing position , it does n't work too well either.The design could use some work . *update July 2013 : EVERY SINGLE pen stopped working within HOURS of opening it . They run DRY , skip , and are generally a royal pain . NEVER will buy these again . I think they are cheap because somebody got old stuff to re-sell . WHY else would every pen go dry in a matter of hours , capped or not ? BUY something else ! Aloha	-1
runny ; ca n't control ink spreading into surrounding spaces , would return if I had the packaging	-1
I was very disappointed with the plastic this is made from . If you were to open a box of cookies , the plastic in that is just as thick . It has one thin strip of double sided tape on the back to mount it . We returned ours and bought a magnetic basket to hold the markers . It cost less and was much nicer .	-1
I was really suprised that Swingline would make such a cheap product . First off I thought that the look of it was nice-it has a shiny look to it but then when I touched it I realized that it was made of some sort of cheap plastic . And even worse-when I loaded it with staples it kepts jamming . I tried using it for 2 , 5 , 10 and 15 pages ( it claims that it can handle up to 15 per staple ) and each time it jammed up even two pages ! I had to use a stapler removal to get the mangled staple out of my documents.Spend a little more and get one that wo n't jam as much as this piece of junk did ! Skip !	-1
I have a Swingline Standard Stapler and have had it in my office for a number of years . It was cheap and looked nice but has n't worked nearly as well as the older , cruder model it replaced . Although looking rather attractive it is nowhere nearly as sturdy as my previous stapler . It jams off and on and sometimes gets the staple stuck to where it requires a pliers to remove it . It works fairly well with up to six pages , but beyond that it struggles . I would not regard it as a quality office instrument . There are better staplers available , although they might cost more.Gary Peterson	-1
This is your standard stapler , with biodegradable plastic , treated with Microban , and takes standard size staples . It 's lightweight . However , the first time the top was opened for loading staples and somehow the loading spring broke . So- I 've never been able to actual use it because the spring that holds the staples in place just & # 34 ; floats & # 34 ; back and forth without tension . Very disappointing .	-1
I am generally a huge fan of swingline products , but this stapler is not the best out there . It is budget friendly which is a plus , lightweight and ergonomic made with 50 % recycled plastics so its a bit greener than others on the market . We use it at the office daily , it works pretty well with two sheet stapling , which is what we use it for primarily . But , when you go to 8-10 pages it jams although it is supposed to do 15 . Overall a bummer as the price is very economical .	-1
It seems like these staplers are getting more flimsy each year . This one has very light weight plastic and very lightweight metal . When you pick it up , it feels like a very low quality product . I did not get good results with it and am not happy with it . I would suggest spending a little more and getting a more solidly built model .	-1
I bought this because it says pink . What i received is not pink . It is not the purple one , either . The part number is correct , but it is in between and very close to a purple sort of magenta . It 's not anything like the picture , and , yes , my monitor is color-calibrated so do n't blame it on my screen . If you are looking for pink , pass on this item .	-1
The following 4-star paragraph , written in January 2012 , has been edited into past tense to reflect both this product 's potential and its incredibly short lifespan : This little bitty stapler had a lot going for it : Came with its own little box of 1,000 green-colored staples that fit all standard-size staplers . Came in two very loud colors so that , tiny though it was , it would have been easy to find on even the messiest desk . Plus which , it came with a key chain attached . And attached to the key chain was a belt hook , which I hooked onto my pencil jar , making it easy to find amid clutter . I 'd have much preferred to choose my own color combination from Swingline 's pretty good selection ; would have gladly paid a buck or two more if given that option , especially since the one they sent me is yellow & orange , which would have been my absolute last choice had I had one . Also , it arrived from the Amazon outside seller just a couple of days after I ordered it.UPDATE 3/2/12 : Quit working after 30 days . Spent two days trying to get it to release a staple . Could n't do it . So came back here and deducted two of its original four stars . And then discovered I was not alone in all this . Ah , well . You get what you pay for , I guess . And mostly what I got was about 950 green staples that can be used in my not-cute-but-nonetheless-functional stapler .	-1
I had hoped this would help opening the volumes of business mail we get daily . While it works good on a lot of things , unfortunately it cuts whatever the contents is way too frequently so I have to take the time to tape whatever it is back together . I have to be cautious what I open with it so not to destroy any critical documents . It opens the envelope ok but by cutting off way too much of the envelope creating this problem . I would not re-order for business purposes which is unfortunate because it was priced good and it is very portable .	-1
I bought this set of pens expecting them to write for a while before they dried up . One pen out of a dozen wrote , and then only for a short time . It 's like they had been out in the sun or something and just dried up . I have never shipped anything back to Amazon , but these I returned . I quickly got a credit for the return ; I was impressed with the speed of the return and the fact I did n't have to pay return shipping . Thanks Amazon for making good on a product that could have been a good one had it not been defective .	-1
If you are a fan of gel pens , you will probably like these Pilots ( minus the occasional smearing or ink stoppages ) . It used to be my go-to pen because of its comfortable grip and its smooth , even lines.But then one time I was forced to use a classic BiC Cristal Stic ball point pen ( and I mean *classic , * like 1959 classic ) , and I found that I actually , well ... liked it . A lot . In fact , I began to like the BiC 's so much that I found myself writing paragraphs like the next one.The classic BiC 's were designed exceptionally , like bizarrely well . And I do n't mean in a quaint , historical way . In a modern way -- no , in a *timeless* way -- the classic BiC 's adhere magnificently to principles of space , form , structure , density , and gravity . Because of their hexagonal shape , they require minimal plastic while also retaining a surprising strength ( try snapping one ) , and the hexagonal grip points give the pens impressive writing stability . A tiny hole drilled in the barrel 's body keeps the air pressure the same both inside and outside the pen . Gravity feeds the thick ink down a tube to a free-spinning ball bearing that was manufactured within a fraction of a micron of accuracy . The result is that when the pen is pressed against paper , the ink slides out cleanly and , well , ... perfectly . It 's not only one of the most inexpensive pens ( less than $ 1.50 for a pack of 10 ) , it 's also probably the most efficient pen , with a single pen able to write over 100,000 words ( or about 2 novels ) . Hopefully this helps you understand why , when describing the classic BiC 's , I am comfortable using the word `` masterpiece . `` And hopefully this helps you understand why , in comparison , clunky and over-designed gel pens seem somewhat abhorrent .	-1
I think I will just stick with the regular Pilot G2 pens ( do NOT buy the cheaper imitations , they are terrible ) . These `` bold '' pens seemed nice at first , but I found that I always ended up with ink splotches on my papers , fingers ... pants , shirts ... nose ... .	-1
I did not buy this from amazon , just a local store , but I did buy it based on the good reviews on amazon . For me , writing with this pen is not very smooth , also there are times when the ink does not come out at consistently . I no longer want to use this pen at all because of it .	-1
I was disappointed because I was expecting to get larger flags and they are about the size of a large paperclip .	-1
ENOUGH TO WRITE YES OR NO ! ! THIS IS NOT FOR NOTES . TERRIBLE DESCRPITION OF THIS PRODUCT . WHY DON ; T YOU SAY IT IS TINY PAPER . SAY IT AS YOU SEE IT .	-1
Electric staplers do not work as well and are not as reliable as manuals . They require electricity to work and fail after a year 's usage .	-1
papers MUST be pulled straight and taught with both your hands before it triggers . Sometimes you can get away with a one handed stapling but usually you sit there jamming it in and out 10+ times before it detects it.oh , and it is LOUD . Ridiculously loud piercing snap with a ring afterwards . The loudest thing that ever happens in the office is this stapler . the whole office can hear it . Tried dampening the noise with dynamat , did n't help at all.Staplers should be easy , not hard . This is simple stuff , I thought this was a premium product to make my office a bit nicer but no.I even tried buying `` premium '' staples that cost 5x as much and come in a special little tin , that did n't help . Tried cleaning it with q-tips , nothing works.donotbuy	-1
Visibly curls in my small laser printer . Paper has a yellow tint to it . Better than some paper that has a visible blue tint , but it is definitely not white.The paper never jammed , but I 've never once had a paper jam so not sure that 's worth too much.Paper is way too thin though ! With a report stacked up and placed on a solid surface , text from page 3 can be seen on page 1 . Held up to a light source , print from page 6 is visible on page 1 . It is definitely not suitable for a presentation .	-1
I read the reviews but seeing the overwhelming amount of 5 star reviews , I took a chance and purchased this . I should have known better , this is NOT photo paper . Like everyone else , I agree this is nothing but card stock . The photos came out very rough looking and faded within a few months . Would not suggest purchasing this to anyone . Gon na let my kids use the rest for drawing !	-1
I thought I could save money by printing some photos on this less expensive matte photo paper . Big mistake . Quality is so poor that I 'm ready to just dump it . Ca n't figure what else to use it for .	-1
As soon as I saw the box I noticed it had a water stain on it.Opened the box and half the folders were damp and smelled like cat Pee Pee ! It did not happen in shipping ! Need I say more .	-1
I would suggest another brand . First thing is the plastic itself is not clear to begin with , poor design or Quality control.Used multiple times but still got either bubbles or not very good contact between the two pieces .	-1
There are n't a whole lot of things to say about a tape dispenser . This one is clearly meant for small jobs and if you are sealing a lot of boxes this one will only lead to frustration . First of all the cheap design of it means you have to hold the cylinder on the sides . This also means they ca n't include much tape since your hand has to fit around the entire piece . The tape was suitably sticky to seal my box but when I cut the tape with the serrated edge it would snap back onto the roll every time which means I have to go back and use my fingernails to peal it back off the roll . For a single box or even several boxes this might not be a big deal but if you planning on moving and have a lot of boxes pulling the tape back off the roll each time will get really old . I also had a problem with the tape tearing when I was pulling it back off the roll however I 've never seen a tape dispenser that did n't have that problem . On the other hand if it did n't snap back onto the roll each time I would n't have to worry about it tearing.Scotch claims that this is refillable but God only knows how you get a new roll of tape on since it fits over a solid plastic axle and it has the look and feel of something disposable . This is clearly intended for the budget conscious customer but for my money I 'd spend a little extra to get a quality tape dispenser with a handle that actually is reusable and can hold more than this tiny roll of tape .	-1
I found this product very hard to use . To start the tape I had to struggle with the tape to get is started and lost a lot of tape in the beginning because it would not start properly and only half the tape came off . Then I had to struggle to keep the tape flowing as I taped a box together . Being a former Army wife I have moved many times and have used packaging tape more times than I would like to think about and this tape was the worst I have seen . It is too bulky , hard to start , hard to remove protective cardboard from blade . All in all I would not buy this tape dispenser again .	-1
This tape does deliver on its `` tear by hand '' promise and it works as well as the Scotch traditional packaging tape.Scotch Packaging Tape , 2 Inches x 800 Inches , 6 Rolls ( 142-6 ) . It is more convenient to use and store not requiring a dispenser with its sharp edge or grabbing for a pair of scissors . However it does cost substantially more , 2 1/2 times more than the regular packaging tape . If you only use tape infrequently or if the cost is not a consideration you would be quite happy with the performance of this tape.Update 3/21/2014 I still had some of this roll and when I wet to use it for shipping a package I found this tape has lost most of its ability to stick and easily peels off so it is useless now .	-1
Update , June 2011 : Would lower the stars if I could . I have discovered that this tape simply will not adhere well to a surface that is not firm and flat ( such as cardboard ) . It popped right off padded envelopes . Not good . I 'm sticking to the packaging tape that I buy at Costco. -- -I received a sample 16-yard roll of this product for evaluation via the Amazon Vine program . I was very interested in checking out this tape as I send packages overseas quite frequently.Yes , this does seem to be good tape , albeit a bit on the thin side . Yes , you can tear it by hand . ( It splits easily from side to side . ) Yes , it is convenient.BUT ... and this is a big but , does the convenience of being able to tear the tape by hand justify the outrageous price - double that of other tear-by-hand tapes ? On 12/23/2010 , the price for theScotch Tear-by-Hand Tape , 1.88 Inches x 50 Yards , 2-Pack ( 3842-2 ) ( 50-yard rolls ) of this tape was $ 14.73 ( $ 7.36 per roll , 14 cents per yard ) . TheScotch Tear-by-Hand Tape , 1.88 Inches x 50 Yards , 4-Pack ( 3842-4 ) was $ 20.23 ( $ 5.05 per roll , 10 cents per yard ) .Compare that toLePage 's USPS Tear By Hand Tape , 2 x 800 Inches ( 83726 ) for $ 3.19 ( $ 1.59 per roll , 7 cents per yard ) ( available from Amazon ) .Double the price for the two-pack seems a bit much ... .	-1
These things were a pain . I tried using the avery design suite ... no luck , every time I printed it , it was all over the place . Tried using the template in word ... a hot mess . The templates just would n't line up . I print on templates ALL THE TIME . These were the worst I 've ever come across.The leftovers ... . well ... they will be great for the next yardsale , I 'll use a pen , and write in the numbers . Printing nightmare !	-1
These are fine envelopes ; but if you are buying them for the advertised security tint , they make poor security envelopes . When I sealed my check in one , not only could I tell there was a check inside , I could read the check routing numbers by holding the envelope up to the light . I had to add an extra sheet of folded white paper to hide my check .	-1
I asked my husband to buy me some packing tape today , and he brought home this product . He says he bought it because the outside label states , `` packaging tape , '' at one spot and at another it proclaims , in big bold print , `` SHIPPING . '' When you open up the plastic encasing the tape , you can also read another description , inside the cardboard `` wheel '' that the tape is mounted on : `` Scotch Sealing Tape . '' This means that the company has offered three different names for one product and , unfortunately , none are an accurate description , because here is how this tape acts:1 . When I tried to use the tape , I found it almost impossible to pry loose . Unlike every other packing tape I 've used over the years , this brand does n't have a colorful piece of light cardboard indicating the starting point and making it easy to unhook the tape.2 . When I finally got the tape unhooked and started trying to remove from the cardboard wheel a strip to wrap around a package I needed to mail , it was so weak , it tore apart after only a few inches . This caused me the incredible aggravation of once again having to try and find the starting point of the tape . Worse , the tear was that awful kind where the tape splits apart in the middle , so it creates a narrow , jagged piece with a very skinny tip that is particularly hard to see the end of.3 . Tape ripping to shreds like this is a clear indicator that it is so fragile , it is completely unsuitable as a packing tape . To give you an idea how frail it is , the tape I use in my office , of the 3/4-inch , clear variety , and even masking tape , are both far stronger than this tape.Because of these defects , I do n't recommend this tape for any use whatsoever , and I myself am going to ask for a refund.By the way , the package states that this tape is , `` Made in the USA , '' but since the company distributing the tape has made a false claim about this tape by calling it `` shipping tape , '' perhaps this claim is n't true either .	-1
This tape ended up being worthless quality and all eight rolls I bought went into the garbage . My moving helpers and I were spending way too much time babysitting these rolls of tape , which were nearly impossible to pull off the roll . We drove to Home Depot and bought several packages of brand-name package sealing tape instead .	-1
I read the negative reviews for this tape but since they were several months old , and the 3M company representative had responded to them , I took a leap of faith and hoped that Amazon 's stock had been replaced and the problem resolved.Not so . I purchased four rolls of this tape , and so far one has absolutely NO adhesion , and the other I would rate as barely sticky . I got these for a little over two dollars a roll which was a great price , but I would have been fuming if I paid the $ 6- $ 7 these cost in retail stores and had the same problems.For a company like 3M , which generally sells some of the best products , to have such a lapse in QC and allow this type of inferior product to hit the market is sad . I will not be purchasing this tape again , or any 3M brand packaging tapes for a while , in the hopes that they correct this problem .	-1
This tape is strong and clear and does n't curl up . That I like . But it is very hard to use in a dispenser gun because it is difficult to tear on the blade one-handed . Instead of tearing it just pulls out more and more tape until I have a piece much longer than I need and I have to tear it manually . So pros and cons.Update a few days later : worst tape I 've ever used ! Yes , it is strong and clear but it REFUSES to be cut in the tape gun . Maybe it is TOO strong ! I have to manually cut it every time . I wo n't buy this stuff.Further update after using it numerous times : I ca n't believe all the great reviews ! Worst packing tape I 've ever used , and I 've used TONS over many years . I will probably end up throwing them away and not even use them up due to the troublesome nature of this tape .	-1
I thought it was me until I read the other complaints about the Scotch Super Strength Tape not sticking to packages . While this may be a very strong ( labeled 20x stronger ) packaging tape , it 's not much good if it wo n't stick to the package.I had previously used an off-brand very inexpensive packaging tape and never had any problems with it not sticking . In fact the cheap tape was very sticky , so much so that if you pulled it off the package , it pulled the top layer of the cardboard with it . On the other hand , the expensive Scotch Super Strength tape pulls off any package with no problem . I am using 2-3 times as much tape ( criss-crossing it ) as I did with the cheap tape . So the Scotch ends up costing me 4-5 times as much . Overall a real reputation killer for Scotch brand products .	-1
The lead is very soft so one can not push hard or it breaks . It 's not a dark red and can . Be hard to see if not using on white paper . It does not erase easily , but you can erase it . If you are in the market for a cheaper red pencil that is light in color and fragile than this is your pick . I ca n't really say I have tried others .	-1
... or maybe the adhesive does not do so well at zero degrees F ? I bought the 10 x 13 inch envelopes because in theory they hold more pages than 9 x 12 inch envelopes . I think that is fair to expect.The problem is that the paper of the batch of envelopes that I received was so thin/weak that it ripped under the stress of having 120 pages of documents stuffed inside ( even though the capacity looked to be about twice that number of pages ) .Then with the envelope stuffed the adhesive on the already-sealed end looked like it was starting to lift . The grip-seal ( strip-seal ) did not seem to hold well.In fairness it was about zero degrees F -- many things underperform in those conditions ( including people like me ) . But it did not feel like I should be confident the envelope was going to make it to San Diego in one piece.I ended up reinforcing the entire envelope with clear shipping tape . That defeats the bargain.I expected better from Mead Westvaco . Somebody tell me I got a bad batch.Or maybe it is time to move from the frozen tundra to San Diego .	-1
I got two of these from my local Staples . Both were defective . The tabs for opening the top would not work . I actually had to search the internet to find out how they were supposed to open , as there were in instructions in the box . These came in the original packaging from 3M .	-1
I was very excited to get this all in one machine . It had all the features that I was looking for . When it printed the first test page ( the one with the billiard balls ) , I was amazed and happy . I researched this machine and read all the specs including estimated page counts for the print heads and ink cartridges . Actual use comes no where near what they put in the specs.Then 1 month later I had to get more ink , no problem . Then it just kept eating ink . I have had this machine for about 1 year , and have printed less than 2,000 pages total . The ink is very expensive , and it goes through the printheads ( which are more expensive than the ink ) very frequently . I paid $ 450+ for this machine , and have already spent about $ 350 in ink and printheads.Plus , it has broken on me twice , and had to get it replaced.Plus , I experience the same fax problems ( random error messages for no reason ) that others report in these reviewsPlus , the customer support is AWFUL . And I mean awful , you will be less frustrated if you just threw your printer out the window.I bought HP because I thought its company and products were top notch . Not the case here.I will never buy another HP Printer again.As a matter of fact , I am thinking of ditching this one because of the expense of mainenance . For the $ 350 it will cost me next year to maintain it , I may be better off buying a different printer .	-1
Found out after I unwrapped everything that this printer does n't work with Windows 2000 : ( It 's for Windoes XP and Macs ( not sure which one ) only after calling support.What a waste of time .	-1
In 6 months and less than 6,000 copies have had to have unit replaced by HP ( with refurbished units ) twice . Frequent print head failure which is expensive to replace . Ink very expensive and goes quickly . Officejet is supplied with base level Iris software so it can not print multiple copies of documents with a table or an embedded image . Can only print one page at a time.Scanning is excellent both in speed and quality . Copy quality is outstanding and speed is very good . For straight color printing cost per page is much lower for color laserjets from HP or Minolta .	-1
Be aware , that thing does n't have self adhesive . it is a bad thing to have to use your lips or tongue to sealed it ! and it is a bad too to use external source of adhesive tap each time u use it . avoid and seek the ones with self adhesive	-1
The design is all wrong ! If you want to go from page 1 to page 35 or page 50 or page 100 , be prepared not to pop the hinges and mess up the whole binder . Just horrid and I wish I had returned while I still could . Got a 3 & # 34 ; from OfficeMax that has ROUND hinges and no problems ... Extreme couponer . esdw	-1
Ok I hate to write negative reviews but these envelopes have very poor glue on the peel and stick side . I 'm putting a piece of scotch tape on everything to make sure they stay shut which kind of defeats the purpose of buying & # 34 ; Grip-Seal & # 34 ; which do n't really grip that well .	-1
I dislike intensely rulers that do n't start at zero . This one has about 1/8 '' at either end before the measurements start . I guess this is just a lazy way of making rulers to low tolerances . The model it relaced `` R590-15 was exactly 15 '' long and started and ended on the mark . Just ca n't see this with the picture , so I ordered it without knowing this .	-1
Cross has been the maker of fine writing instruments for decades . So what happened to the quality of their refills ? I purchased a fine-point two-pack for the twist pen expecting exceptional quality , and what I get is a refill that blobs ink all over my document . I guess I 'll retire my Cross pen . I get better performance from a Pilot G2 Extra fine point gel pen - two for under $ 3 .	-1
does not work at all not work at alldoes not work at all cant tell u what the problem is I mean its a friggen stapler and I thought paying more money would guarentee something that worked -- now I will have to use the one my mom swiped from work -It works plus has her name written on it so I will have to watch my ps and qs .	-1
Another sad example of Chinese junk ! ! ! The stapler made famous by its legacy on American desks and the movie Office Space is ... dead . This piece of junk was cracked because it was made of plastic , and stapled once because it 's mechanism was cheap metal that jammed . It 's not even good enough for a paperweight because the color is n't even correct or uniform ! Take my advice , either pay for the standard metal stapler , made somewhere else if possible , or hold on to the one you 've got . By the way , tried ordering a replacement , which Amazon promptly sent , only to receive another POS that was in even worse condition ! Avoid , Avoid , Avoid ! ! ! !	-1
I like the concept of a rubber bands in a convenient ball.When I first received them , I was initially pleased . Purchased in late November , it is now mid February of the following year.As I am getting thru the rubber band ball , I find they snap and break even before surrounding an object . Considering the price , I can not justify recommending them.In many cases , they do n't seem to stretch much as well .	-1
It 's a rubber band ball , full of rubber bands ... What could possibly go wrong ? Off the cuff , I 'd say somewhere between 10-20 % of them snapped ( broke ) the first time being stretched ( which hurts , but most importantly is tremendously irritating , especially when you 're in the middle of a rubber band war , thus giving your enemy the upper hand ) . It 's a fun looking piece of sculpture on your desk , fun to toss around . Just do n't try to use the rubber bands .	-1
This is an excellent cordless hands-free phone as long as you do not have any other wireless devices at home . I have been using this phone for several months now and I have a wireless G network at home . This phone completely shuts down my entire wireless network . I have tried everything from changing the channel on the wireless network to changing the channel on the phone but the problem is resolved only temporarily . It somehow changes its own channel to the same one that my wireless network is running resulting is total disruption of all computers and laptops . Not only does it interfere with my wireless network , it is also affected by microwave oven . If you are talking in the kitchen and using microwave at the same time , this phone will pick up the waves from your microwave creating so much noise that you can barely talk . I have used other cordless phones before and none of them created this kind of wireless hell that this device does . After using it for several months , the disadvantages outweigh its advantages and I am looking for a substitute .	-1
I 've been using the CT-12 for over a year . It seemed like the perfect home office phone ... portable ; hands-free , allowing the user to type and talk ; compact and comfortable . It 's caller ID-ready , has good noise reduction and has a speed dial function and mute button . In addition , Plantronics has one of the best warranties I 've ever experienced . I simply called when my first phone stopped working and they sent a new one within a couple of days , no hassle , no paperwork . So why only two stars ? First , the belt clip is inadequate ( especially for those of us who never wear belts . ) The clip is too weak to clip to jeans , so I always have to wear a shirt with a pocket in order to have a place to put the phone . This is a serious flaw , as I discovered the clip 's weakness only after the phone fell off my pants and onto the floor the first few times I tried it.Second , the number pad is frustratingly small . It is easy to misdial with keys the size of a pencil eraser.Third , and most important , the unit 's phone jack seems to have a design flaw . I am on my second phone within one year and each one has , over several months , started crackling and cutting out . At first I thought it was the headset , since holding the cord a certain way would eliminate the crackling sound . On a hunch , I bought a new headset from another manufacturer , plugged it in , and immediately started getting the crackling noise . Now that my warranty has expired , I will not be buying a replacement phone , but looking for a new manufacturer altogether . A real pity , I loved this phone .	-1
I was happy to find a phone with a mute button after my GE crapped out . This was a great phone for 2 to 3 weeks until the cord that attached the headphones starting to make a crackling noise . Also , the WiFi network card I used interferred with the phone everytime , rendering it useless while using my laptop.I so badly wanted this phone to work and work well . All other aspects were superb : large reception area , too many Caller Id stored numbers to count , great features and compact , PLUS a mute button for when one must do laundry on long conference calls from home.This phone is wonderful in theory , not so hot on actual function .	-1
The idiots who designed this made it with no clip on the cap , which I need to carry it in my pocket.Probably designed in a third world country where they do n't have pockets in what few clothes they own.It does n't say where the product was actually made . About half of the package is in some foreign language , not English.Now I know not to buy Newell Rubbermaid products ( who makes Sharpies ) .	-1
I got this to write my mom 's name on her dark clothing items . I was expecting it to write like my black ones . It does n't write well at all on fabric , so I was very disappointed . And , in addition to the tip not being firm enough while trying to write on fabric , it definitely is not writing in a fine line as the black ones I have do - it is almost like a wide point , that 's how far off it is .	-1
After having problems with the cheaper , non-OEM cartridges , I decided to go back to the HP brand . I 've always had good luck with the genuine HP product - until this one . After only several uses , one of the colors stopped working , rendering the cartridge useless . The unit was within its expiration date . I tried running the 'clean printheads ' several times with no luck.I blame it on a potential bad batch because when I visited our local big box retailer and purchased the same cartridge , at retail price , it worked fine .	-1
My husband is self-employed here at our home and was in a better position to test this item than I was , as I have to have my legs propped up at all times while sitting . Well he tried it out and felt it to be a very dangerous item as it got in the way and was easy to trip over , etc . Adjusting it for your own particular needs , he also felt to be complex and too difficult for someone sitting in a regular office without all the tools that he has handy . I 'm not sure what he did with it , but it sure is n't under his feet .	-1
Very thin and flimsy plastic . Dropped them . Several cracked and the lead in the others broke into pieces . What a waste .	-1
I 've used many three ring binders in my life and this is by far the cheapest in quality of any I 've ever used . Being that I am not keen on leaving a single star review for products , always trying to find redeeming qualities , this is one of the rare products that really is not worthy of purchase unless it can be found at a dollar store and you are desperate for a matte white binder . Mine arrived with some dirt inside the rear cover 's clear sheet and I can not for the life of me get it out . Because the material is so thin and flimsy , I will not try any more for fear of tearing it . The corners of the binder are each already bent and the cardboard structure is clearly less sturdy than any of the other binders I currently have in my home or office . The 1 1/2 inches of this binder will hold more papers than I would trust to be protected by this binder . With a basic round three ring hardware attached to the rear of the cover , I expect that a full binder would fall apart very quickly . I can not with a clear conscience recommend this binder .	-1
I received this binder with a torn corner . I 'm not sure when or how this happened , but it did let me see that the plastic cover is not thick or strong at all . It is n't the sturdiest binder I 've ever had , but if it is going to be used for something that wo n't cause too much wear and tear , it would probably be okay . I would n't buy another one like this because of the reasons posted above .	-1
These are flimsy and poorly constructed . Spend a couple dollars more and get better quality . The rings in the binder do n't close , so loose leaf paper takes on a whole different meaning . If you plan on carrying these in a backpack , forget it , you may as well use paper folders .	-1
the rings open up too easily an then after not long , they do n't even close correctly .	-1
To say this binder is basic is an understatement it is stark white with a matte plastic cover that can allow custom inserts ( project titles , etc. ) . The outer plastic is very , very thin and cheap and only one piece covers the entire binder , with no reinforcements at the seams . Honestly , I ca n't say it lasting very long and inserting an 8x10 title page on the front cover it moves around a lot , with a very loose fit , making that feature fairly useless . Even less helpful are the cheap interior plastic pockets , one of which was ripped off even before I got it.This is a dirt cheap binder , and it looks and feels it . For a few cents more there are better , longer-lasting options out there .	-1
Look , this is NOT a & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; board , because as far as I can determine , there is no real cork anywhere on the product . And the & # 34 ; graphite & # 34 ; frame also implies a quality that is nonexistent . The frame appears to be simple plastic , colored dark grey/black.The four brackets you are supposed to use to attach it to your wall , are extreme overkill and also are very difficult to attach and align . This product is very light weight , and does not need such a complicated hanging system ... Other reviewers have also had various issues with this bulletin board , including how soon the & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; surface peels , etc.Basically the price is way too high and the quality too low , and the assembly brackets are far too complicated and unnecessary.Furthermore , the artificial & # 34 ; cork & # 34 ; surface and color are very unattractive and cheap looking .	-1
I read the reviews and they were excellent . However , this tape will not tear on my tape dispenser . All others do . I like the clearness but still find them unusable . Find another product .	-1
I purchased this Hammermill glossy flyer paper for the convenience of Amazon , the Hammermill name , and other reviews . However , On my Canon inkjet printer , the color comes out quite dull and not true to what 's on your screen . I had used Staples glossy brochure and flyer paper in the past with good results , so I decided to go ahead and purchase some more at Staples -- the difference is amazing . The Staples paper is true to color and bright . The exact same picture with the exact same settings on the Hammermill -- not true to color and not bright.Perhaps it is just not the right paper for a Canon injet ( ip6600 ) . All I know is , I wo n't be purchasing this brand again.As far as purchasing from Amazon , it came in 2 days with Amazon Prime , as always .	-1
This looked so cheap that I sent it back as soon as possible . It looked like loose plastic on the outside and the inside was nothing special . Ugh ! !	-1
Looks great with the storage zipper pocket and all but fell apart after very minimal use . I 'd steer clear of this brand , based on this experience .	-1
I am a big fan of Cambridge notebooks but this pad-folio is less than functional . For starters , the outer material looks cheap . It has the wavy appearance that comes with faux-leather that has n't been pulled tight before sewing the seams . Furthermore , the zipper pocket feels like it will rip if I do n't handle the zipper pull with surgeon like precision . The sticky note slot is a neat idea in theory but ends at that - it only has enough space available for about 15 sticky notes so do n't dream of loading a whole sticky notepad in there . I was n't really surprised either when my standard sized business cards did n't fit in the business card slots . Do n't waste your money .	-1
which is what I wanted it for . Hopefully it will work for something else some day , but this is a lot to pay for something I have little use for other than that specific task .	-1
Creating the transfer is easy -- the instructions are simple to follow and they work . However , after the first wash ( delicate cycle in a front-loader , cold water , hang to dry ) , the ink starts washing off and the edges start to become frayed . Also , the image itself starts to become crinkled ! Maybe hand washing is what 's needed but that 's not something the instructions call for . In fact , it says you can machine wash & dry -- clearly , you ca n't .	-1
It should not be this hard to peel.It does not peel.It should be easy.I threw the bag of sheete in the trash . Waste of money .	-1
I have tried TWO HP laserjet compatible toner cartridges for my HP Laserjet 1018 and both were substandard and had to be returned for a refund to different companies . One froze my printer as soon as I put it in . The other printed unevenly . I now will only purchase ORIGINAL HP toner cartridges for my machine .	-1
title says it all . Do n't know if I 'm going to get 1,000 or 1,500 or even 2,000 pages from this toner replacement but the way I see it , $ 10 is more than worth it for any of those quantities . I have an HP LaserJet 1012 - no color , duplex or multiple uses other than straight B & W ; printing . HP ( thru Staples or their own website ) wants $ 80 PLUS tax . It 's a simple laserjet for simple printing - if this is what you have , you ca n't go wrong with this product IMHO . **UPDATE** less than 1 month and 50 pages later , streaks and blank areas on every sheet . Yes , I 'm shaking it . PLUS , the original seller is no more as they changed names presumably secondary to all the bad press . I have to go with an OEM product here to get my money 's worth , I guess . Too bad - I reviewed this too soon .	-1
In spite of this reliable printer 's great reputation , it creates steam during the printing process . This is a real deal-killer . No matter how consistent its performance , there is no way I can recommend a printer that steams as it sucks moisture of out printer paper . It turns out this is a common complaint from owners of the LaserJet 1012 . Be warned .	-1
I bought a HP desktop seven years ago . The day after the warranty expired , I called in a problem that had been chronic . HP refused to honor its warranty and instead sent me to India , where people were in training . Ultimately , they convinced me to reformat the disk even though I was convinced it was a hardware problem . They did n't advise me to buy a new disk , which I should have done.I had been using the hp backup utility . It seems to be an overlay on microsoft , but when I tried to restore the files , it failed . The process to get back what I could was arduous.I complained about this up to the top of their pecking order , who told me to get lost . I resolved to never ever buy anything from them again.A couple of weeks ago , my hp1020 printer paper catch broke . I had bought this printer before the computer failed , and it has worked well for more than four years . I went online to see how to replace the cheap chinese plastic paper receiver . HP customer service sent me in circles . Ultimately , they do n't support their product .	-1
I previously gave this printer 5 stars . However , beware . If you print , say , 50 pages in a row , the printer slows from its rated throughput to only ca . 4 pages per minute . HP tech support confirms this , and indicates that a cheap printer 'without a fan ' overheats , and compensates by stopping the continuous printing ... it could not be expected to do any better . Then why is it rated at 15 ppm ? What nonsense . The printer is misrepresented . If you only print a couple of pages at a time , then this is fine . But if you print out program code or book or article manuscripts , this is a BIG problem .	-1
I have had this printer for about 15 months now , and I print only on Canon paper . The colors are always either too yellow or too magenta ( even b & w ; images have a color cast ! ) , and Canon 's own reps could not figure out why or help resolve the problem . I printed on regular computer paper , and the colors were fine . It also does n't print with the densities shown on my original files . My images look exactly right on my computer and print beautifully when I send them to a lab , and I 'm an advanced amateur photographer . In other words , I know well enough what I 'm doing , so it 's not operator error but a printer problem ( which Canon agrees on ) . My mother , who is an artist , had recommended this printer to me , but she began to see a color cast as well and replaced it with an HP printer that 's dead on.When I originally bought this printer , everyone 's reviews said to only use Canon paper to get the best quality , but I 'd have to disagree . I 'm not sure whether to waste money on buying a different brand of paper and trying that , or just buy a different printer , but this one gets a thumbs down from me . What a waste of $ 200 .	-1
I 'll be fair . This printer printed out some of the best photos of my life -- pictures when I first was dating my boyfriend , family photos , when my boyfriend proposed to me , our first big trip together , and yes , even my cute little doggie . But the honeymoon is over . The printer broke down after a year and a half of use . The cause ? You got me . I would 've thought it would have lasted at least 2 years -- but nope . Even my old HP is still running . The upside ... I upgraded to the IP6000D . : )	-1
I really liked this printer while it worked , and the document feeder was really handy . I would never use anything but a flatbed scanner because it is so versatile . I bought the HP back in April 2004 , and I was shocked to see that I replaced with with a Canon PIXMA iP3000 in October 2004 . I still have the Canon and it is still working ! The HP just stopped printing and for the price vs. the cost of fixing it , it made no sense to fix it at the time . I 'll stick to Canon .	-1
This printer was fine until I changed cartridges and a contact was dirty . Now it wo n't quit printing alignment pages all the time . I have about a million now , and its cost me a fortune in ink . Every 3 or 4 print jobs and I get another one.I 've spent hours with technical support , who keep leading me through the same old song and dance , disconnect the usb cable , hit some buttons , print another page I do n't need , and scan . Voila it works ! Case finished.NO IT IS NOT.The tech support people do n't speak English and it shows in their grammar and inability to understand that my problem seems to be a variant on what they have in their knowlege base.HP would do better to hire native English speakers . I 'll never buy another HP printer.Oh , they print fine , that is , if you want a million alignment pages .	-1

Not fair to the ink that I hated this printer so much , but this expensive set of cartridges dried up just as fast as the cheaper no-names ... go figure . I finally wised up and bought another brand of printer .	-1
We picked up this `` HP Everyday Photo Paper '' to print product pictures for my wife 's small business on better quality paper than `` plain paper '' . The end results are better than plain paper , but far below most other lower cost photo paper . Here are my observations : Pros -+ Inexpensive ; for photo paper , this is relatively low pricedCons -- Slow Drying ; myBrother MFC-6490CW Professional Series Color Inkjet Wireless All-in-One Printerhas fairly quick drying ink on most papers , but was really surprised that my prints smudged even after sitting for more than five minutes- Marginal Image Quality ; no amount of tweaking I could do produced `` outstanding '' resultsWe will use the rest of this paper , but will not buy it again.CFH	-1
It 's so slippery , my laser mouse did n't work at all . There 's little tactile feedback , it just feels like you 're gliding across fake marble or something . Very very uncomfortable . Ended up throwing it away , basically .	-1
The ink cartridge is O.K . but the Epson R1800 printer is a huge ink hog . The Epson printer 's that use this cartridge should all be recalled .	-1
I realized that if you just wiggle the tape , and peel off the plastic , then insert whatever you have , then cover back the plastic , then press hard , its just the same as pulling it thru the 'machine ' .	-1
For $ 30 this is a waste of money . What I like is the concept . The legs fit into the desk and you slide the cover over the desk and everything fits for travel perfectly . However , the quality of the material is poor as well as the way it all fits together . Every time I 've used the table it wobbles . It wo n't hold a computer or project securely . I would not put anything over the weight of 2lbs on this thing . After it fell over with the projector on it I had to use two boxed on a chair to prop the projector up . Concept good , but look for something better if you are considering this . You wo n't be happy .	-1
This calculator has pretty much everything in the world you would need from a calculator but why oh why did they leave out a fraction and mixed number buttons ? ? The process to enter fractions is frustrating when you have to do it over and over and even the most basic calculators have these buttons . Even the simpler TI-34 has these buttons . It 's an omission of such a basic feature like this that looses stars from me . Otherwise it is a great device I just have no idea why something so basic and common is n't one of the buttons . If I was n't required to own it I would return it for a device with the same features but with the fraction buttons .	-1
I was excited to receive this phone , charge up the batteries , and try it out . Unfortunately , after plugging this phone into my line ( Verizon phone service with DSL , DSL filter on the line ) , about 80 % of the time the phone would not get a dial tone . Eventually I determined that somehow the the 8865 was dialing a `` 1 '' all by itself ( an 800 number without a preceding `` 1 '' went through OK , a local number would get error `` do not dial a 1 for this number '' ) . Dialing with the handset or base resulted in the same behavior.Thinking this was a bad unit , I tried a 2nd unit ( same model ) , this one did the same thing . @ $ # ^ % @ $ # ! So there is either a design flaw with this model or there 's a bad batch of 8885 's floating around . Uniden CS was polite but unhelpful , so both phones had to be returned.I gave this unit two stars due to it 's sleek design ( though I think the base unit is a bit *too* small and the tiny buttons could be an issue ) . Perhaps your luck with this model will be better than mine .	-1
I previously reviewed this item and gave it two stars because of some of its great features . However , as I mentioned before , I have a small house ( about 1400 sq . ft. ) and the phone did n't work in much of it . People always complained that I was cutting in and out and they usually thought I was on a cell phone . It was worse than my prior , less powerful phone , which cut out only about half as much.Now , after seven months of moderate use , the phone has died . No sound goes in either direction . It 's beyond the 30-day period during which Amazon will accept a return , and I am still waiting to hear from Uniden to see whether they will replace the phone.I now ca n't say whether the phone 's problems all along were because it was a defective unit , or whether this is just a crummy phone , but I can say for certain that it does n't merit the rave reviews given here , and so far , customer service from Uniden is non-existent . I will update this again if they replace the phone and it works better , but I must say , I have seldom been as unimpressed with an electronic product . Nifty features do n't really matter if the basic functions do n't work . Amazon 's editing process does n't let you change the number of stars on a given review , but I 'd take away the stars and give this product nothing . This one is a loser .	-1
You buy used and you take your chances . The item broke down almost immediately after purchase . The vendor was willing to replace it , but I decided additional shipping charges and another used unit were not worth the risk . I bought a new printer instead .	-1
When you read many reviews , you can easily see that the `` one-star '' ratings are usually by people who do n't read the instructions , or possibly just ca n't understand them . I 've read all of the one-star ratings on this R-200 now and I totally agree with them . No I 'm not a printer expert , but I 've owned a lot of different brands of printers and this is by far the worst , though not the most expensive.My dad had an Epson b & w ; printer in the 90 's and each time I had to use it , I would laugh and laugh at how it took such a long time when you turned it on to get ready to print : grunting , groaning , clicking , whirring ... over and over for literally minutes . I swore I 'd never buy an Epson printer , though some of their other products are useable.But ... silly me ... when it was time to replace my nice HP printer simply because I wanted something that would do a perfect job on `` photographs '' , I fell prey to Epson 's claim to top quality . It really did n't dawn on me that the unit would be virtually the same feed and cleaning mechanism as my father 's old piece of junk . I hated it from the beginning . Photos were NOT photo quality , it took ages and ages to start printing , and it ate ink like a famished muppet monster . If you do n't print regularly , the ink cartridges ( there 's 6 total , each costing big bucks from Epson ) dry up on the outputs , and even though you can shake them and hear the slosh , they do n't work . If you buy non-Epson cartridges you get a warning that you are voiding your warranty when you use them , even though they do work fine , and some last much longer than Epson's.But now after 3 years I 've had enough of this expensive POC so I 'll have to gamble on some other brand ... it will definitely never , never , never be another Epson , I do n't care if President Obama puts his picture on the front of it , and God blesses it himself , I will not buy it.One point I can make to those of you stuck with this piece of junk : If you leave it turned on 24/7 it does n't go through all of the initial bracketybrack setup routine . But it still dries up and wo n't work , even if you 're just printing black , if you have run out of cyan or yellow , it WILL NOT WORK until you buy more cartridges to allow to dry out . It 's a total scam and believe me , you will be sorry ... maybe your initial impression will be good , but just wait ... you 'll see.UPDATE 9/30/12 : OK so I dawdled around and did n't order the new printer until today . I am doing a government application for immigration visa for my wife , and that requires mounds of printing and copying . Today I needed to print out my bank statement for the last year , and when I went to the bank site , it said they are changing the system on the 3rd and I 'll only have the past ONE month available ... so of course I want to print this immediately . My printer had been moved a few days ago and it 's been turned off during that time , so I reluctantly started fiddling with it to make it come on properly . About 20 or 25 times I turned it on and off and all I get are blinking lights . I did every trick I 've ever done before , unplugging and sloshing the cartridges , going to the cartridge cleaning and nozzle check software ... nothing at all worked . So I go back and read all of these ONE STAR reviews again , and of course they 're all having the same problems . I choke back the urge to drop an atomic bomb on the Epson Headquarters and I look for the best printer ( non-Epson ) that I can afford , and order a Hewlett Packard OJPRO8100 Wireless Color Printer which has an abundance of good reviews and only a few 3-star reviews , no negatives ... $ 110 compared to over $ 200 for the Epson ( not counting the $ 200 or so I 've spent on ink cartridges to replace cartridges that still contained ink ) . Then I read one more review on the Epson 200 , which said something about unplugging the power cord to reset the interlocks . Well that should n't work , because that 's what always causes the problems ... but I tried it and bingo , suddenly the printer works as good as it ever did ( marginal and slow ) . At least I managed to print my bank statement . Wish I could bill Epson for all of the hours and hours I 've spent trying to make this stupid piece of junk work !	-1
I bought this for the DVD disc printing using a Mac G4 laptop . Ready to put cool disc art on my amazing lttle films . But hu uh . NO LUCK . SPENT HOURS FRETTING OVER EVERY STEP , BUT NOTHING . TRAY JUST VIBRATES IN THE SLOT . BACKS IN AND OUT WITH MY BLANK DISC . THEN RED LIGHTS ON THE PRINTER FLASH IN MOCKERY . Hate this Epson non DVD print disabled fraud . Love the Mac , though . This is a new , out of the box model . And there 's no help for the problem . Under menu HELP it actually says `` No help available . '' Boy , that chutzpah.I 'm not new to printers or settting up software.Beware buyer . Do n't be a sucker .	-1
I 've given this phone more than a fair trial . I 've purchased this and 5825 phones three times . ( The 5825 has no answering device but identical handsets . ) All of their identical handsets have malfunctioned immediately or eventually . The first time one of the screens lost contrast and became unreadable . The last two times the handset became inoperable after being left off of the cradle for several hours . None of the buttons would respond until the phone was recradled for a moment . ( This would happen even after the batteries were fully charged . ) I returned the first two for refunds , but the third time I sent a message to VTech 's online `` support . '' Their email response was : `` Due to the nature of your inquiry , your request would have to be handled by a representative who will provide you with the more detailed information . '' But when I called the `` tech support '' number provided I infuriatingly discovered that they only have automated tech support when you select the support phone menu option . So , I called the sales number and the rep said they are trying out this new automated approach to `` tech support . '' That is , they have decided to ditch genuine support.I asked to speak to a sales supervisor and he said that they have had other complaints about the inoperable handsets . He offered to send me replacement handsets , saying that he thought they have fixed the issue . Which brings up the obvious question : why are they still permitting retailers to sell units that VTech knows have defects ? I 've only had this one for a week . Should n't those defective phones be recalled ? The supervisor 's only response was to chuckle nervously.So , while these phones have good talk time and audio quality , and respectable features , I ca n't recommend them since they are highly prone to defects and the company has such a laughable excuse for support .	-1
Using these labels has been nothing but trouble , producing shoddy results and labels that peel away from the CD/DVD . As for the formatting and printing process , it was even worse . We tried downloading their software for Mac online and followed all the directions . It was fairly straightforward , so we finished everything and went to print it . What happened next ? THEY WANTED MONEY . IT WOULD NOT PRINT WITHOUT A WATERMARK UNLESS YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE . After ALREADY BUYING their product , there was a HIDDEN COST . We wasted time putting everything together only to find we would have to come up with a work-around . That work-around took a tremendous amount of time , and again , had mediocre results because of formatting issues as well as the matte finish ( the paper feels kind of rough and cheap , worse than some basic printing papers ) . The initial price of these labels is a trick . They seem cheap , but they have hidden costs and the labels themselves do n't even stick , sometimes nearly ruining people 's drives . BAD , BAD , BAD .	-1
This review is being written after two years of use in a busy restaurant and bar , so I 've really put this system to the test . Though it has admirable voice quality , this system has so many quirks that it just should n't be considered as a primary business phone system . First and foremost , when you are on one of the lines speaking to a customer , and a call rings on the other line , the line you are speaking on gets constantly interrupted with momentary silencing of your voice so that the person on the other end of the line hears your voice dropping out every few seconds while the other line is ringing ! ! ! This is an absolutely unforgivable flaw ! Uniden tech support told me that there is no way to disable this quirk either . You just have to live with it . For shame ! Also , once every few days , the phone system decides to reset itself without warning . So , the phone rings , you answer and it disconnects the person calling while you are greeted with the `` Welcome '' screen as the system resets itself . After about a minute or so , you 're able to receive calls again . As an added bonus , it occasionally screeches super loud feedback into your ear instead of connecting you to the call you are answering . Seriously , it hurts your eardrums something awful.The signal is VERY fussy too . It does n't like working when near metal objects like restaurant refrigerators and other large appliances , nor does it work very well if any masonry walls are between you and the base.Terrible phone system . I have a one line and two line phone system from Uniden and would n't recommend it to anyone . Stay clear of this poorly designed , clearly inferior product .	-1
... Give me a break ! Just out of curiousity , I bought a 5.8 GHz cordless at a local store and compared it to my trusty , twenty-dollar 900MHz Uniden.Guess what ? The two phones sounded PRETTY MUCH THE SAME , in fact the 900MHz one was actually a little clearer in some parts of the house.I will say though , the 5.8GHz phone does sound better than the disastrous 2.4GHz Uniden I bought and returned last year . But this one 's going back too ... why pay more for what is basically the same performance ? Again : DO N'T BELIEVE THE ADVERTISING B.S . ! ! ! ! I 'm giving this phone 1 star not for its actual performance , but for the absolutely shameless advertising HYPE around it . ( This is kind of like a 3.0GHz PC compared to a 1.2GHz PC : with 90 % of commonly used applications , their performance is virtually identical ... only you 'll pay a lot more for the bigger number GHz . )	-1
Epson claims photos printed from PictureMates are waterproof . This oft repeated claim is blatantly false . I 'm disappointed that professional reviewers have n't exposed this farce . Newly printed photos seem to have some waterproofing but that quickly disappears . Test it yourself . Simply place a drop of water on a months old photo , wait a few seconds , gently mat the paper . The result is a ruined photo . How is that waterproof ? I bought this printer because of the great quality ( true ) and waterproof photo feature . I 'm really disappointed with the waterproof claim . They 've duped us all.Kudos to the other photo printer manufacturers for not following suit with equally false claims . It must have been tempting to do so .	-1
Love the look of it , price was great but if you do a lot of taping as I do , the base is not weighted enough to truly be & # 34 ; one handed & # 34 ; with ease . If you are just looking for a desk accessory or only use tape now and then-price and looks ca n't be beat .	-1
I ordered this pen and the first one had a super scratchy nib - it can happen and it is a Fine nib , but it sounded like I was ripping phone-books while writing . So , the exchange came promptly from Amazon - this new one is n't scratchy , but it writes very ... choppy is the best way to put it . It does n't skip exactly , but line width 's vary wildly even when writing at a consistent speed.So , the second pen had a nib that looked uneven ( not the tines ) . The sides had different angles when it bent in to make the nib point . This was clearly visible to the naked eye so I imagine this did n't help . The main issue seemed to be the 'required ' way to hold this pen - it 's a good angle , but sometimes you need to hold something slightly different . The second pen I got , the nib would have worked if I could tilt the pen more , but then my finger was holding the edge and not on the 'guides ' . I saw no easy way through internet searching to pull the feed out ( the nib comes off easy , but that wo n't change the angle ) . For a $ 20 pen , this was n't worth the hassle . It is n't like this is some nice desk pen people 'ohhh ' and 'awe ' at . It 's a fucntional pen that needed to work right the first time and every time - it didn't.I did give it a second star for the fact it started writing instantly , every try . Even my more expensive pens occassionaly require a few strokes to get the pen fully up to speed . This lamy wrote the second I put the inked converter in and never stopped . So , if you get one with a good nib/feed - it should be great . I ca n't just keep sending it back and playing the lottery .	-1
This is probably a fine label machine for most computrs , but it would n't work with my new Vista operating system.Brother 's customer service representative put forth great effort to do what was needed to make the driver function . After three phone sessions with Brother , the driver did work ; sort of . Yes the label printer worked , but then my printer/copier wouldn't.I suppose that I fiddled with it for over an hour by myself , and then almost that long in company with a Brother Tech Support person . I must say that the Brother telephone support people were really great . They seemed to know what they were talking agout . They were patient and really tried to get the thing working properly.After I found that what had been done for the Brother machine messed up the operation of my Canon printer/copier I decided enough was enough , and the label printer is now landfill somewhere .	-1
This item is being heavily discounted at some online retailers , but make sure you read the fine print before buying : Make sure you can return it for a refund , not just an exchange.It 's a fine scanner when it operates -- just read the reviews . But I suspect many people are returning it because , on some systems , software and driver conflicts are causing problems.I tried running it from a Toshiba A10 Satellite laptop with Windows XP and Adobe Photoshop 6.01 . It scanned beautifully -- once . After that , the system refused to see the scanner when it was connected . I spent several hours on the phone with Canon customer support trying to resolve it . The rep was very helpful and patient , but ultimately the problem could not be resolved.I went even further , did a several clean system installs on my computer and loaded apps one by one , testing the scanner each time . The same thing happened each time -- one good operation of the scanner , and then the system ignored it.I 'm disappointed that what promised to be a very good scanner wo n't operate due to the mysteries of compatibility . But I 'm more disappointed that I can only return it for an exchange . I do n't need a duplicate of the problems.I also do n't need a $ 130 boat anchor , which is about all the scanner is right now . I 'll probably stick it in a closet and try it with a new system one day , if and when I get one.Again , it seems to be a great scanner if it will run on your system . But before you buy make sure you can return it for a refund . That way if it does n't work for you you wo n't get burned.EDITED TO ADD : Many months after I first purchased this scanner and wrote this review I downloaded newly updated driver software from the manufacturer . That apparently finally resolved the issues . The scanner has been working fine ever since .	-1
I run a small business and had finally worn out my HP G85 OfficeJet and was looking for a replacement all-in-one for my home office . This was not it.This is my second go around with this specific printer . I returned the first one because I thought I had a lemon . I was mistaken , they are just that bad.Printer consistently jams if you try to print multiple documents . You ca n't see the jam because there is not one . You just press 'OK ' like you had actually cleared something and it will start printing again.It will not receive incoming faxes from certain types of fax machines . And yes , that was verified by HP support.It will not work on any type of VOIP service . This was also verified by HP support.And on & on ... ..I cringed every time I selected 'File -- - > Print . If the printer were to have burst into flames and melted down to the very core of the planet I would not have been the least suprised.Anyhow , I have thrown it in the trash . About 200 bucks down the tubes but it was more than worth it to avoid the daily frustration of dealing with this printer .	-1
I have always been an HP fan and have owned 7 HP printers over the years , including 3 Laserjets . Until this one , I would have highly recommended HP but it appears HP has abandoned their loyal customers and is now producing garbage . I have had this all-in-one for 9 mo . and have yet to get it to scan more than once . After countless hours installing , re-installing on 2 different PCs , using HPs support website , tech support and even their senior tech support who sent me a new printer , it wo n't work . My last call involved 3+ hours on the phone dissecting my registry after which I was told I had operating system problems . From day one , the software locked up when I tried to scan . HP insists it will work on a clean install . So yesterday , I started with a new hard drive , installed Windows XP but nothing else and then the printer driver . It works -- once ! Then I installed Office XP and after that it locks up the first time I try to scan . I will never , ever buy another HP product ! ! ! After reading the reviews here and elsewhere , it is certain that this software is crap , as is the 6210 . Half the people who write reviews have had problems with this overpriced paperweight . Stay FAR , FAR away ! ! ! HP are you reading this ? ? ? Check case ID 6300331720 . That 's only one of 3 case IDs I have . If I billed you for all my time trying to make this 6210 work , I could buy a color laser printer !	-1
At first , I was VERY pleased with this printer . After a few months , I kept getting a `` carriage jam '' error . I have no jams , buj to reset the printer takes some cumbersome effort . I got online , and learned that this is a COMMON and known problem with this printer . Shop around -- the printer is great , except these `` carriage jams '' appear out of nowhere and for no reason -- a glitch -- and it takes up to five minutes to reset the printer to work again . Good printer , until it jams ... .UPDATE : The scanner does not work with VISTA . Known issue per HP .	-1
I have the OfficeJet 6110 All-in-One for just over a year . It worked well for several months and I was very pleased with the purchase . But when I bought a new HP desktop ( my old one was also an HP desktop ) , problems started happening . It took me days and millions of phone calls , the problem still persists . Here 's what I figured out in the process about HP products:1 . HP 's own printers and computers do n't work together . Duplicate software get installed and conflict with each other.2 . HP 's printer support staff do NOT talk to the computer support staff . When software conflicts start -- all HP software , one has to figure out on one 's own where the problems are before calling them . Otherwise , while various technical support staff try to diagnose the problem , more problems will happen as various drivers get deleted and re-installed.3 . Once an HP 's software ( my experience is mostly with HP printers ) is installed , one can NOT get rid of it by uninstalling it . HP provides a `` software cleanup utility '' , which must be run several times ( with re-start in between ) before actual de-install completes ( if then ) . Often times , one has to manually get into various directories to delete folders . If one 's desktop happens to be an HP as well , then good luck figuring out whether a particular HP folder should be deleted or kept . Sometimes one has to make changes in the registry in order to totally get rid of HP software . Hard to believe , but it 's true.4 . If you run into problems with this printer , do n't call for support . And absolutely do not use their chat line ( staffed by entry level technicians ) . Now and then I get a good HP support staff , but mostly they are reading over some generic manual on their end and give you adivce that is , at best , useless .	-1
I write with my left hand , but straight on the page like a right-hander , not `` over-hand . '' Most fountain pens work fine for me . However , this one is a real problem , because the nib is set in a straight line with the clip . I ca n't grip the pen properly and it 's awkward and immediately tiring to my hand . I 'm really sad about this , because I just love the idea of it , and other Pilot pens are terrific.As a leftie , I knew I was taking a chance with the pen . I 'm going to mark this with 2-stars to get attention for left-handers , but please do not take that to mean the product is less than extraordinary and best-in-class . It is . Mine is blue with gold accents and it is beautiful . The nib retraction is amazing.I will offer this pen to a couple of artistic family members who I 'm sure will give it a good and loving home . : )	-1
Wish I could return these-they run just like the others into surrounding colors . Used on muslin fabric project , will try on a firmer type of fabric	-1
first off , this is not what i paid for . I paid $ 10 to get a package of markers that only half of them work , and the colors are different than shown in pic . Though they might be & # 34 ; new in package & # 34 ; they are OLD and DRIED UP . 5 of the 12 dont even work , the rest are okayish but did not get colors shown . most are neon colored and hard to see anyway . SAVE YOUR MONEY , I WOULD SHOP SOMEWHERE ELSE & # 62 ;	-1
