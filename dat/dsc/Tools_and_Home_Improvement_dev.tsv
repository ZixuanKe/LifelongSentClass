this saw is hard to get used to . it has a spring loaded guard that you need to hold a trigger to release it , while using the saw you need to push down all the way , and forward . this combination is actually more dangerous than having the guard there in the first place . because you have to focus pushing downward , it 's easy to slip out of the cut , i 'm temped to pull out one of those wheels and replace it with a thumb screw.its also uncomfortable to hold , the device flares out and digs into your hand , something else i have to modify.and the laser is battery operated , leave it on and it dies . the laser is also far too bright , i ca n't see the pencil line and for the most part is a useless feature since it really only works well for long things , and if i were cutting something long , i would use a real saw . the saw is strong enough to push through 3/4 & # 34 ; plywood and the small size makes it easy for an afternoon job , or a plunge cut . all the dust shoots out the bottom of the cut . because you can only use one hand to use it , there is still a chance you 'll cut a thumb off if your holding the board in place.i love the bag , i wish all tools came in bags . it 's about the size of a shoe box , and you can put other tools in there . right now i have that and a rotozip , seems like a good combo . i wish the bag has straps for a shoulder though , it does n't even have rings for one . but it 's sort of a bonus so i should n't complain.it was between this one and the dremel max thing , i did n't get dremel due to the terrible blade design they had , grinding wood will just start fires . this saw actually has a blade.oh and while small , and seemingly perfect for cutting things like lattice or thin stock . you still need to put it on a table , because of that darn guard , pushing it down and forward is too hard . so the dremel would win cutting that kind of stock .	1
Works as advertised except that laser switch will not stay on . Especially useful and fast for cross cutting using a speed square . Takes a few minutes to adjust to holding switch while pressing blade down . Rockwell should sell individual blade types separately instead of in combination .	1
The Good : Easily adjustable.Cuts like a dream through intended materials.Has shown itself to be durable and well made.The Bad : The laser on mine is basically useless ( unless cutting in the dark , maybe ) , and does n't seem to be aligned properly.Bottom Line : Recommended , for specific materials and tasks , finishing work .	1
Received the Rockwell RK3440K VersaCut Circular Saw as a Christmas gift last year . Really had no idea how I 'd use the tool since I have a circular saw already . Let me tell you , my standard circular saw collects dust now . The VersaCut is so easy compact and easy to use . The laser and edge guide provide nice straight cuts . The depth control and retractable blade keeps it safe . I 'm able to make cuts at all angles and positions . This is one of the best , most used tools in my house ! My only tips are:1 . Make sure your work surface is stable . Exposing the blade takes a fairly significant amount of pressure.2 . Do n't forget to turn off the laser !	1
The quality of this product is amazing , it was a gift for my Father . he loves it , his only complaint is the spring retention on the metal plate is VERY stiff and he wishes he could adjust it .	1
Cut some pressure treated 4x4 's , did n't even slow the versa cut down . I 've not tried it on metal or brick ... .maybe never will , it just nice to use for small jobs rather bringing out a full size circular saw or table saw . I use to use a jig saw for small cuts ... .this leaves a better cut ... .if it a straight line your needing .	1
Age and health was severely cramping my ability to weild my regular circular saw , and this was the perfect saw for weight , ease , and for the type of cuts I was now making .	1
This is a nice saw . Easy to use and is a great asset to my tools . Great for jobs in tight corners	1
I am a professional contractor and had no idea that I needed one of these until I tried one . I can cut tile , grout , drywall , plywood , siding , shingles , hardie-backer , etc.- all while using a vacuum attachment that actually works ! This is a very important aspect of a renovator 's livelihood if you are in a different customer 's house everyday . This tool cuts clean with a deapth adjustment and keeps the home clean for the homeowner ( and me ) . The compact size lets me get into smaller areas . Best of all , I do n't need to drag out the worm drive for cuts under an inch thick anymore ! The laser button needs to be thought-out better ( location ) but , it has no effect on the performance.Best thing since my Fien Multi-tool .	1
I love the size of the Saw and the way it can cut along a line without messing up like a heavy saw has a tendency to be hard to follow a cut line.Timothy the tool man	1
This is my first Rockwell tool . My first impression is that it was made well and was a good quality tool . We put it right to work on several flood restoration projects cutting out waterlogged drywall . Setting the blade for the desired depth of cut was fast and easy . The plunge cut blade hits the the set depth and you cut away . With a vacuum hooked up there was virtually no dust from the drywall . The laser line seems to work fine but we snapped chalk lines and followed them as you normally would with any circular saw . Although we purchased this saw specifically for cutting out drywall , I 'm confident it would work well in other limited cutting applications .	1
While I think Rockwell has an excellent idea going , I think they missed the boat on ergonomics . For one , this machine is not well balanced , and consequently creates fatigue . The safety features that are there to prevent the blade from being exposed requires that one lever first be pressed and released , before the power button can be turned on , and at the same time one needs to keep pressure on the saw to keep it plunged . My wrist started to hurt within 5 minutes of using the saw , and I find it a major annoyance for an otherwise well designed machine . As the blades start to dull , further pressure is required to keep the saw in contact with the work . I resorted to wedging a small piece of wood in the sliding mechanism to keep the saw plunged , although I certainly do n't advocate that anybody else do this . I use an acrylic base and a guide , so I 'm not overly concerned if the saw kicks back . The very small diameter blade tends to prevent kickbacks , but it is possible.My other complaint about this saw is that the blade is on the left-hand side of the base , as opposed to the right . Again , for right-handed people this is out of balance . If you need to trim say a half or three quarters of an inch off a board , most of the weight of the machine is not supported . The old worm drive skill saws were like this and I always hated that design . If you 're left-handed , you will probably love it ; ) The plus side is it 's easier to guide/see the blade . Most people will probably find this feature a plus , but I do n't like it.The saw seems to have plenty of power for maximum depth of cut , although I have not tried going through any hardwood as of yet , just plywood . I did have some issues with chipping on plywood with the supplied 24 tooth blade . The 40 tooth metal Blade gives cleaner crosscuts , but dulls quite quickly . I would like to see a 32 or 40 tooth wood blade become available . This is the only saw I can think of that has one , and only one option for a carbide tipped blade . What woodworker only uses one blade ? Give us some options Rockwell ! The ability to use a vacuum is absolutely wonderful , and the saw feels very safe on small pieces of lumber . There are many times I have wished for a small saw like this , so many of its features are welcome . I just wish they designed it like a more traditional circular saw . Makita , Dewalt and others have more traditional designs in their plunge saws .	1
Great little saw for those small jobs . The locking nut was on so tight that I needed a socket wrench and extra muscle to loosen it . I took advantage of an Amazon Warehouse Deal to get it cheaper than Retail . The laser alignment is the first one I 've seen that is accurate to where the blade runs ( and not offset ) . And the laser is quite strong , too .	1
Superb light output and these can be dimmed extremely well down to near zero without flickering on an X10 style remote light control system . I think the warm white works better in living room and entertainment room areas with earth tone colors than the blue-ish light output from the pure white 5100K color temperature bulbs .	1
I placed these LED lights ( warm white ) in the ceiling of an entryway to the garage . I was always turning these lights OFF for others when the area was not in use . When I turned ON the new LED lights , I thought my wife would be unhappy with the appearance ; however , I surprisingly heard her say , `` Oh , I like these ! '' So , now using only 10 % of the electricity to produce nearly as much light , I do not mind the family leaving the lights ON in this entry area . Also , the old , original dimmer works just fine , so there is no need to pay double for a special dimmer . The original dimmer dims the LED lights from full-bright down to about one-third-bright , which is just fine . The only getting use to is the one-second delay when turning these LED lights ON .	1
I bought a bunch of these for my home . I put them in to recessed canned lighting on the ceiling . The light output is nice in quantity and quality of the cool white . I have tried 2 other brands of the same type of lamp , maxximastyle and ecosmart . These LEDwholesalers are better than those in both quality and price . Cheers .	1
Work very well on our porch . Dimmable and provide much more light than I expected . LEDs are pricey , but we bought six for the porch and they light it very well .	1
I bought these to replace the outdoor floodlight I currently have . Fist , I happen to prefer the cooler while light over the warm ( or more yellow ) light that a halogen or incandescent will give . This is a matter of taste and if you do n't like the cool light , do not get these , you wo n't like it . However if you can live with it , they flood very nicely and light a wide area . I use these in light with motion sensor lights and they light up fast . Now for the money saving part . My house and yard are ringed with these lights and when I take my dogs outside to work them , they can turn them all on in no time . That 's over 1100 watts of conventional halogen lighting . With these and other lighting systems , I am down to under 200 watts . I 'm saving close to $ 50 , thanks to my conversion . I figure after about 10 months , they will have paid for themselves and the savings is free and clear .	1
As other reviewers here mentioned , these LED bulbs are super bright ... daylight bright . Turns night into day ! I use these on my motion-sensor system . They exhibit no visible borders ( the circular pattern you 'd see with spotlights ) like the previous halogen bulbs I 've used . The spread patterns are wide . Just be aware you 're that these are daylight bulbs and you should not be disappointed . Lowes carry several brands ( Sylvania 's ? ) of these LED style but cost 10-15 dollars more .	1
Two flood lights at my stairs are rather difficult to access . I decided to put LED lights there so that I do n't need to replace them that often.I 'm very happy with this LED light . It is very bright . It looks like it is very well constructed . It is much heavier than a regular or CFL light bulb , but I do n't have any problem with that .	1
This lamp will last you a very long time and it 's brighter than any other lamp I have ever seen before . It will also save you plenty of money in your light bill .	1
I tested these bulbs against the Phillips 15Watt , G7 18Watt ( 1200 Lumens ) , and Fiet 18 Watt ( 1000 lumens ) . For area coverage brightness these were the best . It was made to RoHS specs . It 's 2 watts more , but the price was also the best bang per buck . The G7 was a warmer yellow spot light , the Fiet was on par with the phillips but still a spot light . The only bad thing about this light is that it 's not suitable for outdoors as indicated on the box , the G7 , Phillips , and Fiet were .	1
We purchased this bulb to test it in a recessed can on an enclosed porch . CFLs do not like cold temperatures , do n't dim well , and of course the traditional incandescent bulbs are going the way of the dodos . So maybe LEDs will provide the proverbial light at the end of this tunnel our congress critters made for us.My `` cans '' are made for par30s , and I needed a `` socket extender '' to make this par38 fit , but the light it produces is MUCH more than the par30 LED I tested . Hence it is worth futzing with the socket extender- I am very impressed with the amount of light . The light is much brighter and whiter than the 45 watt incandescent par30 it is replacing . To my eye it is about the color of sunlight , not as yellow as most lighting . The dimming works well , without the change in light color which happens with incandescent bulbs . At minimum on the dimmer the LED light is still producing some light , while the incandescent is completely dark . I do n't mind this , but YMMV.This bulb has a fairly wide angle of illumination , good for recessed lighting and probably good for a floodlight as well . Not sure if it can handle weather though.The only downside is the cost and the relatively untried technology . I expect the cost to continue to drop , and these `` may '' be cost-effective , even at $ 50 a bulb . I have not found the CFLs to live up to the hype in terms of life span , perhaps the LEDs may do better . The estimates raise the philosophical question of why I would want to buy a light bulb that will last longer than my house . They are certainly efficient , but at the rate I am using this bulb ( 2 or 3 hours , maybe 3 nights a week ) , it will take me about 100 years to report on the accuracy of the 20,000 to 50,000 hour life expectancy . Stay tuned ! The bottom line is that we like this light a lot .	1
I previously purchased , and reviewed , the similar LED floodlight with a more industrial lighting color . When my spouse complained they looked too much like an office or a shopping mall , I decided to try these in hopes I could still get efficient lighting in the PAR38 form-factor . Well , great choice . I replaced the other bulbs and the effect is dramatic . I 'm going to be using these two or three at a time ( they are pricey ) to replace all the interior floodlights as the existing bulbs come to end of life , if not before.So far , I find this brand a higher quality than other brands I 've purchased , and reviewed , in the past . They are better made ( more physically sturdy ) , better packaged ( a stronger , better labeled box ) and easier to install ( the threaded portion is cleaner and smoother and screws in without any binding ) .They are n't cheap and they are n't the cheapest , but they are the best VALUE that I 've found so far in the still-not-cheap LED bulbs.Sometimes shipping is labeled as free , as in `` Free shipping when purchased from LEDwholesalers '' , but the charge is up to $ 11.60 to ship , so be cautious about what you are doing here .	1
Installation was pretty easy , but if you do n't know what you are doing in a breaker box , I 'd suggest getting some assistance.The device pretty much just sits there and looks at me with its green glowing eyes . With any luck it is actually doing something ! I really do n't know the science behind it , but figured it was pretty cheap insurance to help protect other electronics in the house from a surge .	1
I 've had more than my share of damage of my electronics due to thunder storms . I bought two of these and installed them according to the instructions and solved all my problems . Good product fair price . I 'm delighted .	1
This thing is simple to install . It replaced a 20-Amp 2 Pole 240-Volt Circuit Breaker . Once I turned the surge protector ` s breakers on , two built-in green lights came on indicating circuit protection . This is an excellent choice over having many surge protector strips all around the house . However , like any other surge protector , one must really hope to never have to find out if it really works ... or not.One drawback is that it does n't protect cable TV as cable or satellite signal is sent through a coaxial cable independent of the electric wiring . For that you may want to install a surge protector like theIntermatic IG1300-2T-1C3 120/240 VAC Single Phase Type 2 Surge Protection with Two Telephone and One Coax Lines , which is also sold here at Amazon .	1
Took about 3 minutes to install , could n't be easier . I do n't know if it works because I have n't been struck by lightning yet , but Siemens is a good name so I will trust it.From all the units I looked at , I chose this one because it pops in the box and that 's it - no exterior holes , mounting , cable routing , gouging , hacking or swearing . This just popped in and that was it.I bought two , one as a spare.Love it .	1
Realistically , this is a niche item for most DIYers . I am building a 5 outlet panel for my closet in my spare room . With all my stuff ... Security DVR , router , modem , ecigarette battery chargers , Li-ion tools battery chargers , Lawn Mower battery chargers my spare room was a den of cordless and corded nightmares . So I planned out what i needed and got everything together but the breakers that i needed to run the dedicated line to the outlets . Low and behold I came across this item recommended by Amazon for me . Considering I have hospital grade surge outlets on every one in my home ( not bought here FYI ) i believe Amazon has spies in my packages : - ) . So the surge lunatic that i am ponied the extra 70 $ ( versus 30 $ for two standard beaker ) and placed my order on Amazon . I can tell you a couple of things about this product , It fit in my electrical panel ( GE ) perfectly ( took up two breaker spots , gave me two working breakers , It was east to install . It also has given me piece of mind . Other than those things , until an event triggers the extra protection , I can say that as a dual breaker it is as good as any other breaker I have installed . A lot of electricians swear by these TYPES of whole house protection , so that is as far as I got with if this was a worthwhile investment .	1
This came quickly and installed fast with the simple included instructions ; provides whole-house surge protection where installed.Warning - NOT for homeowner - requires removal of the main electrical panel cover and if you do n't know what you 're doing , HIRE AN ELECTRICIAN ! !	1
Note : You will need two 20 Amp circuits next to each other for this product ( or relocate them to be next to each other ) . Or you can buy a 15 amp , or other versions of this product . The two circuits must also not be tied . ( Eg : 220v items such as dryers , ac units furnaces etc . ) .The surge protector/breaker was very easy to install with standard electrical tools . Total install time for two of these ( one per 200A panel ) . Was less than 15 minutes . You should install one of these per subpanel.The device protects from phase to ground through the neutral wire , so you should ensure your neutral is suitably sized ( if it were n't you should have fixed this by now anyway - it 's a major code violation ) - should never be a problem really.Anyway good protector - good results so far , no failures . I do wish it had a buzzer to notify of a failed protection though . I just check it every so often.Shut off main power and follow all code and safety regulations before working with this product . If you do n't know how to install it - ask for help , or find an electrician .	1
My house has 4 wires from the furnace/AC to the thermostat , and no spares . You may have read that this thermostat will need external power in this case , or a new line run from the thermostat to power the unit . That is not 100 % correct.I had R , W , Y , and G. I connected my G wire to C ( labelled 24Com ) at the thermostat and moved the G wire to the C terminal at the furnace . Then I put a jumper from the Y to G at the furnace . Doing this removes the ability to manually turn the fan on , but it runs properly when heating or cooling . Honeywell has a video on YouTube that describes the process . You may screw it up , void your warranty , and destroy the device . You have been warned.It works fine for me with 4 wires . I 'm using a VeraLite to control the device , but it works as a standalone unit as well . If I change the temperature at the wall , it has changed in Vera before I can make it to the computer.This thermostat is a great value .	1
Before I started installation I was expecting it to take hours and figured I would have some type of complication . However installation was a complete breeze and took less than 30 minutes total . First of all the instructions were large and I found them very easy to understand and follow . I had my old thermostat removed and my newer and much smarter thermostat installed with no frustration at all . Once installation was complete I was able to link it to my Nexia Bridge in just a few minutes . Once connected to the Nexia Bridge then you can control your thermostat from your iPad , iPhone , iPod touch or Android device . I use my iPad and I really like the app because it 's simple to use and allows you to do so much . All you have to do is register online and download the Nexia Home Intelligence app to your device and login . Then you can view the current temperature inside and outside the house , change to heat or a/c , raise or lower the thermostat , turn the fan on or off or set to auto or energy saving mode . You can create schedules to conserve energy and lower the thermostat while you are asleep or away at work . You can also see a log that will let you see every adjustment that is made to the thermostat . The thermostat also has a built in timer that will flash and remind you when to change your furnace filter . I absolutely love this thermostat except for one thing . You must purchase a subscription in order to use the app for any remotely controlled functions and without those options that it 's pretty much a standard thermostat . You might find the subscription cost a little pricey if you are only using it for this thermostat but it would seem more reasonable if you are using it with other Z-Wave products like electronic door locks , light dimmers , wireless security cameras , motion sensors and window or door sensors . You can create quite an amazing and smart home network but I 'll warn you it can be costly you not only have the purchase price of the equipment but also monthly subscription plan for remote access . Overall I am really impressed my all you can do with this thermostat and would highly recommend it .	1
After reading other reviews , I purchased this to add to my ADT Pulse . It was very easy to add to the Pulse system and is working great . The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I like to use a daily program to run my HVAC , then modify it as necessary during the day ( either warmer or cooler ) . This thermostat has a scheduling function , but it 's turned off by default . And to turn it on you need to access an installer screen . I did this and now I have a schedule set up . But the assumption is that you will control the thermostat from your Z-wave controller , so the scheduling program is off . It took a while to find this info because the instruction sheet that comes with the thermostat is about installing and basic usage . They 're great directions for what they do , but I had to go through the Trane website to find the user manual.My HVAC system already had a 5-wire hookup , so that aided in making the installation easy . I had to hook up the 5th wire to the power supply , but the included instructions advised where to make the connections on the HVAC fan circuit board . It was a breeze . I 'm not sure how it would have gone without the 5th wire , so I checked to make sure I had it before ordering . I would strongly advise doing the same thing .	1
I 've lived in my loft for 8 years now . In addition to the cheap thermostat the builder put in , I 've had a Honeywell and a Hunter thermostat . Each of them would take the temp ( heat or cold ) to 1 degree past the setting - example : Summer setting at 77 , thermostat would turn on at 78 and off at 76 . If I wanted it to turn off at 76 I 'd put it at 76 . I have to say , this baby is accurate . It turns off at the temp I set it at - exactly ! I had a problem initially to get power to the condenser outside and put my old one back on because it was 92 outside and their support was closed . Called them today , great tech gave me the exact steps to take , was n't wiring , was in the setup for my heat pump . It works perfectly now and setup with my micasa was a breeze . Now my entire house is automated and accessible on my android via AutHomationHD app , free , speedy and works great .	1
Got two for my home . Connected to z-wave alarm system . Can now program from phone or computer as well as manually . Much easier to program on computer as it is all graphical . Can also set actions for various sensor conditions . For example the temp set point can be changed based upon arming the alarm system . Very handy . Other features ( learning my preferences ) not yet explored . So far I 'm a happy shopper .	1
This is a new geenration of the Trane / RCS thermostat.Not only the case is different , also the inside board layout has changed.Apart from that it works just identical to the previous model.I used this to replace an older honywell upstairs ( i have a zoned system ) . Now both zones have their own Z-Wave control .	1
After reading some of the reviews from others , this thermostat actually works with the ADT Pulse . The enrollment to the ADT system was painless , once connected it will say unsupported thermostat but still work with no issues . Great replacement for the RCS thermostat and also cost less recommended .	1
Recently started buying DeWalt tools . The best decision I 've made with regard to tools . This drill is light , strong and speed adjustable . It has a three speed transmission - pick speed for the job . There 's a light with 20 second delay . Drilling steel and could not slow it down . Has the 3.0 AH battery that should hold a charge for quite a while . The battery charged in a 30 minutes . I have nothing but good things to say about this drill . I 'm very glad I purchased it.After some time and use goes buy , I will revisit this review with a update.02/20/12Have used drill a number of time since first review . My review needs to add 5 more stars , this drill is great . I know why you see this drill on those home improvement and DIY shows , there 's none better . Drilling concrete and the three speed transmission ca n't be beat . The battery is almost , if not unstoppable . Need a hammer drill buy this one .	1
Item is very good and has done a good job for us . It does not have he belt clip but that is not a problem at this time .	1
I 'm not a professional carpenter , but my brother is and when he tells me there 's no better cordless drill than a DeWALT , I place a lot of value in that kind of endorsement . This is the drill he turns to when he 's not using the industrial corded drills on his work sites and it 's been nothing but durable and reliable for him whether he 's drilling holes or screwing wall frames into concrete.I live in a New York City apartment , so I have limited opportunities to push this drill to the limits . The buildings here are old and some of the walls might as well be made of concrete and metal ( actually , some of them probably are ! ) . I wish I 'd had this a few months ago when I was putting up shades in one of the rooms and had to drill through the metal window frame . My roommate 's & lt ; $ 100 Black & Decker just was n't up to the task and what ended up taking hours probably would have taken minutes with this DeWALT , especially with the hammerdrill option . The drill has two rechargeable batteries , an AC charger , a detachable side handle , and a durable plastic case that holds it all . It 's a bit overkill for my current needs , but will serve me very well for years to come ( and there 's no way I 'll be able to go back to cheaper inferior drills ) .Some people have pointed out that , despite the product description , the batteries are actually 18-volt . Another gripe I 've seen is that the batteries take longer to charge than those of competing drills ( my brother 's only gripe is about the batteries , hence 4/5 stars ) . I have n't tested competing drills of this caliber so I ca n't offer a useful opinion on that .	1
I 've always just borrowed a hammer drill when needed . I 've used the older Dewalt 18v hammer drill enough to know this one is a great update and made me finally break down and buy my own.This thing has so much power and the rpm 's are crazy fast . I do n't know of anything this thing ca n't go through ! On top of that it can still be gentle enough to put a screw into more delicate places.The grip is perfect in my hands and does n't feel too heavy at all . If you have small hands or need less weight I 'd go for the 1.5 battery as it does make it a bit lighter . I do feel it makes it a bit top heavy with the smaller battery but nothing too bad . If you do n't need the hammerdrill function and want a lighter tool you may be better off with the 12v drill honestly . I wanted something that no matter what the job I could pick up one tool and this really does the trick . I was waiting to see if they release a brushless version of this but decided to go ahead and get this because I needed something now and who knows when they will put one out.With this and the brushless impact drill I have a powerful set of tools that will last me for years to come.One last note . I 've read about some wobble issues but I can say mine has hardly any wobble even with long bit . Might be a hit and miss thing to be honest . My only grip is that it did not come with the belt clip out of the box . The standard drill does so I figured this should as well . No biggie but it is the little things that bug me sometimes .	1
Let 's start out with the fact that I 'm a casual DIY'er . For me , this product is overkill , so I had a professional handyman and a relative who 's an advanced DIY'er give me their impressions of this hammer drill.It packs great torque . There 's plenty of power -- and power to spare , because it comes with a second battery so you can keep one at full charge at all times while you 're working with the other battery.Along with the power and the heavy-duty battery comes some weight . It 's great for most applications , but a pro might feel it 's a little too heavy if he/she has to keep it upright for a long time while working construction , drywall , etc.The keyless chuck is great and very convenient . The hand grip is solid and supportive , and the switch/power trigger is well located for comfortable use.All major functions checked out extremely well : drill , hammerdrill , and driver.Highly recommended !	1
I bought this to replace a 10 year old Makita that had a lot of use and I thought was a pretty good drill but battery replacement was becoming a hassle and expensive . I am stunned by how much better this DeWalt is . Have all cordless drills gotten this good after 10 years ? I do n't know but WOW ! My first major project using it was to build a shed in which I pretty much fastened together exclusively with 2 to 3 1/2 '' screws . Absolutely no problem , and I only went through 3 battery charges . It 's amusing that it comes with a fast charger when it takes me a week to run the battery down . Amazing.Awesome torque , awesome battery life , awesome chuck , it 's a winner.Update : I was so impressed by this drill that I went out and bought their 20V impact driver and circular saw . Both are very impressive as well . I never thought I 'd say this but I 'm done with corded power hand tools .	1
It 's built well , works with my other tool batteries . I purchased this toll and the saw in the kit form , and the rest as bear tools to save money .	1
I have had an older Makita cordless for almost 10 years now . I love that drill . It always had an impressive amount of torque and would last a good long time . But this drill blows it away . The torque on this is unbelievable and the little details are what make this drill great . The LED light is really handy and the ergonomics of the drill are superb.I ca n't recommend this drill enough . It has everything you want in a cordless drill:1 . Plenty of torque2 . Great `` ease of use features '' ( LED , Keyless chuck , good balance , etc ) 3. the battery lats a long time4 . it charges fast5 . the trigger is responsive and allows for good speed controlThe downside to the drill is the case is kinda cheap , although it seems like it would last for a while in the back of a truck , but to really make a drill for this price , they should have given it a slightly better case to handle the rigors of the back of a construction truck ... Otherwise , very impressive new 20v line of tools . New batterys have finally made a nice leap to power tools making them last longer and giving them more power in a light weight package .	1
I used this to drill in tho my cinderblock basement wall . NO trouble whatsoever . Made what could have been a bi-ahtch of a job to a piece of cake . Plenty of power . I got a great deal too , so it 's best to price shop this by model number , but be careful the 980 is NOT a hammer drill . I made that mistake and had to return that and get this . The 985 is DEFINITELY worth the extra bucks .	1
Better Ergonomics : This drill feels right in the hand , better balance . By getting rid of the battery stem they gained freedom to design a more ergonomically shaped handle , which I really like . They also lost compatibility with the older XRP pod type batteries , but I much prefer the newer form factor battery . The slide in battery is much more compact and easier to install and remove . This drill is lighter than the 18v XRP drill , mainly due to reduced battery weight . You 'll notice that on the job for sure , and it 's a welcome change . Overall the ergonomics are much improved.Longer Run Time : The 3 Ah battery has 25 % more capacity for longer run time between charges than the 2.4A batteries of the 18V XRP series . And because they are lithium , they do n't have the rapid self discharge of NiCd or NiMh batteries . So you can not use the drill for a month , and it still has charge , but my older batteries would need a refresh . Big improvements , to me.Some Cons : These are really 18v batteries , not 20V -- says so on the box . Dewalt says they call it 20V to avoid confusion with the older 18v XRP line . I find it misleading . I hate to quibble -- these are fine products , big improvements , but I have always trusted Dewalt to be trustworthy . Makes me wonder ... . Another claim is up to 1000 recharges . I 'll believe that when I see it . I typically get 300-500 charges on a lithium battery before it dies , so 1000 is hard to believe , but let 's hope.How you use them can affect battery life . For best battery life , keep the battery cool , not in a hot truck cab if you can avoid it . Lithium batteries degrade faster with heat . Do n't leave them sitting in the charger . And never run it all the way down until the tool stalls . For some reason , Lithium batteries do n't like that . I 'm told there is a shut off in the battery when the battery is close to drained , a safety factor , but why push it ? I 'm not trying to start a debate here , but it 's true that Makita ( and Milwaukee , Bosch , Ryobi , Rigid ) have had this same slide battery style for several years . They are all popular for the reasons mentioned , and I 'm glad Dewalt updated the battery to the slide format , finally . I think competition is a good thing , it keeps them all making improvements and the customer wins.When I checked these out at the Big Box Store , I also looked at the baby brother of this drill , the DCD780 , and I may get it too . It 's much lighter and smaller , and better for those quick jobs like screw driving , assembly/disassembly of things , whenever you just need a light drill without the heavy duty power of this one . Its smaller battery is compatible with the charger and batteries of this one , a convenience.Seems to me there is a lot to like in these new Dewalt `` 20 volt '' tools . The better ergonomics and longer run time are a big win . If you like Dewalt , I think you 'll especially like this new line .	1
Update 8/27/2012 I found the bit holders for the drill and impact driver and a hard case for my DCD985 drill on ebay all 3 items were less than 30.00 $ Dewalt should have given us a choice to pay an extra 30 $ I 'm just glad they make them and we can buy them.Nice drill but I herad this is just 18 volts not 20 Volts . As well no bit storage Says it 's a option but ca n't find the bit storage anywhere I found the belt clip at dewalt.com . as well whats up with the cheap case [ nylon ] I have an old dewalt 12 volt steel case guess I 'll have to dig it up and see f it will fit . Like I had to do with my 18 volt cordless sawzall with a hard case . when I bought my new dewalt coreded sawsaz with that cheap nylon case ... . Think dewalt should give us a choice of hard and cheap nylon cases , , , I know I 'd pay a bit more for a hard case.As well can anyone here tell what ah means and if 3.0 ah is better than 1.5ah the 1.5 is less expensive and it comes with a hard case . any help would be appreacited . TY Randy FYI The ah stands for amp hours the 3.0 last twice as long running the tool than the 1.5 does ... Please correct me if I 'm wrong .	1
First , I have to say , `` This is one impressive piece of equipment '' ! Very powerful ! Recently started building a new house and used this to drill our stringer holes through the studs for electrical . It is extremely strong without any bog-down . Some of the holes where through the corners and top plates and it had no problem at all.This drill has lots of power and torque.I was impressed that we were able to use it right out of the box . It comes with two rechargable batteries and a charger . Both batteries were charged and ready to go.I love the hammer-drill feature . It goes through cement like butter , without any hesitation.All-in-all , I am excited about this discovery and look forward to years of putting this drill to work . This has become my new best work buddy. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Updated : 10.26.2011This drill is a workhorse and gets used everyday since I received it . There are no signs of loss of torque and the batteries still hold their charge.I 've hung all of my Sheetrock ( about 2300 sq ft ) , Fiberrock ( about 120 sq ft ) , over ninety 3/4 '' drilled anchors into the concrete slab and lots of other holes and screws.As I said before , `` This is one impressive piece of equipment '' ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Updated : 07.29.2013I had to come back an do an update , just to let everyone know that this drill is still running strong . It has far outlasted any previous Bosch or Hitachi drill I 've had and I use it almost everyday and I use this drill hard . Even the batteries have lasted this long without wavering in power loss . It just does n't get any better than this . DeWalt has really outdone themselves with this one.This drill is truly my best work buddy .	1
My company currently has two of these drills and the guys love them . The battery life is great and the light on the battery that lets you know how much of a charge remains is a big help . Personally I never found a cordless drill with a hammer function that was worth a spit . Then I tried this gun . Let me tell you it can go head to head with my Milwaukee . The 20volt battery gives this drill the guts to chew through some concrete ( small hole under a 5/8 '' ) Honestly last week when I was cleaning out my truck I removed my 1/2 '' milwaukee hammer drill and put it in the shop , No need to cary it any more.Also the chuck in this drill really grabs the bit which is important for a hammer drill . I had one key-less chuck on a hammer drill years ago that would constantly work loose after a few minutes of drilling . Not this one it really grabs the bits . Better-yet it motor locks in place when you start to tighten the chuck , This lets you really bear-down on the chuck.Over all a work horse of drill . Nice job Dewalt !	1
I think my favorite thing about this drill over the other ones I 've used is that the battery lasts really long on this one . Other things to note is that the light is much brighter and the wider collar is easier to turn to release/tighten the bit . The hammer setting is nice too if you 're drilling through something that has layers with different hardness that makes the drill stop for a second as it goes through them . I do n't even notice them anymore .	1
Let me preface this by saying , I 'm a girl . I had a different 9.6 volt drill that I had been using for the past few years and it did pretty much everything I needed ( some things easier than others ) until the squirrel decided to move into my dryer vent and I needed to put up a cover on my brick house . Needless to say , my little drill could n't begin to drill into the brick . So , when I saw this , I decided to give it a try.The first thing I noticed were the heavy duty latches on the case and I thought , `` Wow , this looks like a heavy duty 'man drill ' case . '' I was thrilled when I took the drill out to find that it was n't heavy at all and the battery packs , being lithium ion , were much smaller than my current drill 's battery pack . Overall , this drill weighs about the same or a little less than my less powerful drill and is easily light enough for a 5'4 '' girl to use . I read the directions ( which were clear and about as simple as possible ) , put the battery in , and pulled the trigger . HOLY COW ! I quickly sat it down thinking maybe this was too much drill for me ! A few days later , I decided it was time to replace the 2X4 in my fence that had insect damage and to try out my new drill . I was screwing 4 '' screws through a 2x4 into a 4x4 without any kind of pre-drilling and they were going in like the wood was butter . The drill had so much power , but even with all the power , was n't stripping the screws out . Once my fence was finished , I realized I was in love with `` The Man Drill '' as it is now known . There is no way my old drill could have handled those long screws without a battle . My mind immediately went to all the household projects I had done in the past where I struggled with a drill that was n't powerful enough ( hanging mini-blinds , installing child locks into my oak cabinets , etc . ) and thought about how much easier those projects would have been if I had had `` The Man Drill '' then.In the past , I have always had issues with my drill battery being dead . I know I 'm not really supposed to , but I got to the point where I just kept it plugged in all the time which was very hard on the battery . I love that this drill comes with two batteries and a charging station . If I have a big job or if one of the batteries is nearly dead , I can be charging the other one while using what is left in the first battery and not lose work time.So , `` The Man Drill '' is now my new favorite power tool . I will be selling the old drill in my next yard sale . I 'm also looking for new things around the house that require drilling so I can play with it . I highly recommend this drill !	1
This Drill Excellent from several aspects.Lightweight.Has excellent torque.Provider by two batteries and operates long a time . Was used by the period of April , 2012 but still works with excellent efficiency .	1
I read a bunch of reviews about this drill prior to purchasing it and I was hesitant to buy having read the comments about it having a wobbly chuck . I did experience the wobble initially , but I either do n't notice it at this point or it 's gone away.Overall , this drill is amazing . It 's stood up to every task an average DIYer could throw at it . The batteries last for a really long time ( do n't have exact numbers ) even when stored for extended periods of time , and they charge quickly . The torque and power have been adequate for my needs and I 've never found myself reaching for something else that was more powerful to get the job done.I have large hands but I did not find this drill to be small in any way - I 'm able to comfortably hold it and it 's well balanced . It 's nice that it 's small because the drill fits well inside my toolbag for those quick trips to family members houses to fix things.The belt clip does n't seem too useful to me because the drill swings around and weighs my pants down ... .the clip is removable though.The LED can be hit or miss . It 's not positioned in the best of places ( since the chuck usually blocks it ) but it 's come in handy a few times .	1
I think I 've just found my new weapon of choice ! ! Presently I 'm using : # 1 ) `` Pansy '' , a 9.6V Dewalt drill who handles small screws and pre-drilling .She 's sort of wimpy and has atendency to leave the drill bits behind in the wood. # 2 ) `` Big bad Bob '' an 18V Porter-Cable who handles deck screws and forsner bits but weighs a ton andsometimes requires two hands for control ( I 'm 4'11 '' and of the female persuasion ) I think this little beauty can put both of them out to pasture . The chuck is GENIUS once I stopped pinching my fingers between the sleeve and the body of the drill . This tiny thing takes 1/2 bits ? Incredible ! The belt clip is a nice touch and can be reversed if you 're left-handedThe work light is a handy feature and turns on with the trigger , turns off 20 seconds after you release the trigger.The case is very sturdy and has an interlocking lip which should make it dirt and water resistant.The manufacturers description and the other reviewers cover the technical aspects of the drill very well so there is n't much for me to add.Well , alright , just one nit-picky question . If they can develop a tool this nice why ca n't they come up with a decent instruction manual and maybe a storage slot or clip in the lid of the case ? Their answer : `` No one ever reads it anyway . '' Wonder why ? The manual is a chintzy , road mappy thing in three languages . You have to keep folding and flipping back and forth to find what you want . How long before it will be tossed in a corner or under a work bench never to be seen again ?	1
18 month update : Performing excellently . Batteries hold their charge even after months of shelf-sitting.First , the disclaimers : ( 1 ) My needs for power tools are relatively modest . While I have a house , my do-it-yourself endeavors are not extensive due to shortfalls in my own time , tools and talent ( depending on the project ) . ( 2 ) With my limitations as a handyman acknowledged : I can and do take on those projects in my DIY wheelhouse . Many of these rely on what is unquestionably the first power tool purchase most people will ever make : a drill . ( 3 ) It 's been at least five years since we had a working battery powered drill in the house . Most will be familiar with the reasons why : rapidly depleted batteries , long charging time and limited power when the going gets tough . For these reasons , I had been using a corded drill exclusively for a long time . ( 4 ) The real test of a tool like this comes over time . Two years ago I broke the cord on a Black and Decker drill that I 'd owned since the 70s . While demanding decades of use probably unrealistic , the real test of this drill will come in five to ten years , when I can see if it still works ( and at this price : the answer better be `` yes '' ) .When this drill arrived , I did not have a significant project to test it on . The following is based on a series of tests using different bit sizes , drilling a variety of hardwood , softwood and metal samples , and screwing/unscrewing a variety of screw types in multiple locations.How does this drill get to five stars ? Pros : -Rapid battery charging . Upon arrival , each of the two battery packs had sufficient charge to power the drill for drilling and screwing . While I was not able to fully deplete them , I powered the drill through a series of drilling/screwing tests using each . Time to return to fully charged was about 20m minutes , which I expect to be more than adequate to keep the drill running on the other battery back even in high load situations.-Excellent balance and feel . This drill stands firmly upright on the battery pack . It 's weight is well distributed and its easy to maneuver to get at work that may not be directly in front of you . Start and stopping are as gradual -- or as instantaneous -- as you 'd like when you depress the variable-speed trigger.-Two speed transmission , 15 torque settings and forward/reverse are available to get the right power level and direction of spin to your job. -- The case holds the drill , battery packs and charger unit.-Thoughtful extras : -- The integrated LED light adds the extra illumination you always seem to need ( no matter how well-lit you thought your workplace was ) -- The bitholder at the bottom stores bits parallel to the side of the battery . Having this there keeps them out of your pockets ( and mouth ! ) Cons : I can only offer two minor gripes about this product . They in no way detract from its overall functionality , but you should be aware of them : -the latches on the case are made from extremely thin metal . While the edges are not razor sharp , they are surprisingly sharp , and the resulting feel is someplace between cheap and potentially dangerous ( if you press really really hard ! ) .-the included user guide is not printed in a booklet form , but instead on both sides of single sheet of paper . This guide is roughly the same size as the road maps we used to keep in the glove box in the days before GPS ... and about as annoying to refold . Why DeWalt chose this instead of a booklet is anybody 's guess , but its not convenient for reference and has a PITA factor in refolding.Assuming it stands up the challenge of long-term use in the hands of a not-so-skilled user : buy with confidence . There 's plenty I do n't know about tools , but know enough that going cheap means buying often ...	1
I received this drill via the Amazon Vine reviewer program , which frankly surprised me as I am not much of a DIYer . Being female and having a husband who 's not into projects , I had to seek out a way to test drive the Dewalt DCD780C2 20V before reviewing it.My Test : Dismantling a 10 year old wooden playset.I had tried to do it before with manual tools , but quickly gave up as it was just too daunting . Next I purchased a wimpyBlack & Decker GCO14SFB 14-Volt Ni-Cad 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver with Storage Bag and Stud Sensorpackage . I liked the BD product for quick in-house projects , but the battery life was so-so and definitely under-powered for bigger jobs like the playset dismantle.Enter the DEWALT . Obviously up to the task in power with the 20V , it arrived charged and ready to go , with a charger and an extra battery ( also charged when I opened the box ) . For what amounted to probably 40 bolts and screws being removed , this thing powered through without a hic-up and power to spare on the first battery . I was mightily impressed as this is my first professional grade power tool , and I can now see why individuals who do big projects and/or are consistently doing DIY projects , would invest the money in buying this product . Bottom line : It 's great ! While I did n't need it for my project , the LED light is a very cool feature . Ergonomically speaking ... it fits great in my small hands . The case is not super heavy-duty , but it gets the job done . I like that it holds both ( 1.5 Ah lithium-ion ) batteries , the A/C charger ( compatible with the 12V max and 20V , is dual compatible ) and the compact ( 7.5 '' ) drill/driver . NOTE : 3.0 Ah lithium ion batteries will also work with this drill/driver - sold separately.For a woman who lifts heavy weights in the gym 4x 's a week , this tool was still what I would consider to be 'heavy ' for overhead work . I think most users of this tool would not see that 3.5 pounds as a big deal , but not having much to compare it too , it seemed heavy to me after an hour or so of work.The drill comes with a standard 3 year warranty , 1 year free service contract and a 90-day money back guarantee . The 1.5 Ah lithium ion batteries come with a 2 year free service guarantee.The 5-star rating is well deserved for this tool and its packaging . This is a fantastic drill at a fair price . It would be an excellent quality 'go to ' tool for plumbers , installers of various types , remodelers , woodworkers , and other professionals or hardcore hobbyist , DIY'ers .	1
After owning many cordless drills , so far , this is the best drill I have ever owned . It is light , compact and powerful . I would buy this drill again if this one got stolen !	1
It 's immediately apparent when you first use this drill that it is way more powerful than the drills a casual user might pick up for common household chores . This can handle big projects , and the battery lasts a very long time . I 'm not expert on these kinds of things - I had to ask a neighbor what to do about getting drill bits for this to use , but that ended up being simple enough . I also really like the light that automatically turns on during use and off when idle . It 's a nice touch that shows how much attention they paid to what users really need.If all you do is put together the occasional shelf from Ikea , you probably do n't need something this strong . But if you 've got larger projects , especially outdoor stuff , where using a drill with a cord can be a hassle , I think this Dewalt drill is a great choice .	1
I received this for father 's day as an upgrade to my old 18v DeWalt . What a difference ! The size is just right . It feels good and balanced in the hand . I had thought about buying and extra mini screwdriver for little jobs , but this 20v is so light and compact another purchase would be redundant . Though it is smaller than my old DeWalt it does n't lack in power and torque.The LED is a nice addition and helps a bit in those dark spaces .	1
I purchased this drill/driver based on a LOT of research , reviews , and shopping to find the best value . It arrived ahead of delivery estimate , performs very well , and drives some heavy duty materials . Only have used it twice so far but each time I put it through two full days of continuous use , day one the battery lasted the entire day ! Day two , after a brief charge the battery lasted until I was finished with the drill . Time will tell .	1
This is a very nice unit . It is not extremely heavy so it makes it very easy to use . Excellent quality . We have purchased a number of these for our company and never had any problems with any of them .	1
This guy 's a hoss ! Dewalt historically has made top quality products . In fact , you 'll find that most all of my power tools are Dewalt . This Li-Ion battery powered drill is no doubt the leader of the pack . Plenty of power and light weight .	1
Powers through everything , even when using spade bits , forstner bits , or large diameter hole saws . RPM control is good , even at low speed.The belt clip allows use while up a ladder . That was a big plus.My only gripe is that the LED light is obscured by the chuck . Unless your drill or driver bit is at least 8 '' long , the chuck will cast a shadow right where you need the light . I 'm tempted to tape over the light because it makes the contact point dark by contrast .	1
Be still my beating heart ! When this drill arrived at my home , we opened the box and just stood in silence for a few minutes.I 've been happily using my Black & Decker Power Driver - with an occasional outing of my corded drill - for decades . I 've also been the family-handyperson for those decades , working with seriously underpowered tools , and severe hand arthritis . Given these limitations , I was delighted to try the Dewalt Compact Drill/Driver.The Dewalt comes in a molded , hinged case , with both batteries charged and ready to use . The case has a small hole for a quick zip-tie lock , or you could pad-lock the handle . The case is well-balanced for carrying , and is fairly compact.The Drill is well-balanced to hold and use ( remember , this is coming from someone with arthritic hands , so I 'm a harsh judge of poorly designed tools ) . An LED light comes on whenever the power is activated . It 's easy to change bits , and easy to use the drill on slow or high speed , forward or reverse - flips with the usual switch , which also locks the drill . My first project was drilling drainage holes in the bottom of five 5-gallon buckets for growing potatoes . My friend used it to complete installation of a door latch in the garage.All of the parts work smoothly , with nicely engineered clicks , and clear yellow/black markings on the drill . It 's easy to see how the battery fits on the base or the charger . Everything is good-sized ; no itty-bitty switches , markings , or dials . There 's a clip on the drill for hanging from your belt , or on a tool wall.It 's my first Dewalt tool , and I 'm impressed . Wo n't be my last . Perfect tool for the advanced handyman , contractor , or a woman who needs a real drill . I 'm retiring my beloved B & D power driver !	1
+++ THE PROS +++ [ + UTILIZES LI-ION TECH ] : Li-Ion offers more power in a smaller/lighter package , vs. NiCad and NiMH . [ + LED GUIDE LIGHT ] : Positioned above the trigger . Turns on when you pull the trigger and auto-off after 20-seconds of non-use [ + 2-SPEED MOTOR ] : High speed ( up to 2,000rpm ) for drilling , Low/Variable speed ( up to 600rpm ) with clutch for driving [ + LIGHT WEIGHT ] : The 1.5A batteries weigh 12oz each . With battery inserted the total drill weight is 3.5lbs [ + 2 X 1.5A BATTERIES ] : With each 1.5A battery capable of providing several hours of runtime , you 're not actually giving up much runtime at all to have a lighter drill ( vs. having a single 3.0A battery ) . That , in combination with the quick-charger being able to charge a battery faster than it takes to drain one ... You could actually keep working with the drill on-stop , perpetually . [ + DUAL VOLTAGE QUICK CHARGER ] : Charges a battery in 30min and if you happen to also use Dewalts ' 12V MAX line , this charger will charge those batteries as well . [ + INCLUDES HEAVY-DUTY CARRY CASE ] : With the included belt-clip , the drill could just as easily be a part of your tool belt or be in your tool box/chest . But if you like having a place for everything and everything in its ' place , then the included case keeps your 20v kit together nicely and should be strong enough for the job site -- - THE CONS -- - [ - ACTUALLY 18V SYSTEM ] : At full charge and checked with no load , you get the 20V reading . The actual in-use voltage is 18V . But so as to not confuse this new line with their other 18V lines that do n't use Li-Ion , Dewalt calls these the 20V `` MAX '' system . So you 'll need to remove the voltage difference , when doing comparison shopping , to other 18V systems . *** FINAL THOUGHTS ***I 've got big hands ( XL size gloves ) and find this drill to be comfortable to hold , well balanced and even only after a short time of use the lighter weight is appreciated . The included instructions warn that using the variable speed of the drill can shorten the life of the motor , so it 's especially nice having a clutch so you can just run the motor full tilt all the time and have the clutch kick-in at the right amount of tightness/torque you want.This is a new product line , based on the long time success of the 18V line and brought up to current technology and ergonomics . Well recommended .	1
It was just what I expected , except it came with two batteries , not one ! I think the price was on the high end , but it is an outstanding piece of equipment and something that works well is worth having	1
Like many guys I 've spent time doing construction . My first cordless drill was the original Makita , which lasted me through a couple of battery replacements . Since I 'd gotten back to a desk and had lost the wrist strength to a use pro grade cordless , I replaced it with aBlack & Decker VPX1212X Li-Ion 14.4-Volt VPX Drill Driver , which is light enough to use and powerful enough to drive screws through 2x4s . For bigger jobs , though its batteries did n't last long enough and took too long to recharge.Enter the DeWALT . With its lithium ion batteries , it 's light enough for me to use for hours . The batteries last for hours , too . I spent all day putting up a fence . The first battery got me through lunch and into the afternoon . I gave out before the second battery did about time to put some fish on the grill . It has plenty of power . It is n't an impact driver drill , which makes is slightly less powerful . On the plus side of that it has an adjustable clutch . When I get tired I rely on that a lot to not overdrive screws . It has two speeds . High is plenty fast enough to run a drill . Low has a variable speed , which is nice on delicate work . The handle is just right for my med-large glove size and can be used by those with smaller hands.The drill has all the little features I 'd expect on a pro model . There 's an LED light , a lanyard clip and a belt clip , as well as a clip to hold a screw bit . One nice touch is that the belt clip and screw bit holder are removable and can be switched for left handed users . It has a 1/2 inch chuck.I have a 25 year old DeWALT belt sander and a Porter Cable ( same company ) orbital sander that are both still going strong and have always considered DeWalt to make rugged and dependable tools . This has a 3 year limited warrante and a 1 year full one . As a home owner I expect this to last , though lithium ion batteries have a definite shelf life limit .	1
This is an excellent compact drill . It 's lightweight , a little less than 3-1/2 pounds . The ergonomics are excellent , it feels great in your hand . It 's easy to use overhead , or with your arm extended.It has two speeds , 0-600 rpm and 0-2000 rpm . The 2000 max rpm is fast for a cordless drill . 2000 rpm is great for drilling small holes , soft woods , or plastics . The faster the speed you can run , the faster you can drill the hole . ( of course you do n't want to use a higher than recommended rpm for the material or drill bit you 're using ) The drill has a 1/2 '' chuck that runs dead true . I 've seen a couple of reviews that talk about chuck runout , but my drill and the two we have at work run dead true . I take excellent care of my drill , but the two at work see hard usage without any problems.The drill has 15 clutch settings to give you great control when driving screws . It comes with two 1.5 Ah lithium ion batteries that are small , light , yet powerful . The batteries charge in 30 minutes , have excellent runtime and hold their charge well while stored . Even the included hard case is well thought out . It is compact and holds everything securely . The drill also comes with a belt clip and a bit holder . Both are removable and can be assembled on either side of the drill.The drill has an LED light that stays on about 20 seconds after you release the trigger . The placement of the light could be a little better as the light is somewhat blocked at the point of use by the chuck . The Bosch compact cordless drill ( DDS181-02 ) has the light down at the base of the handle and is angled up to a point out in front of the chuck . That method works better . I had originally purchased the Bosch , but took it back and replaced it with this DeWALT . Do n't get me wrong , the Bosch is a very good drill with plenty of power . To me It just did n't have the fit , feel , or build quality of the DeWALT.Additional ( and maybe even useful ) information : This is not the most powerful drill in its class . It may have traded some torque for higher speed . I think that its a good trade off in a compact drill.DeWALT is bringing the assembly of this model drill back to the USA ( North Carolina ) . They will have information on their website . I 've had mine for almost a year so it is n't USA assembled.DeWALT has a new 20 volt max brushless compact drill model DCD790C2 . Be sure to check it out before you close the deal on a new cordless drill.Also , if you 're looking at compact drill drivers you may want to check out the 12 volt offerings from DeWALT , Milwaukee , Bosch , and Makita . They are less powerful , but smaller and lighter .	1
This is an amazing drill . With the new design grip and the lighter feel , you have total control of this drill . The one problem that I have is the drill box is so compact , you have no room to place drill bits or common & phillip head screw drivers . Instead of having to carry my drill and a case of drill bits , I ended up removing my old Dewalt 18v drill from its carrier and placed the new drill & hardware in the larger case . Not only does everything fit snug but I was able to put a small pouch of drill & screwdriver bits inside.I also noticed that with the older Dewalt drills you could tighten & loosen a bit by just runnig the drill and you would lock the bit in place or remove a bit . I found that when I do this with the new drill , the bit becomes loose after a while . All you need to do is hand tighten the bit in place and it works fine.I had to either replace my 18v batteries or purchase the compact Dewalt DCD780C2 . When I felt this new drill in my hand and the power it puts out , I knew I made the right choice .	1
I purchased this to replace an older Dewalt portable drill , which is a favorite of mine . Batteries are now expensive and a problem for it , so I decided rather than investing in new batteries , I 'd invest in an all-new drill , especially as li-ion and the brushless motors were highly regarded by reviews pretty much everywhere.I 'll just be straight about this ... . it 's really an excellent drill . I was afraid it would be heavy , it is feather-light . I was n't sure about the battery power , it has plenty of power . And I thought perhaps the size would be awkward , it 's actually smaller than my 12V Dewalt that it replaced.I was drilling out a brass cleat in a deck , and it powered through like it was corded drill ( but to be clear , this does not have the power of a corded drill , but it 's closer than any other portable I 've used ) .If I have one complaint , it 's the chuck . I was using large bits that had the chuck opened up completely , and it struggled to grip onto them . However , this was hard core drilling into concrete and metal with a lot of vibration , but even so , that did not impress me about the drill.As far as people with complaints about the bits not running true , I did n't notice anything particularly bad about this drill . Perhaps my applications are n't sensitive to this flaw . Or maybe Dewalt fixed it . I 'm not sure.I would purchase this again .	1
This is the drill I needed a month ago when I was taking apart a play set I had built for my son eight years ago ! Instead I purchased a Hitachi DS120DVF3 cordless drill which did n't have enough power for about 1/3 of the screws and I ended up dragging out my 100 ' extension cord and using my electric drill to finish the project.Needless to say this more expensive and more powerful drive works much better than that one . I just ran a side by side test and the DeWalt drill easily out-performed my cheaper Hitachi . The Li-Ion battery lasts much longer as well and the hand grip is actually smaller than the Hitachi which makes it easier for me to hold on to . It does weigh a bit more than the Hitachi -- but I can handle that.I know DeWALT is a quality name ( my ex-husband always insisted on buying DeWalt when possible ) and this one does n't disappoint with the nice extra features like the belt clip , clip to hold a bit , and the built in light ( which was a pleasant surprise ) ! The two speeds and numerous clutch adjustments provides plenty of ways to adjust the power and speed.I also like how compact the case box is -- it easily fits the drill , extra battery , and recharger , but the overall dimensions are small ( 4.5x10x15 ) which means it packs well and does n't take up any extra space -- whether that is on a shelf , or in a larger tool box.Bottom line : This is a nice top-of-the-line drill . I feel like building something . . .	1
The power and torque of this drill rival any cordless drill I have ever used . There are multiple settings to adjust for torque . The light on the drill has been useful in more than one instance when there would have been insufficient light otherwise . I have used it for simple , around the house jobs such as placing wood screws and drilling pilot holes . This drill does more than I need it to do . It would make a great Father 's Day gift .	1
I 'm not a person that believes that the tool is the beginning and the end . I felt that given any brand tool one could do the job and do the job well . I still feel that way ; here 's the but . If you want to do it faster and better , than get a name brand tool . I chose DeWalt and I 'm very happy.This is my first DeWalt . In a word `` WOW '' . It is smaller , faster , stronger , lighter and will last longer than any thing I had before it . I purchased it thru e-bay because the price was right and my brand new , not a name brand impact driver just did n't have it . I have used this DeWalt a few times and there is no comparison . I 'll give my no name impact driver away.The tool is well thought out , down to one hand bit changes . There are three LED 's that light the way and stay lit for 20 seconds after trigger release . I do wonder if the handle would survive a drop , it seems on the small side . I 'll just trust that DeWalt knows what it 's doing . After buying this impact driver I purchased four more DeWalt 's and will review each.You can buy what you want ; I would recommend DeWalt - PERIOD .	1
Have had this unit since the product line launched . It is well built and lightweight . I have . Other dewalt products and like all of them it is robust , has a nice case , and most of my dewalt stuff that is 10 plus years old still runs great . I did not notice any build quality drop off in this unit from the older dewalt stuff , which you sometimes see in other brands these days as they try and maximize profits . The led lights are a nice touch . It is powerful enough for any job around the home . Most importantly if you are a homeowner looking at a unit like this , is that the batteries last over time , even when not used on a constant basis . I completed most . Major projects around my home sometime ago and no the drill is used for the more minor things that pop up every few weeks or longer . The batteries still answer the call with what seems to be the same power and run time as when it was new .	1
This impact driver comes with two 20 volt lightweight lithium ion batteries , a battery charger and a case . It is small , light weight , powerful and is a perfect fit in the hand . Bits are simply pushed into the chuck and are securely held in place . Removal is accomplished with a slight foward pull of the outer chuck ring . Simplicity personified . It has three LED lights which provide an unencumbered view . Using a standard 1 '' bit makes it easier to work in tight places . This is a suprisingly powerful tool for its size . The batteries are of the slide-in type so insertion and removal in the driver and the charger are easily handled . This is a highly recommended addition to any ones tool collection . I have a number of Dewalt tools and this is one of the best if not the best.Although the tool is a masterful creation the user information is in the dumbest format ever conceived by man ( or woman although , in honesty , I never met a woman that that would do anything that stupid ) . Instead of the convenient sized multi-page user manual that most knowledgeable tool suppliers provide , DeWalt has decided that all information should be provided on a single sheet of paper measuring approximately 1/2 acre . One would need a pair of field glasses to read all the information . By hooking a back hoe to my tractor I was able to lop off the non-English portion and cut the sheet down to about a 1/4 acre . It is inconcievable to me how a company that can create such a fine tool can also win the award for the most idiotic instruction sheet in the history of user instruction provisioning . Maybe they save one or two cents on a $ 220 item . Go figure .	1
This is an awesome tool . It 's power and compactness are unrivaled . The led lights are a welcome add-on . Do buy !	1
This is one spectacular hand tool ! I was keen to use it as a drill when I first got my hands on it , but quickly discovered that my old drill bits of various sizes were incompatible with the 1/4-inch chuck . No problem . I came back to Amazon.com and bought the Makita T-01389 62-Piece Impact Drill-Driver Bit Set , which works perfectly with the DeWalt impact driver.What do I like about it ? The torque is phenomenal and drives screws into wood that would otherwise require the drilling of a pilot hole first . The three LEDs are a life-saver when working in dimly lit spots and I especially appreciate the stay-on feature after I release the trigger.What is conspicuously absent ? Some kind of torque setting to prevent over-torquing screws and bolts . In my judgment , that 's what makes this a four-star product instead of earning the full five stars.That said , the DeWalt impact driver is my new most favorite tool .	1
Having mostly used standard non impact drills most of my life , I was really impressed with the better driving force of one of these , a contractor brought to a job to do for us . The impact drive is so much more forceful a drive ; and a friend of ours Clair Davis , just sears by his DeWALT tools , preferring them over most everything else . I have to agree with him for the most part , now that we have had to use differing tools , side by side.I like the 1.5 Ah model , the 1/4 '' drive is good or all our intended purposes we have encountered around the homestead the past thirty years or so , and the 20-volt does have the drive power , and run time we are happy to have achieved.I can definitely recommend the 1.5 Ah or even th 3.0 Ah our friend has ; for most anything a homeowner will need .	1
This driver excels as a compact unit with a minimum of fuss . Charge and go . I find this particular unit to be very handy and wonderful to use in tight spaces . So far I 've had good experience with the batteries . The new lithium ion batteries are the way to go . The supplied 1.5 amp hour batteries have been sufficient for my DIY activities , providing plenty of power to get jobs done , and holding charges well between jobs . The trigger activated LED light is great . The charger and kit box are fine.When you buy a cordless tool , you are buying into the battery system and a whole family of tools . The 20v battery , and this entire line for that matter , represent a new generation of cordless tools for Dewalt . They 've been selling the 18v line for a while and it has a big following , especially among contractors . The new 20v tools are not backward compatible with 18v , but I believe Dewalt will be supporting the installed base of 18v tools for a while . The 20v batteries CAN use the 12v Max charger . Do not be confused by the 20v Max marketing . These have the same voltage as the earlier system ( maximum 4 volts per cell , 5 cells per battery , dropping to 3.6 volts when in use ... 18 volts ) , but the electronics are updated and the batteries have higher amp hours ( currently $ 99 for 3 amp hours and $ 69 for 1.5 amp hours ) . The old batteries were nicads ; these new batteries are lithium ion . Dewalt moved the electronics from the battery to the tool , supposedly making the batteries less expensive.I have not had the opportunity to compare this driver to the current crop of lithium ion powered drivers from Dewalt 's competitors ( who include Milwaukee Tools , Makita , Bosch , and Rigid ) . Apologies to those of you looking for a shoot out.If you are not familiar with impact drivers , please read the section below . If you are interested in a more generally useful cordless drill ( i.e. , applicable to a wider number of jobs ) , I strongly recommend the Dewalt DCD 980 or DCD 985 . If you just want a drill for infrequent general purpose household use , get a decent corded 1/2 '' variable speed drill.Here are the basic differences between a drill , impact driver and hammer drill : -A standard drill just rotates.-An impact driver rotates and applies a rotational tapping.-A hammer drill rotates and hammers the drill along the axis of rotation ( i.e. , into the material ) .Impact drivers are at their best in turning screws and nuts , and they are fantastic if you are trying to remove a frozen screw . Imagine nearly stripping a screw and thinking you might need to drill it out , and then using an impact driver that turns it like you 're moving through butter . Impact drivers are not my first choice for drilling of any kind , though the manufacturers are happy to sell you small diameter drill bit sets for impact drivers.Impact drivers place increased stress on the bits and use a hexagonal shank . You should purchase bits that are designed for impact drivers . None are included in this kit . The various manufacturers have their own names for these lines of bits ( e.g. , `` impact ready '' ) but these are not proprietary systems ( though you do need to get a 1/4 '' hex shank for this tool ) . Right now I 'm partial to the Milwaukee Tools shockwave bits , but your mileage will vary . You may want to check out the selection at your local hardware store first before you purchase . Bits are a significant investment . You can also buy adaptors that allow you to use a wider variety of bits ( e.g . round shank ) , but that starts to turn the tool ( or drill bit ) into something it was not designed to be in the first place.Cheers	1
Relatively light weight , especially considering how much torque it has . It is a tool that I really enjoy using and wonder why I was using a drill with a cord to cinch screw nails .	1
Once I got over the fact that I spent so much on a 1/4 inch impact I focused on the positives . This is a lightweight , powerful and compact little impact . Works great for around the house and for doing odds and ends . I would not recommend if you are thinking this is going to be a & # 34 ; strong & # 34 ; impact to get off tough bolts . Just does n't have the power . But it works as described and is an impressive entry level type small impact .	1
I must confess I 've never used an impact driver before and I really did n't know what to expect ... .This tool is lightweight , with a long lasting battery and enough torque to perform every single job you can think of ... To show how strong it is , once I took my car to it 's annual visit to the mechanics ... Just for a routine check-up ... . Everything went fine ... .They switched my front wheels with the back ones and did not ( believe me ! ! ! ) align the car after that ... . Obviously the car just did n't go strait anymore ... I tried to take tha car back to the shop in order for them to fix this issue , but as I live in a small town , they were closed during the weekend . So I decided I would do it myself . I used this impact driver to remove one of the wheels , replace it with the spare , remove the other wheel , change them ... I did it with all the four wheels and the battery did n't even seem to discharge ... .So , if you want a good but compact lightweight impact driver , that would be my choice .	1
I should preface this review by saying I 'm not a professional construction worker , just a week-end tinkerer who does projects around the house and yard . I previously owned a Makita cordless drill and I do n't have much good to say about it -- nothing worse than a 20 minute expedition through the crawlspace to find out that your battery is dying on the job.Nothing like that with the amazing 3.0 Ah battery on this puppy . Lots of torque , and the longest run time I 've ever seen in a cordless power tool . Charging takes an hour or two . Since I do n't use it that often , I really appreciate that the battery does n't discharge when not in use -- although since it 's a Li-Ion it should not be stored fully charged for an extended period of time . Another benefit : it 's very lightweight for the amount of power it stores , especially compared to those old nicad batteries.Highly recommended ; this is a quality tool .	1
A compact , balanced extremely powerful tool . The three lights are bright , reverse button on the head , comfortable traction grip . The size/power is what 's really astounding . The head of the drill is the same length as the battery and weighted/balanced perfectly ( picture is accurate portrayal of size ) . DeWALT continues to provide excellence in the quality products offered to it 's consumers and this latest addition is no exception . My father in law had major tool envy when I showed it to him , he owns a custom drapery business and each week will have to go and install something himself for one reason or another , and currently uses a DeWALT drill and an electric impact driver . There was nothing that he did not like about this tool . Actually he LOVED it ! Blown away by it 's power , particularly liked the heavy duty belt clip , the 20v ( his drill is less ) and balance /size . Something that we can both agree on for a change !	1
Its seems to be getting harder and harder in finding dependable tools that can hold their own . That is especially true with drills . Like any other guy , I jumped at the opportunity to take the DeWalt DCF885L2 20V Impact Driver for a test drive . After a little over three months use , these are my thoughts.Like other same brand tools that I own , DeWalt battery packs have an initial one to two hour charge . The batteries that came with this driver were ready to go to work . Weighing in at 3.4 lbs , and measuring almost 6 '' front to back , this driver is compact and easily held its own in even the tightest of spaces . Ergonomically , its a tool that 's hard to put down . No more shadowing or poor visibility because this driver is outfitted with ( 3 ) LED lights with a 20 second delay after I release the trigger . The single handed loading feature is sweet . The 1/4 '' hex chuck accepts 1 '' bit tips . The attached belt clip is sturdy and has come in handy on more then one occasion.Juiced with a surprisingly powerful 20V MAX lithium battery pack , its full throttle from the start to finish . At 3200ipm ( Impact Per Minute ) its no light weight . The no load speed comes in at 2800rpm . With this tool it takes practically no time for me to assemble or break down displays and rigging . When charging , the light on the charger will blink on and off during the process . The light will stay illuminated when charging is complete . Unlike other brands , it does n't hurt to leave your battery in the charger.The DeWalt DCF885L2 20V Driver comes packed with ( 2 ) 20V Max lithium Ion 3.0 Ah Battery packs , charger , and a storage case . The manufacturer tacks on a three year limited warranty and a one year free service contract . The company also adds a 90 day money back guarantee . The only thing that it does n't come with is bit tips.Overall , I 'm very impressed with this DeWalt 20V Driver . Without a doubt , its a quality tool built for durability and endurance . I know for me personally , its been a workhorse .	1
I 've been using this tool at work ( automotive ) for a year . This means daily constant use often at it 's limit . Which is a very generous limit . It 's been borrowed by others and found to be indispensable . Even if it does not tighten large hardware ( lugnuts , motor mounts , etc . ) to spec it does a wonderful job of running it up . And it 's loosening power , along with a bit of heat and penetrating oil , has saved many a snapped bolt or stud from happening . ( impacts do n't apply accumulated force like a pull on a long breaker bar will ) The variable speed trigger allows it to be used with the small hardware as well . Unfortunately I 'm here to buy a replacement , but only because I misplaced it . So this is ... its eulogy as well as a review .	1
This is the first 20v driver I 've come across and the first Dewalt product I 've owned . I 'm happy to say I 've been blown away by it 's power and performance.The battery charged quickly and has been holding power for much longer than I ever anticipated.There is a very handy light that remains lit for about 30 seconds after you press it . Very helpful in small dark areas.The only two things I 've missed that my last driver had : a built in level and a magnetic pad to hold bits . Those are very minor things considering how well the drill performs overall .	1
Well I received my Dewalt 20v Impact Drill , `` Amazon style '' fast delivery very well packaged and in great condition , batteries were already charged , so I unpacked it and started using it the very next day , for some reason I feel like the batteries are not lasting more than my Makita set ... I have n't had time to do a side by side comparison , but I 'm planing to do it , I needed to frame a pocket door and it was required that I do it with screws which I did not use that many , then for sheets of sheet rock the following day and I ran out on the first battery ... .. and then the same thing with the second battery ... .so I do n't feel that the 35 % more running power is happening ... ..I will however run a test on Sunday , with a fully charged battery ... ..and see how many screws I can drive with one charge.I have to say that I like this Dewalt Imapct , the size , the weight , the power , the fast 30 minute charger , the 3 LED lights are great , [ my co workers are jealous ] ... ... ... I will update this first review later on.Update : I was able to drive 140 3 inch screws into a double 2x6 boards with one charge , screws were driven 1 right next to each other.I took some pictures but I do n't see a way to insert them here . I 'll take a video tomorrow 10/05/2011Update 2 : After exactly 88 days my drill already started wobbling to the point that is very difficult to drive screws : ( I 'm disappointed , I 'll see what Dewalt can do . Amazon does not allowed for me to return it for the 90 day Dewalt return policy . : ( I like my impact but I 'm disappointed its wobbling after just 88 days.I take good car of my tools specially on the trial period , it was not drop or abused so that 's why I 'm disappointed , specially when it supposed to be a workhorse ... ... ... did I 'm mentioned I 'm disappointed ? : )	1
This review is for the drill . I really like it . Compact and very powerful.You can operate the bit chuck with one hand . The light is helpful and stays on some seconds after releasing the trigger . Drilling in steel and pressing hard unable to slow the drill . I purchased the 3 AH battery and a dead battery should not be a problem . I like the feel of this drill in your hand - it just feels right ! I like the two speed transmission . Having just purchased this drill , still getting to know it - will follow up in a month or two .	1
This electric drill and impact driver set is very high quality , easy to use , and quite convenient due to the battery operation . On the other hand , it is rather heavy , and since the drill can function as an impact driver this paired set may be more suitable for those who need to use an impact driver frequently.Pro : Nice carrying and storage case . The two tools and the battery charger fit in securely.Both tools are very comfortable in the hand.The drill has good capabilities ; two speeds , and the ability to vary the torque by means of a ring around the barrel ( though they recommend that one checks the actual torque with a specific wrench , rather than rely on the settings ) . It is reversible . This is by far the best drill I have ever used.It is easy to put bits into the drill , without a chuck . I like the extra drill bit holder in the handle . There is a snap connector for the impact driver that takes 1/4 inch hex bits.Convenient belt clip on both tools ( although with the weight I 'd suggest a VERY snug belt ) .The impact driver has a nice three LED light that illuminates the work space ; the drill provides a single LED which still manages to do a good job in dim environments.The impact driver is very small and will work well in a constricted space.Two batteries are provided , so if one is only using a single item , a spare battery is ready.Con : Weight . These two are heavy , due to the batteries . One pays for the convenience of not having that power cord.Summary : Very good products , highly recommended . I 'm not sure that the impact driver will be as useful to the average user as the drill . If you need both , this is a great set . Otherwise , you may want to opt for just the drill .	1
I 'm really happy with these tools . The impact driver has plenty of power . The charge last long enough for my needs . With the extra battery and fast charge it 's not a problem . If I needed these for daily use like a carpenter would . I probably would have needed the 3.0 Ah Batteries . The drill works good and it 's easy to change bits .	1
I had no idea what the little impact driver would do , but on my first project , it was more useful than the drill . Also , the 18 -20 power is far better than my old 12 V DeWalt drill . The drill has enough power to drive a 3 & # 34 ; hole saw thru about 6 & # 34 ; of sill beam . I hesitated to give the unit 5 stars because the drill has a problem with drill bits smaller than 3/16 & # 34 ; .. The bit comes loose when it gets stuck in sheetmetal holes , , I do n't do sheetmetal much so am not too concerned . I assume this is because the chuck goes up to 1/2 & # 34 ; and is n't & # 34 ; fine & # 34 ; enough to handle the small bits.Two drills allows me to predrill a hole with the drill and then drive a screw etc with the inpact driver if necessary . The driver is powerful enough , however , to drive the screw with out the pilot hole in most cases .	1
This is a great drill and driver set . The battery is always ready with power to spare . I can leave it for a month and go to use it and the battery performs .	1
I 've owned several cordless kits/tools over the last couple of decades . My needs have changed as I 've grown in projects , and my old cheap black and decker sets have long since been replaced by Dewalts . I 've had the Dewalt 18V kits for several years and I 've been very happy with them . They last through most small jobs with one charge . They are solid , beefy , and have plenty of power , but are also pretty heavy . I nearly converted over to the Li-ion packs , but the price always kept me from it . Then came the 12v max line , I thought they were perfect for nearly every small job and home use . They are light , solid , and have surprising power in a compact size . The charge they hold may not last the entire project , but the packs are so cheap you can buy a couple extra to finish up ( and not break your wallet ) .Well now we have the 20v Max line . To be honest , if I did n't need to buy some new 18v packs , I would n't have even considered getting these . But I did , and I 'm not disappointed . They all have the same solid , beefy Dewalt design , but now they are light and compact as well . They appear to be nearly as small/compact as the 12v max tools . And these tools hold a charge for much longer than their 12v cousins . ( Sorry , I have n't done a comparison test on how long they all last , 12 vs 18 vs 20 ) .The new Impact driver is equal to the 18v version but lighter . Function and size seem nearly the same , but the 20v is slightly smaller and a good bit lighter.The new compact drill is not as small as the 12v version , but is slightly smaller than the 18v compact . power/speed seem to be equal to the 18v and better than the 12v , as you would expect.Charging seems much faster ( about 30min or so , but do n't hold me to it as I did n't discharge the pack fully ) .Even the case is great , since I 'm always using the impact and drill they go with me everywhere and take the most abuse , the hard case is a welcome change , than the soft bags of before.In summary , I 'd recommend this set if you are new or moving up from the inexpensive ( and usually low quality ) brands . If you 're already heavy into the old 18v stuff , I would n't bother with a switch until you have to replace them . In all fairness , I have not had much experience with other brands kits ( some Milwaulkee , a Bosch , and a Makita ) I 'm sure they are all great sets , but I was already using Dewalt so I stuck with them .	1
Let me start by saying I 'm no professional . I like to dabble in furniture and DIY projects around the house . My last drill was the Makita combo kit that retailed for 199 . I really liked the drill but the battery did n't hold very long and in the end the chuck went bad . At least that is what I was told it was . It would just spin out after drilling 2 screws into anything . That was after less than 6 months of normal to easy use . I ended up going with Dewalt this time around due mostly because I 've heard such good things about their stuff holding up . I want something I do n't have to replace every year ! The first unit I got did have a noticeable wobble and I returned it for another one . This one had a slight one but nothing more than anything else I 've ever used . I notice quite a bit more power in the impact drill over the makita right from the start . It just feels more powerful.I also like the fact that it goes to 2000 rpm , which is what is stated on the kreg jig site as a recommendation for drills . So if you use a Kreg Jig make sure you get one that will work best.Battery charges just as fast as my Makita did , without the horrible sounds that the Makita made while charging . It really was like the xbox of chargers . I could n't stand being in the same room as it charged up . The Dewalt is quiet and I do n't even hear a sound.One thing I have noticed on both the Dewalts was a bit of a smell coming off when first using them . I guess this is normal for a new drill , or you can correct me if I 'm wrong ... It is n't overpowering or any smoke . Just a faint smell of burn off of dust or something like that.Overall I 'm loving the drill . This is one of the rare times when I suggest going to Blue or Orange to buy the drill . It is WAY cheaper right now that way . Kinda sad really but Amazon is n't selling the item so it is up to whoever is on the price . Ca n't really fault Amazon on that one . Just do n't give your hard earned money away when you can save 50 bucks . Great thing is if it does wobble you can return it right away and get another one locally without waiting for returns and shipments.I looked at all the drills in the price range and for my money I was happy to land with Dewalt this time around .	1
As a contractor , I can say I 've owned my share of power tools ; this set blows everything else I 've owned out of the water . Upgrading my 10 year old 18V Dewalt cordless drill to this was like an awakening . Why did I tote around that large , heavy , slow-charging drill all these years ? The compact size does NOT mean less power ; the smaller battery does NOT mean less battery life ; this is simply the `` new '' and `` improved '' drill we 've all been waiting for . I bought the set for the impact driver , but if you do n't need it , I would still highly recommend the drill .	1
I purchased this set for light-moderate home usage . So far I have been very pleased by the set.First , the case . There is ample space for the tools and some room left over for some bits as well . Do n't plan on fitting a box of drill bits ... but you can certainly store some loose bits and small tools . The case handle is nicely contoured for carrying and feels good to hold . This is just the beginning.The charger is pretty compact . It would be nice to have some information regarding the battery level or status ... as this charger just has the same old blinking light ... However , the battery charges quickly , so you will not have to wait long . In my experience , the charger did not get too warm either.I have used the drill far more than the impact driver so far , so I will focus my comments on the drill.This drill is light . Upgrading the 1.5mAh battery to a 3mAh size will surely add some weight , but really not much . Drill bits load and unload quickly , with a satisfying click in the chuck when loading bits . The exterior of the drill is all plastic construction with a rubber grip . Metal would be nice , but for a household user the lighter weight is more appreciated . That said , the construction is very solid . Both tools have a belt hook on the side , which should really be a standard feature on any drill . Because of the light weight , hanging this drill on your belt wo n't drag you down.My gripe with the drill is that the LED worklight ( located near the trigger ) is almost useless at close range . The light becomes shadowed very very quickly by the long snout of the drill . The impact driver , on the other hand , has three LEDs located all around the drill bit ... . which makes for full light coverage even at close range.Both tools have a lot of torque and plenty of power.At the current price of $ 199 ... this is a great set . I was happy with my purchase when this combo was at $ 240 , and I would highly recommend it .	1
The Dewalt tools I 've used over the past many years have always been great.And now Dewalt has improved their style of battery releaseon this 20 volt combo , and it 's awesome.The forward/reverse button is at thumbs reach , and the drill is more petite all-around.It 's pretty impressive that this set is much more powerful , and yet so much smaller and lighter.This 1 1/2 ah version is very easy , and conveient to use.It has a strong metel hook to hang from a belt , which would actually be useful in any number of ways.The bit slot is open ended , so it no longer limits the lenght of bit it 'll hold.When you press the trigger of the drill , one LED light shines on where your pointed , and goes off automatically 20 seconds after the trigger is released.The impact driver does the same & has three LED lights.The lithium ion battery charges much quicker then my old nickel , taking only 15 to 30 min . depending how low the battery is.This Combo kit comes in a nice , but rugged hard plastic case.That 's great for storage or travel.This petite combo was designed with reliable powerfor working in tight areas , without tiring your hand as quickly.Footnote : Dewalt makes a quick connect impact driver conversion keyless chuck , Dewalt DW0521 . This chuck fits inside the impact driver chuck so it will hold drill bits .	1
These are a great set . The battery lasts longer than expected every time . The impact is strong for only a quarter inch . Most times I do n't have to tighted things after its used . The light is handy .	1
i have had every cordless tool made and these dewalts are nice . they are very light to work with but definately pack a punch . both the impact and the drill have a lot of power . there was a special going on at the time with a free third battery and that was nice . i have used them for several months now and they are holding up well .	1
This is a great set to have IF you are going to get use out of both the Compact Drill AND the Impact Driver , otherwise it would be less expensive to just buy the one you will use . My husband loves it and is using it for work as well as in his workshop . I have used the drill for household projects , but it 's a bit heavy for me . I am more comfortable using a lighter drill.The DEWALT Combo Kit is a quality item that I would highly recommend because we have other DEWALT tools and have never had a problem with any of them , making them very dependable . It 's also nice to not have to worry about charging the battery before every use .	1
I received this toolset as part of the Amazon Vine program , and boy , has it already come in handy . We have an existing 18V Black and Decker drill and Dewalt drill , so this was a bit of an upgrade.We tore out the rotten part of the bottom deck from the last owners and discovered significant decay on one of the structure poles . Unfortunately , it was bolted into the concrete . I thought we were sunk - then this toolset arrived and we were able to reseat a fresh pole ! This little set worked great through the concrete . I used these tools about 6 hours over 4 days and did not run out of battery.I noticed some earlier reviewers complaining about wobble and travel . I did not have that problem with my set - so it might be that the quality control problem has been fixed ? The radio is ok - but it seems like an odd combo with this set . Most people already have existing radios . The one nice thing is that it does have a USB connection so you could charge something like a phone or a tablet ( or , if you are like me , review a how-to video again ! ) Overall , a great toolset that is relatively light , powerful , and currently a good value at $ 280 .	1
This DeWalt drill set is fantastic . It comes with both a hammer drill and a compact drill . Furthermore , the set comes with two 20-volt batteries and a charging unit . So far , I like everything about it . The two batteries are more than enough to keep you in action full time . It takes very little time to achieve a full charge . In my tests , it is less than 30 minutes to complete the charge . The batteries themselves run for 1.5 hours of general use . At that rate , you can keep switching the batteries out , and keep on going in your job . The drills are POWERFUL ! Even the compact drill , which is great for getting into tight spaces , gives a tremendous amount of torque and speed , making tough drilling tasks much easier . The hammer drill is also very good . I could have used this last year when I was driving some wood beams into a concrete foundation to support a small stairway . One negative - while the hammer drill is powerful , it does not come with a support grip for your other hand to achieve maximum pressure while applying the hammer drill to its task . Despite that issue , the set is fantastic . I highly recommend it for your toughest household jobs .	1
This 20VDC hammer drill is compact and easy to fit into tight places , but do n't let the small size fool you -- it 's a powerful tool . I was able to easily bore through a 2 & # 34 ; X 4 & # 34 ; wall stud , using a 1 & # 34 ; auger bit , without the bit even slowing down .	1
I have seen other reviews talking about issues with drill wobble but I have seen none of this . I 'm not sure if it 's an issue from a past production run that has now been corrected or what but that issue does not exist on mine . I am not a professional installed of anything . I am a home owner who likes to do a variety of home projects . Previously I had a DeWalt 14.4v drill which these replaced . The 14.4v I had was solid as a rock but these 20v max drill/drivers are actually better . Last longer , more comfortable in my hand , have led lights which are a huge plus . These are high quality tools as you would expect from DeWalt and it shows . I have dropped them a few times and it 's like they are bullet proof , not a scratch . Talk about power , these are super powerful and noticably more powerful than my buddies bosch and panasonic drills . I have yet to find anything they ca n't handle . I like the fact that they all use the same 20v battery too . Charging is pretty quick and they hold a charge for a long time . Love the belt hooks as it 's really convenient . Overall if you are in the market for a new drill I would highly recommend spending a little more and getting this kit . For the price you ca n't beat it .	1
Had them for a week now and used both . They are very powerful , light and quality constructed . I 've never owned an impact driver before this one and I believe I 've found a new best friend . Highly recommended .	1
POWER POWER POWER.The new lithium ion batteries are VERY light . Plus , the drill itself is light , making long projects far less fatiguing than with older drills . 2 batteries are included . 30-35 minutes for a full charge and the batteries last a long time . Nonstop drilling action if you need/want it.The super powerful drill really is amazing . The lighted tip was a brilliant addition . It really makes it nice when drilling in a dark space or even just a place without great light ; you can see exactly what you are drilling . The light is on a timer , so it lights for a while and then shuts itself off . The batteries are interchangeable and charge surprisingly rapidly . By the time one wears out , the other one is ready to go . But do n't get me wrong , the batteries LAST quite a while.I ca n't recommend this highly enough . After using it for a couple of projects , it is clear that the lithium battery with its added power but super light weight is a HUGE advancement . Dewalt has got this DOWN ! Yes yes yes for the professional or do-it-yourself guy . Light enough even a small woman would n't struggle with it ... not to insult anyone 's masculinity . Good price and obviously the work of Dewalt incorporating feedback from their customers .	1
Dewalt is a well-known name for tools so the positive performance was no surprise . I like my Dewalt power toots and these just add to the garage fun.What is different about this is that the carry case is basically a kit -- You get an impact driver ( 20v ) , you get a compact hammer drill ( 20 v ) AND it also houses a workplace radioYou charge them with the lithium charger for the battery.A lover of my MP3 , I was not actually sure how I 'd feel about the radio or if I would use it ( even though I found the tools in the kit very easy to use ( I recently helped someone I hired build on to a chicken coop . Team effort . ) but I was delightfully surprised at the clarity and I actually enjoyed the music and chatter while we worked . Not having to plug it in was an even greater bonus.Very lightweight but with loads of power , these were easy to use and I am a novice with these tools.Charging was a snap , it 's all in a nice case , and everything is easy to use , novice or pro .	1
Dewalt is a respected name in the power tool business . These are heavy duty tools with 20 volts . Dewalt advertises that compared to 18 volt tools these have 37 % longer runtime per charge and are 57 % faster.The first thing we noticed was the LED lights which illuminate your work surface , brilliant . The power tools can be used on any surface including masonry . My husband feels they fit his hand nicely and are comfortable to grip.My husband is thrilled to have these tools to use for small home repair tasks.The radio is nice , gets great reception here and is loud and high quality . He wants to also use it for patio and poolside use ! There is a USB port to charge your phone , really convenient for workers.We rate this 5 stars = Love It !	1
These tools feel solid . I have used them for a few days now on a few small things and I have felt I had enough power to keep on going . I fixed a fence that has been giving me issues for several years . My old drill just didnt get the speed going to sink the screws into the wood and it always left the nails hanging a little out . This thing took all of 30 seconds to fix something I couldnt in two years . The radio is pretty nice , solid feeling as well and it has several outs on it where you can charge things . You can play the radio with it and you can also use it for an auxiliary and use it for whatever you want . I havent gotten a chance to properly use the impact wrench yet but can say it is insane when it is turned on and feels awesome in your hand . I will test it out this week on something and continue my review . All in all I can say these are some of the nicest tools I have used in a long time .	1
DeWalt is the cream of the crop , and everyone already knows that , so if you 've made it to this page , chances are you already know this is what you 're looking for . The tools are amazing quality . Only thing I can really add is that the radio is better than I expected . Not only can you connect an iPod , but you can also charge it . I do wish this kit had included another battery , but it 's a pretty good deal as-is , so I ca n't knock it a star for that . Overall , highly recommended to anyone that needs a hammer drill and impact driver ! !	1
Great set of power drills . Compact and powerful . Fits in hand and comfortable . Awesome set . Can not think of anything bad about it .	1
I love the lithium tools compared to previous Ni-Cad tools . The lithium batteries hold a charge and are ready to go when you need them . Ni-Cads always seem to be dead and they take a memory and fail much sooner than I 've experienced with Lithium batteries . This set includes the smallest batteries Dewalt makes for the 20V Max line , but higher capacity batteries are readily available . The drill and impact driver run very smoothly , and have a precision feel . I love the radio . It has some great features like a USB port and audio line in ability so you can stream or play songs from an MP3 player . It ran 10 hours or so on one battery charge , but it can also be plugged in . I do n't see the radio in other sets sold by other vendors , so I considered it a nice bonus with this set . The bag is also a convenient way to transport the tools to where the job is . I found the batteries charge very quickly , and the manual says they wo n't take a memory and can be charged at any time without degrading performance . Also , batteries can be left on the charger without risk of over-charging according to the manual . That is a nice feature if you forget to remove a battery .	1
`` DEWALT DCK285C2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion Compact 1.5 Ah Hammer Drill and Impact Combo Kit '' This is the best combo kit ever made . Both drill and driver are extremely powerful and lightweight . Batteries last a long time and also charge very quickly .	1
I 've owned and used a few brands of drills before but Dewalt always has a reputation for toughness above the rest . I actually wanted the full size version but got this one instead . The drill does wobble as mentioned by other reviewers , but it has yet to cause a problem so I do n't think it really concerns me all that much . The compact size is actually pretty nice to get into those tight places and the batteries have yet to die on me while working on jobs around the house.This combo is 3x as much as a Craftsman 19.2 , or other brands I am sure but it comes with a warranty that is 3x longer as well ; and it really has the ergonomics and solid build construction that I am hoping and almost doubting that I will ever have to use said warranty .	1
I got this Drill set for my husband , while I have not used it myself , he has said he really likes it ( I have since used the drill for a garden project and had no problem using it , it 's not just for men even though it 's best to let them think so ! ) Technical Details* DCD785 20V MAX 1/2-inch hammer drill features two speed transmission ( 0-600 / 0-2,000 ) * Heavy-duty 1/2-inch metal ratcheting chuck provides superior bit gripping strength* DCF885 Impact Driver has a compact ( 5.55-inch front to back ) , lightweight ( 2.8-pounds ) design fits into tight areas* Three ( 3 ) LED lights with 20 second delay after trigger release , provide visibility without shadows* Powered by and Energy Star qualified charger for a better environmentMy husband says : The drill is light-weight , cordless , has a lot of power , compact , and the chuck is easy to use . The drill set also has a clip so you can attach it to your belt . The drill also takes a charge well . I have also held this drill and it is quite comfortable , something that I believe would be quite easy and comfortable for a woman to use.The impact driver works well also , it is also light-weight , easy to use and has a lot of power.This drill is great for the average home-owner and the battery lasts for quite a long time which is a big plus . Not sure if this is normal or a defect but the drill makes a strange sound while on the second speed , this is why I am giving it a 4 star instead of a 5 star ... it is a type of a ratcheting sound which my husband has not encountered before with any of his drills.I received this drill set in exchange for review from the Amazon Vine program .	1
This is a very nice tool kit . I think this would be a perfect gift for a housing warming present or a gift for a new homeowner . Maybe even a gift for yourself if the occasion is right . Both the hammer drill and the impact drill have proven themselves to me to be very useful around the house . My old drill is a Milwaukee drill that has a cord . I love the power that my old drill gave me , but man is it nice to not have to run electrical cords everywhere when I have a small job to do around the house . This Dewalt drill that runs on 20v does not feel as powerful as my Milwaukee , but I really have not missed that additional power . I also am very impressed with the battery life of the 20v . These drills can really go along time on one charge.Also this is a small that but has brought me a lot of pleasure recently , is just how nice the radio is . The speakers seem to have a good sound to them . The interface is digital . I really enjoy having this little radio ! I like how the radio can also either be plugged in , or it can run off the same 20v . Another reviewer complained about if only she could have one more battery . I understand exactly what she was talking about as it would be nice to have all three of these hooked up and ready to go . As of now , I keep one battery on the hammer drill , I use it a lot more , and one battery plugged in . The other radio is plugged into the outlet in the shed.Because I am a novice DIY I can not speak to the wobble as other reviewers mentioned within their posts . I have not had any problems with the drill so far and have found it to be an enjoyable tool in the face of any challenge .	1
Both the drill and the impact driver pack a lot of punch and power in comparison to my 18V Dewalt drill . Multiple speeds , impact , you name it . After a couple of days of ownership , I & # 8217 ; m not sure what else I can do to really test this unit : - Repetitive drilling and screws replacing a portion of a wooden fence ? Check- Drilling through concrete ? Check- Drilling through masonry ? CheckI only drilled through the concrete just to see if it could do it & # 8230 ; .now I & # 8217 ; m inspired to tackle a couple of new projects because I now have tolls with the right & # 8220 ; oomph & # 8221 ; to get it done.The battery packs ( the kit comes with two 20V batteries ) hold a heck of a lot of power & # 8211 ; I & # 8217 ; m not sure how long they would really last as after four hours of steady use each day there was still a lot of power left in the frills ; I put them back on the charger at the end of the day as I wanted a full load when I started again the next day.The radio has okay reception and sound & # 8211 ; you can also plug it into a wall instead of just relying on batteries . One convenience to the radio is you can also power your phone via the USB charger on the side of the radio.Considering you get the two drills and the radio , a charger and two 20V battery packs which if you purchased them individually would cost you a little over $ 625 , this is a pretty good deal at $ 339 for the combo . If you are a do-it-yourself & # 8217 ; er or a contractor that travels around , I would recommend thi skit .	1
I acquired this drill for me -- myself -- a woman . I 've purchased a drill in the past but it was a run-of-the-mill device with no bells and whistles , I do n't even know the brand . It 's so interesting how a shiny new piece of equipment makes you want to walk around the house finding things to do ! I appreciate the fact that it 's so light . My first project was to purchase a special bit for glass and drill holes at the bottom of some beautiful ceramic vases ( for drainage ) . It worked like a dream . I do n't know that I 'll use the radio much because where I live the music choices are either 'country ' or 'western ' , but I imagine it 's just fine for most . I think this is the last drill I 'll ever have .	1
This is the perfect drill and driver combo for small and medium jobs . The price was better than the big box stores .	1
This set comes in a quality , durable bag as well as with two batteries . The batteries seemed to charge in under 30 minutes which is amazing . Putting the batteries in the charge and in the devices felt intuitive and simple . Performance of the drill and the driver were above expectation although I am still testing . I also want to test for the wobbling problem that others have reported . I also want to see how long the battery lasts . Also , I loved the LED light ( s ) on the drill/driver that automatically turn on/off.Radio is rugged in all aspects . I 'm very happy that it includes USB and AUX for those with portable MP3 players or smart phones . There is even a clever compartment on the side where you can store your portable music player . The last thing you need is your MP3 player loosely sitting around at a job site . Volume and audio clarity seemed good for the size of it.Only real complain I have thus far is the horrible industrial odor that these guys emit when you first run them . I 'm hoping the smell dissipates over time .	1
I bought this set from the warehouse deals section of amazon for a substantially lower price . I highly recommend warehouse deals and use it all the time . You can save some serious dough that way . Item was brand new and absolutely perfect in every way . Upon opening and messing with them , I immediately removed the belt clips from them , as I do n't use them and feel they get in the way , your opinion may differ , just a personal preference . The first thing that you will marvel at is just how lightweight these really are . I really bought these on a whim , but had been wanting them for a while . I already own a handful of 18v Dewalt tools with the xrp battery system , which I know I love and use a bunch . I knew I wanted to transition to the lithium ion system but did n't want to retrofit my 18v nicads with li ion batteries with a substantial cost.I also know that I love li ion batteries having already owned Milwaukee 's m12 system and could n't be happier . Those batteries make these tools a complete force to be reckoned . These new tools are now the closest things to being like their corded brethren . You get the amazing power , rpms and torque of corded , with these amazing batteries that are like having a cord because they last all day . I 'm sure that the fatter batteries are even better but only heavier . These will last all day for whatever you are doing and if you do need to recharge , it only takes 30 minutes to charge from dead . The charger also will charge Dewalt 's 12v li ion batteries as well , which I do not have.The hammerdrill will absolutely twist your wrist depending on your bit , which means it has amazing power and torque . But by far the impact driver is my absolute favorite by far . I use it 90 % of the time without hesitation . It 's weight is n't much more than my m12 impact driver which is great . This 20v system is absolutely great and now they are finally offering bare tools as well , also a plus . This is my third impact driver having already the m12 impact , and a dewalt 18v impact . I would not trade these tools for anything and you would have to pry them from my hands . Nothing but good things to say . The only thing that irritates me is that these batteries nor tools have a battery gauge . Maybe I 'm just spoiled by the m12 but that is something I wish these had . Do yourself a favor and try to pick one of these up in warehouse deals . I give my complete recommendation . Thanks for reading , and please vote as to the helpfulness of this review , Ray .	1
First I would like to mention that I ordered these for domestic use . So this review comes from a guy who needed the tools to the occasional work at home . For my needs , I have to say this set is just what I needed . For years I had been borrowing my father in law 's hammer drill and always liked the fact that it ran on batteries and was cordless , so when I saw this DEWALT I did not hesitate to get it.Upon receiving it , the box was quite larger than I expected , out of the box , the hammer drill and the driver come in heir own carrying bag , the bag was quite light considering it contained both tools and the required charger and batteries . The radio comes in a separate box , opposite to the tools , it is quite heavy , it looks well built , sturdy and I have no doubts the thing is resistant to heavy use . The radio also surprised me because the one thing I was not expecting is that it actually includes USB and AUX inputs , so say you are in the mood of listening to something on your mp3 player on phone , you can actually do that . Not only that , but there is a small compartment built in where you can actually keep your iPod safe inside so you can carry the radio around ( a small AUX cable is included ) . The radio can be plugged to an electrical outlet and it also runs on the same batteries used by the hammer drill and driver ( the batteries are shared actually ) I had some pending work at home ( some shelves and souvenirs that needed to be hung on walls ) so I took that as an opportunity to test the new tools . I was amazed by the hammer drills ' performance after drilling on concrete on several occasions , this is indeed a powerful tool.For my needs , I can honestly say I got more than I expected . I can not see myself not recommending these , they are powerful-quality tools and the price of the set beats the price of getting them separately . Recommended .	1
This might be the best Father 's Day gift to myself ever . I am not the world 's greatest do-it-yourselfer , mainly because I have never tried or had the right tools . I needed this DeWalt tool set to get me motivated . Both tools have a lot of heft and feel solid in my hands . I used the driver tool to change a number of outdoor lights and it had way more power than I needed for this simple job . Then I used it to assemble a log bed frame . It was much better suited for that heavier job . The radio sounds surprisingly clear and has a good tone . I will be able to use the radio at the pool this summer . I could n't be happier with this tool set . I plan on getting a lot of work around the house accomplished now that I have such great tools . Highly recommended .	1
This is a great drill set . It comes with a hammer drill , an impact driver , and 2 batteries . The drills and batteries are light but powerful.The batteries where charged within an hour or so , and they last well over an hour each.Both the hammer drill an impact driver are comfortable to hold and deliver a lot of power.My favorite feature is the lights . It makes it really easy to see exactly where you are placing the tip . This is great because I am often casting shadows on to the areas I am working . The lights do n't waste power because they come on when you need them and then shut off on their own.I really find the drills surprisingly powerful . You just do n't get that picture in your head when you think of something battery operated.I highly recommend this set for home projects as well as the professional builder .	1
These tools are great . The drill is powerful enough to burn out 6 & # 34 ; wall penetrations but also had a hammer feature for concrete or masonry . The impact driver is my go to . Whether I am hanging stuff on the wall or trying to loosen a large nut on a shaft , it is absolutely a perfect tool . Do yourself a favor and get the adapters to use this thing on sockets , it will change your life .	1
After my 12 volt Black & Decker drill began running out of juice , I decided I needed a new toy ... ummm , I meant `` productivity enhancing equipment '' ( if my wife is reading this ) to help me get through my projects . Because my main reason for purchasing was power running out in the middle of a project , I decided I wanted all the juice I could get , so I opted for the 3.0 Ah battery instead of the of the 1.5 Ah . Sure it adds a LITTLE size and weight , but I think its worth it to have the extra juice . Decided to try the combo , and its nice to not have to keep changing from drill bit to driver bit . Lights at the front are a great bonus as well . Neighbor also decided to buy one when he saw mine .	1
I 've worked in construction and Hollywood film production for the last twenty years . I 've used and abused every brand of power tool there is . If you want the best cordless tools currently available on Earth , buy this DeWalt 20v kit.These are not tools for the weak , timid , or poor . These are powerful , top-dollar , high-quality professional pieces . If you have any doubt about your need for these tools or your ability to handle them , then please buy something lesser , which is to say , most anything else.You can hurt yourself in a hurry with these tools . The torque from either drill or impact is substantial ; when you hit the trigger , the tool jumps , hard . When you let off the trigger , it stops _right now_ and bucks again . You smell ozone and see sparks . This is good . This is power.These are the first cordless tools I 've ever owned that have not left me wishing for more power . Actually , I 've had to learn respect for these little monsters . The word `` weak '' will never enter your mind when these are around , and you can easily break things and cause all sorts of damage if you 're not careful ; snap bolts , drive screws right through your workpiece ... Much like a powerful car , these reward skill and punish error . You could probably break your wrist with the drill and a big wood bit , if you tried . But I like power and I do n't mind danger . If you feel differently , maybe get something tamer.The chucks are great . The drill 's keyless chuck is strong , positive , industrial , precise . I like how the shaft locks up so you can change bits without hitting the trigger , if you want.The impact driver chuck is excellent , requiring no fiddling to insert , and never jamming up on release like some other impacts I 've dealt with . I guess DeWalt has a new impact with a different pushbutton chuckless setup ; might check that out someday , but this one rocks for now.The battery life is so good , it 's unbelievable . The charger is very quick and has a large LED to let you know what 's up . Speaking of LED 's , the impact has three and the drill has one , all very bright and helpful.I guess some guys do n't like the bag . I 'm happier with a bag than a hard case any day , but that 's personal preference . Anyway , the bag looks built to last and holds the two guns , batteries , and charger comfortably with room for a bit more.The only drawback to these tools is price . They are more expensive than some others , but you get what you pay for in this case at least . For me , the awesome performance plus the anticipated longevity make these tools a great value . Plus , when you show up at a job everyone will be envious and asking to fondle or borrow them . Fondle yes , borrow , no ! I do n't know how they did it , but the box showed up almost before I got done ordering it . Beyond fast shipping.Highly and unconditionally recommended .	1
Now this is the best of all Dewalt cordless drills . Tough bag this set is a work horse.Easier to drill and put screws in all forms . No need for me to carry extension cords to other sights just for installing 2-4 lights . This tool is a must for you home enthusiats involved in do it yourself projects . Also electricians , carpenters , masons , mechanics , joiners and more . Purchase now to get your job done faster than you ever imagined . If you do n't then you miss out .	1
I realize there are cheaper sets , also by DeWalt , but I 'm quite happy with this one . Plenty of power , very nice design , good balance . I especially like the lights . A few quibbles : no clutch adjustment on the driver . And the head on the drill is a little large for use in tight spaces . But they fit my hands and I 'm happy to use them every time .	1
My husband is a remodeling contractor and often an excellent test of how 'sturdy ' a product is . He uses these tools daily , six days a week . The conclusion : DeWalt tools are DURABLE and an absolute must in the contracting field . The cordless , rechargeable battery gives you more options out in the field where the electric may not be hooked up yet . When charged in the morning , the tools last him all day while on the job . The hammerdrill was excellent for going through concrete . There is also a lot to be said for the compact , lightweight size . When you have a truck full of tools and often very little space , you appreciate the ease of these smaller sized drills that do a big job . The lighter weight and easy to carry bag also made it easy for me to bring the tools into the house if I needed them for a lighter job , such as putting in a screw for a picture frame or putting up curtain rods . The perfect gift for the guy or gal who have very little space and need tough tools that can help with numerous projects around the house . I also highly recommend it for college students who find they need to install beds , shelves , bookcases , etc . in their dorm rooms when they first move in . They 're easy to use and not heavy , making them perfect for a younger guy or gal who may not have much experience with drills . The batteries charge quickly and easily , as well as taking up very little storage space .	1
Before buying this kit I was in doubt about buying both a hammerdrill/driver and an impact driver . But I searched the web to fully understand the difference between the two of them.It turns out that an impact driver is way lighter than the hammerdrill and the torque is way stronger.The 20V batteries last longer than regular 12V batteries and these tools are much more powerfull than other cordless tools I 've tried.The work leds are really helpfull when drilling or fastening on dark , hard to reach places.I 'm a DIY beginner but I already used these tools and they perform great . I also work manufacturing large power supplies and the impact driver is very usefull to assemble all the parts of the power supply together.Pros : Long battery life , really shinny leds , extremely comfortable grip and power to perform almost any task . Fast charge of battery pack.Cons : The hammerdrill DCD985 is really heavy . It weights more without the battery pack than DCF885 with the battery pack.I 've just tried my new tools to fix the curtains of the living room . Despite being heavier than I expected , the DCD985 performs really well . I drilled 4 holes on masonry , using the hammerdrill at minimum rpm ( 0-500 ) . The holes were just perfect . You can see the difference between this drill and other regular power drills . I have a Black & Decker ; corded power hammerdrill but it 's almost impossible to use the hammerdrill at low rpm ratings . And of course , because of the high RPMs , the drill bit almost always slips a little from the original designed drilling markings . It just does n't happen with the DCD985 . You can be sure to start and to finish the drilling process at the very same spot ! ! Amazing ! ! As for the DCF885 , it performs really fine , with the exception of fastening screws on fragile working pieces . I just destroyed the curtain wooden holding hooks with this impact driver . Now I know that it was a job for a regular driver ( without impact aid ) . The impact driver is more suitable to fastening large bolts and performing heavy-duty kind of work .	1
I 've never treated myself to a power tool this expensive , but it worth every penny . It is a joy to use and a beautiful piece of craftsmanship in itself . Previously , whenever the going got tough - drilling into brick etc - I had to put my cordless drill aside an drag out an old 1/2 horsepower corded drill . No need any longer -- the DeWalt can handle anything . I have a whole workroom full of tools , including two other drills -- but if I had to choose between the DeWalt and everything else , I 'd take the DeWalt !	1
I bought this set because I was having problems finding 18V Li-Ion compact batteries locally.I like the power of the drills and the impact driver is the bomb ! ! ! ! I 'm still not too sure about the carry bag though ...	1
this is the big boy kit with the hammer drill and the bigger batteries . i bought this because my porter cable batteries were starting to suck . it takes a long time to get through one of these 3.0ah batteries..I love it . it 's real nice having two sets of impacts also . Both drills have nice lights , the impact is so nice and small and powerful with a belt clip ! you can just pop the 1/4 inch shank in without pulling the little circular thing out like on other impacts . the hammer drill is pretty large and heavy , but it 's a hammer drill and pretty powerful for being cordless	1
I can not believe I did not purchase this combo set MUCH earlier . After doing much research online , I determined that the dewalt 20v max set was right for me , and since it includes ( 2 ) 3.0ah batteries , the set could not be any more complete . I have had the opportunity to test out both drills and can not be pleased enough . The hammer drill has A LOT of power and is VERY compact in comparison to other Dewalt hammer drill models I 've owned in the past . Both drills have AWESOME weight distribution for a balanced feel . The led light on the hammer drill and the 3 led lights on the impact drill are a great extra when getting a better view at the area being worked in . The impact drill is very compact and packs quite a punch . Ive tested it out with wood screws , tap cons , long bits , short bits , etc . It does it all . The hammer drill has various settings that can be altered according to the type of task being put through . Overall , I AM VERY pleased with this set . Dewalt has n't failed me yet , so I 'll continue buying their products . Aside from the fact that the drills both work incredibly well , are compact , well balanced , and well designed , they are also aesthetically VERY nice looking and the matching contractors bag completes the set . I HIGHLY recommend this set . The $ 299 is worth EVERY PENNY .	1
In my opinion , the best combo . If you 're not familiar with DEWALT , you will not regret this purchase . Well made power tools , very solid build , feel great in your hand , not too heavy or too light , enough power for whatever you need . It will hurt when you drop them but they can take the abuse . The battery last almost forever , easy to tell when it 's charged since it has a button led display of the charge level . The duffle bag is nice and well made but I do n't use it other than storage ( I 'm organized ) .	1
This DeWalt 20v drill / impact driver kit is very high quality , is well made , and the 3.0 ah , 60w batteries last a long time . I often use my drill all day doing commercial HVAC work so the higher capacity batteries were a must , but the extra expense ( over the 1.5 ah ) may be wasted if you only use the tool occasionally . I also own a red M18 XC combo kit ( 47w ) and an orange 18v NiCd combo kit and the DeWalt is the only one with a three speed selector , and the batteries are easier to remove . The Li ion batteries are very expensive for this tool if purchased separately , so hopefully I can get at least two years out of them . I do not have long-term usage info yet but it seems like it 's a heavy duty drill.The tools are of equal or better quality than the others I have owned and used and it looks like the soft rubber parts of the drill housing are heavier and will hold up better than some of the other brands have . I also bought the LED flashlight for the 20v system and it 's nice and compact to fit in the bag . I really like the one hand chuck on the impact driver which makes it easy to change tools on the fly.Unfortunately you get a canvas bag instead of a hard case , but it 's decent quality . I put my sockets and hex chucks and bit tips in a small zipper bag that fits nicely in the tool bag with the drill and driver and charger . I recommend removing the batteries from the tools when in storage and transit .	1
I have had this for a few months now and its a huge improvement over my last drill / Driver which was a Dewalt 14.4 VUpdateBattery LifeThe battery life of this drill is huge . I have the 3 A hour battery and I hardly ever need to charge it . I just moved and I have done a lot of little project . So far since owning these I have charged each battery two times at most . This was not the case with my older 14.4 V drill . I would have had 10 or more charges at this point.Batteries also charge very quickly , feels like 30 minutes at most for a full charge.Old ReviewI have previously used and still own a Dewalt 14.4 volt drill and driver so I am aware of what the tools are capable of . I have had the 14.4 volt drill for 13+ years and it still works great , but the two batteries it came with are shot . The driver for 4 years also still works well and has good batteries . I decided on the upgrade because I wanted to give myself a Christmas gift , and a new battery was already $ 60.I went for the impact combo because based on reviews it seemed to have better features and I already had a non-impact drill . I also went with the 3.0A hours as it was not much extra money.The two features I want to talk about are weight and the wobbleWobbleIf you read reviews and watch videos of this drill there are a lot of complaints about bit wobble . Mine has no wobble at all , even on impact mode . If wobble is an issue it must be on an older or different model.Weight / size.This thing is super light . The batteries are much lighter and smaller then my 14.4 V. I originally got the 14.4 13 years ago because at the time 18V batteries were huge . Overall each tool is a little less in size and weight as the 14.4 weight models . I did not expect this.ConsThe only con so far is only the impact driver came with the belt clip . I did not even know that was part of the package when I bought it and I was like , `` wow this belt clip is super cool '' but then when it was not on the drill I was somewhat bummed . So its just a 1/2 bonus .	1
The order came as expected . The tools are built well . I charged the batteries and have been useing them for over a week and have not charged them since . I have alway been a fan of DeWalt tools and have used them for many years . I think this combo is one of the finest from DeWalt . Just wish extra batteries were not so expensive .	1
After mostly having simple B & D drills around the house for repairs this beautiful set came along as an eyeopener of sorts.First and foremost its awesome looking.Has reasonable weight.Not too heavy ..not too light.Rechargeable with 20V lithium ion batteries.Sports 3 LED lights which makes the need for headlamps etc a thing of the past.Easy torque adjustments.Well designed storage bag to keep everything and more in place.The hammer drill is what get much use in my house and its awesome how easy and fast it makes of what would otherwise be hard work.This is super powerful inspite of rechargeable batteries definitely a must for people into home repairs.Seemed like and overkill at first for home repairs to me but it makes perfect sense to have 1 solid peice of equipment for good than replacing the cheap ones every few years.Definitely a great set to own for anyone who owns a house .	1
I am an occasional fixer upper , so this is definitely more than what I need . But the best review is from two friends who have borrowed these drills and afterwards purchased at least one of them for their own use.Most homeowners at sometime purchased a power drill . For the casual person , like me , this is probably enough . But for those who do DIY projects on a regular basis , the little extra power will probably pay big dividends and make the projects go faster.Having two batteries is great because they are interchangable . So if one runs out you can use the other and charge the first .	1
I recently sold myDeWalt DCD780C2 20-Volt Max Li-Ion Compact 1.5 Ah Drill/Driver Kitand my hammer drill ... to upgrade ! It does n't make sense sometimes to buy tools separately when the kits are so much cheaper ! Factor in the cost of batteries , and well , you save enough to justify.Tools work as expected . Nothing unexpected . I was a little disappointed at not having a hard case , but this soft case is n't made like the cheap ones I 'm used to . It actually feels durable and looks to have enough space to hold the kit contents ( ca n't say that for every kit bag ) .What 's annoying though is that only one belt clip is included , and NO bit holders included like on the compact drill I sold ( part # N098881 ) . And these things are n't easy to find , so far , I have n't had any luck locating them for sale separately , and Dewalt customer support simply shrugged me off . ( On their website it says the bit holder has been substituted by the belt clip [ ... ] ) Obviously not a make or break thing , as hanging the hammer drill from my belt would likely depants me . But I still use the clips to hang the tools up or off to the side . Good tools , but come on ! You can find the clip here : DeWalt Belt Clip/Hook for 20V Max Drill/Hammerdrill/Driver DCD980 DCD985 DCD980L2 DCD985L2	1
I read the reviews and saw a few people say there was wobble in the drill . Bought one end of 2013 for Christmas and either they have changed the chuck or I got one that does n't wobble - either way was willing to risk the wobble due to Amazon 's excellent return policy which in this case I did not need to use ! I 've used both the drill and driver for quite a few home hobby projects over the last few weeks and am loving the inbuilt light feature . My trusty 'orange ' 12v drill has n't had any use lately and looks like it is destined for being given away.The 20v power these drills provides means I have n't had to bust out my corded drill lately , so may be saying good bye to that as well ! All in all , best drill purchase I have ever made in my entire life . Highly recommended .	1
The impact driver is a gem . Used my brothers and had to have it . The drill is very handy as well and a clear upgrade from my old 9 volt Makita system ( which served me well for years and years ) . I would give 5 stars if it had a hard case like DeWalt use to do for these power hand tools . The soft case is worthless for these tools as they can not be organized and stored securely . On the other hand , if you need a little satchel for something else , I guess it works for that .	1
My wife surprised me with this for me as a gift , I had grown awful tired of having to charge my Ryobi before I used it and having had an XRP that grew legs , I had nudged that I wanted the new 20v max set . This is the first impact driver that I have ever had and only the 2nd I 've used , my father in law has a new Milwaukee , but the DCF885 is an animal . I used it for tearing apart my snow blower and it broke free every bolt I put it on . It 's really nice to actully drive 3 & # 34 ; screws without striping the heads out . The battery life is great , I mean , I 'm not a full time contractor , but I used it nearly every day for a week when I got it with out charging . The drill in this set is the DCD985 , I probably wo n't be need the hammer function for a while , but the drill performs very well . Plenty of power for 1 & # 34 ; spade bits , enough finesse to use as a screwdriver putting furniture together etc . Again , great batter life , awesome chuck . The only three complaints with this set are the bag could be a little bit bigger , the chuck on the impact has a minor wobble with longer drill bits , and the drill seems to throw sparks the first few times I use it but now that it broke in its fine . All around a good set , I 'm very happy with it , I bought the flash light to go with it and I 'm going to buy the circular saw as well . Dewalt did a great job with these new tools and this set will last me a long time	1
purchased to replace same set in 18v xr , lithium ion batteries proved superior in staying power . still will keep 18v asbackup or for helpers on the construction sight .	1
For my kids birthday we bought a swingset/clubhouse that required HOURS of assembly . My step father brought his DEWALT and everyone who helped put the set together wants one now . My personal drill used up both batteries in the first hour and it takes all night to charge . This DEWALT literally takes 30 minutes to charge . That alone is worth it ! On top of that the drills are very powerful . So much so that you have to be careful . When switching from my weak lame drill to this one I 'd forget the power behind it and pull the trigger hard . If your in a tight area with your knuckles close to something the whiplash will get you . We were amazed at the strength and speed of the units.I really liked the feel of the hammer drill . It is very small but packs a punch . I 've never used a hammer drill before so I was surprised at how well it get tight bolts in.Throughout the whole process my dad , my brother in law , and myself kept saying man I want one of these . So now I 'm price checking !	1
I was very surprised and happy to have bought these drills for the price it was offered . It would 've been 6 out of 5 stars ( I know it 's not possible ) if the case was hard , and not soft.I found these to be of better overall feel in your hand than the Milwaukee counter parts -- but I still think Milwaukee tools look better , and the easier battery change . : PThere is more than enough torque and power for any job I 've had to do so far . But I almost feel like having 3 speed settings with the 20+ clutch positions is almost overkill . I usually stick with the 2nd or 3rd gear and if i need it to drill slower , I just squeeze less on the trigger . That 's just my opinion.Definitely recommended . If you are looking at the combos with impact and just drill and not hammer drill , do n't . Pay the extra few bucks for the hammer option . It 's such a devastating feeling when you need to drill through masonry and you ca n't , but you try anyways and dull out your drill bits . : (	1
I have n't really used the impact driver much yet , but I 'm loving the hammer drill . The battery lasts a long time and it does the job well . I 'm not going to remove a star for the case because that is n't the product being sold here , besides that , I am using one one of the tough system cases for my drill .	1
I rated this 5 stars because these two tools are BEASTS ! The kit comes with a Hammer Drill and a Reciprocating Saw . Both of these tools work great ! I 've had many DeWalt tools over the years and these live up to the same expectations of all the others . This particular kit comes with 2 3.0 Ah batteries that last a really long time . The bag for the tools is great and big enough to add the other DeWalt tools I purchased separately .	1
Note : I believe that only two piece combo kits for the 20V version come with the 'retail ' version of the saw . The rec saw included in the 5 piece kit has a different model number than the one they sell by itself . The two piece kits have the same model as the one you buy by itself . There 's a difference . I 'm not going through that in my review as you can just as well Google it since now you know it 's there.Rec . Saw : I 've used this on several projects . It works as advertised . The battery has lasted me much longer than the 18V dewalt . But that could be due to age of the batteries . I like the quick release on the side and i like the fact that i can put a blade in facing any way i need it . The saw feels solid in hands and the grips keep it there.Hammer Drill : I 've used this for plenty of drilling and driving . It surely has the power and the detachable metal handle comes in handy in some situation . However , as a hammer drill it is just ok . I was able to drill through brick rather easily . However , when i needed to drill through cinder-blocks it took a lot more effort on my part than i liked . It does it 's job just fine - but keep in mind that this DOES NOT replace an SDS drill . Not a downfall of this drill - so i 'm not taking a star off . This drill was designed to do some hammer drilling ( and it does , better through some materials than others ) . If your primary use is drilling into cinder blocks though - i 'd consider a supplement they 're not that expensive . Check reviews on Amazon , I 'm sure you 'll find one you like.Overall i 'm satisfied with this tool combo . Since this purchase , i also bought the Dewalt 20v jigsaw and flashlight to complement the set.The charger is nice and quick , but somehow feels a little cheaper than the previous Dewalt chargers.The new battery connector - not too crazy about it . But it seems a lot of other people like it just fine . I thin the idea is good , but the connector is not refined enough .	1
I 'm a single woman who has to take care of a house by herself , so I need a drill with power . I also occasionally build small things , living on a mini-farm.I love the slimmer handle grip on this DeWalt drill..My last drill was a Makita and I 'm a petite woman and my hand had to stretch too much to reach around the grip ... This drill 's grip is much slimmer and I 'm so very happy about that . The weight is good and balanced , although it 's a pound more than my Makita.The BEST part is how the battery attaches to the drill ! ! I struggled so much getting my Makita battery on and off because my hands are so small , but this one you just click it on and then simply push a button to remove it..I ca n't tell you how much better that is for me . Thank you DeWalt ! The instructions are clear and are accordion style . However I did not understand the charger symbols..Simply the light blinks when it 's charging and solid when it 's fully charged . The rest of the buttons on the drill are simple and easy to understand . Even with the confusing instructions about the symbols , charging is simple and it takes about one hour to charge one battery.The box includes a very durable tote bag with extra side pockets on the outside and inside . No compartments inside to separate the drill by itself though..but at least I can keep drill , charging units and battery all in one place.The saw was a bonus for me..because I have a jigsaw I mainly use for most everything , but I may learn to use it now that I have one.For anyone who does n't know ... a Hammerdrill is used to drill into concrete , bricks etc . It hammers as it drills to be able to do this . I think that option will offer up a lot more ways to use this drill , being able to drill into bricks and through concrete .	1
Super sweet drill sawzaw combo , the only thing is when really really using the sawzaw it seems to fall on it 's face and slow down here and there , i am not sure if it is a overheat circuit in the motor protecting it or what	1
The drill was great but kept slipping when I tried to use it to put in screws . Would not hold and drive them in all the way . I know this is not the normal for this drill since I also have another that does great . Too bad since I wanted this with the reciprocal saw match .	1
If you are a new homeowner , this is the drill to get . I have used it to drill through wood , plastic , steel ductwork , and brick , having no problems . Just make sure that you use the correct bit for the job.I decided to get the kit with the reciprocating saw , as it was not much more expensive than the drill alone.If you are comparing the kit to other dewalt kits , pay extra attention to the reciprocating saw . There are two different saws in the 20V Max line , and this is the nicer of the two . The other saw does not have the 4-position blade clamp or the adjustable shoe.The bag is a tough bag , but does not securley hold the tools . They just lay loose . I would expect to at least have a couple of straps , or dedicated pockets . Not too big of a deal , as the tools are the real meat of this kit , but I would expect a little better in a $ 400 kit .	1
Lately myDEWALT DC988KA 18-Volt Cordless Hammerdrill/Drill/Driver Kithas been dying and not holding a charge for more than 30 minutes with minimal effort drilling . Then the quest began in search of a new one . So many choices , so many choices . First I thought to myself , why not just buy new batteries ? Well again so many options , Ni-Cad vs Li-Ion what was the difference besides price vs function . TheDeWalt DC9180-2-C ( 2 ) 18V NANO Lithium-Ion Batteries w/ DC9310 7.2V - 18V Ni-Cd / Ni-MH / NANO Lithium-Ion 1-Hour Battery ChargerAlmost $ 200 for 2 batteries and a charger equates to around $ 100.00 a battery in almost any big box store , NOT ON MY WATCH ! . But why compromise when you can have both , so I went with the newDEWALT DCK292L2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 3.0 Ah Hammer Drill and Reciprocating Saw Combo Kitand a freeDEWALT DCB200 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 3.0 Ah Battery Packwith an additional $ 25.00 off . For $ 300.00 I received 3 new 3.0 Ah batteries with a new premium hammerdrill and the good quality sawzaw as free bonus 's . Do n't be fooled into getting theDEWALT DCK490L2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 3.0 Ah 4-Tool Combo KitorDEWALT DCK590L2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 3.0 Ah 5-Tool Combo Kitand think you are getting a quality sawzaw or circular saw . Look at the DEWALT website and compare the numbers on the saws they are cheaper and do not have as many options . I also orderdDEWALT DCB201-2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 1.5 Ah Compact Battery 2-Packfor $ 100.00 with $ 25.00 off and PRIME two day shipping . All in total 5 batteries two premium tools for $ 375.00 and a charger .

Like the grinder , jigsaw , and a few others . This is the time to start purchasing as they are pushing th elower prices to launch the new 20v line . Also this is actualy 18v it jsut distinguishes a slide on battery vs the old goos neck type . It is all a marketing scheme btu it works !	1
It 's taken me a little while to test out all the tools . Overall , I 'm very happy with the set , and think it 's a reasonable price . For more money , you can get more powerful tools , but these are great for someone like me , who does relatively regular home projects , but not major repair.What I liked about the 1/4 impact driver : Super compact and fits into small spaces like a joist or cabinet . I sometimes get tired of holding my heavy driver when I 'm working with my arms above my head ; this was much lighter and easier to maneuver . I was impressed with the amount of torque . I 'd give it 4 stars , as it only seems to hold 1 '' bits . Sometimes I need a different size , but I do have my other driver.The reciprocating saw is small enough that I was finally able to make a ceiling joist cut to fix a door opening problem . ( I installed a screen door on the outside ; the joist for the ceiling overhang is in the way ) . As the battery wore down , though , the cuts were n't quite as smooth . 3.5 stars.The LED is very bright and long-lasting . I can use it camping and also when the power goes out ; it 's nice to have something with a rechargable battery , as it 's likely to be charged and ready-to-go . I did not test the entire length it operated , but did have it on constantly for 6 hours with no noticable dimming . It 's very easy to adjust and position ; in addition , it has a little metal clip to hang for hands-free ( although the base is stable enough that it can also stand on a level surface ) . 4.5 stars.The bag is just a regular , standard bag . It 's not of much use if you have an existing bag or regular toolbelt . 3 stars.All of the batteries were fully charged within an hour of their first use ; afterwards , it seems like they are usually fully charged between 30 - 45 minutes .	1
The reciprocating saw does not have the 4 side positioning blade like the other version only up and down . Other than that it is a great set . Flash light is strong and has a good focus beam of light that goes far enough .	1
Pretty much have one of each of the 20v Max tools . Long battery life , great durability . Mine get dropped a lot ... .Just one of those tools that I try to balance on the top of a ladder all too often . Loved my 18V system for many years and then switched to these once they went mainstream ... .. Do n't miss those 18v at all . These weight less and put out more ... plus last longer .	1
I have used the set for several weeks now . It has met all of my expectation . The drill in particular is fantastic , the same heavy duty I have used in the NiCad version . This combo kit is a great deal .	1
These high quality battery-run tools compare in weight and power to 120 volt tools ... .I took a used swing set apart using the impact driver to break loose several rusted bolts and the the saws to cut bolts that would n't budge ... the batteries charge fast and are very light compared to older 12 or 14 volt batteries . The storage bag is a heavy grade fabric is large enough to hold the tools and charger nicely .	1
One of my great annoyances with rechargeable products has been battery life . Charge it up hoping to have it ready for use at any time and inevitably by the time you actually need it , the battery is dead and you wind up waiting hours for it to charge . The only solution is to constantly monitor the battery and charge as often as needed regardless of use . So Dewalt gets big points here for using Li-Ion batteries , as they will take a charge and simply hold it . How long , I do n't know , but from my experience it 's months and months and months ... Included here is a well-balanced , hefty hammer drill ( which functions as a regular drill just fine ) that I used the most , a reciprocating saw , impact driver , and a pistol-grip LED light , all packed in a larger , tough bag . The only questionable item among them is the light - I have n't really felt a need to use it , though I suppose it 's probably a nice light , bright and long-lasting . It just seems like a toss-in to say `` 4 tool kit '' rather than `` 3 tool kit . '' The hammer drill has been put to use many times around the house for various duties - metal , wood , light and heavy - and not once did I doubt its abilities . This is the first cordless drill that has instilled any confidence in me about its ability to get a job done . Most consumer level drills ( read : cheap ) are really pretty weak , but the Dewalt is , of course , not a consumer-level drill.The reciprocating saw may be meant for cutting joists and plywood , but I actually employed it to hack off some offending thick tree branches that I otherwise would have been out there using a hand-saw on . And it worked beautifully - it made fast work of this apparently menial job . It 's probably overkill , but it 's the tool I had and I 'm thrilled I did n't have to wear out my arm instead with the old hand-saw.You get what you pay for . I know many will balk at the price of this set , but having bought and subsequently replaced at least three low-end drills in the past few years , it 's worth it to invest in a better tool up front . Not only will it last longer , it will do the job better . You may not need all of the tools in this set , but you can buy them separately at more reasonable prices ( though I believe the set is cheaper together - if you have a need for all three tools ... and light . )	1
True to the Dewalt brand name , this is a combo set that provides a sturdy set of tools that should be sufficient for most homeowners for repairs and small projects ( I have used the set to install screen doors , step railings , and patch some water leakage issues on ceiling ) . One can easily sense the sturdiness of the tools when you hold them the very first time , the battery seems to be heavier than another common brand driver/drill set I own , but not to a point it can be bothersome . The batteries recharge very quickly ( 45 min to less than an hour ) and hold charge quite well , ( though that is dependent on your usage ) .The real issue is the pricepoint - one may be able to find cheaper combos from the same brand if you can do without a brand name work light and the bag etc . Someone wanting to build a collection maybe better off assembling a portolio of tools as needs emerge - though the total price for that approach may be higher . It will provide the flexibility of mix-and-match for various brands , however . For the current listed price ( and rarely goes on sale ) , it is likely to be a tad too expensive for the average homeowner - but for someone who needs a tool set for regular use the sturdiness of the tools and the brand name will be an obvious appeal .	1
I 'm waiting for the replacement set to arrive . I was able to try out the originals with one battery left in kit upon arrival and found the power great for cordless tools . I would recommend they ship these in an unmarked box though . I 've had this problem before with Dewalt tools . Years ago I ordered a set and they came up missing at the terminal and the tracking just dropped out of existence . That yellow and black box is a dead give-away for anyone who wants great tools . This will be my umteenth set of Dewalt cordless tools and these are as good as the ones from the past . Being a former tradesman ( prior to retiring ) I used just about every brand available . And I kept coming back to Dewalt due to the durability and precision . After I retired I bought a set of Black and Decker tools and added to it over time to get a very large collection of their 18 volt tools . Their tools are great but the batteries did n't hold up long , even brand new ones went bad in months . Black & Decker used to make Dewalt tools . Not sure how that worked out after B & D went belly-up and purchased by Stanley Tools a couple of years back . But Dewalt was always a step or two ahead of B & D in battery tek . Hopefully the batteries will perform well with this set . It is a big investment for me at this point in llife but if it lasts it will be money well spent . I like the bag over the hard plastic cases they used to put their tools in because it does n't take as much room . And I wo n't mind replacing the batteries if I can get good use out of them .	1
I love these . I started a home renovation and felt my 18v line was aging , and I did n't want to lug around cords throughout the house.I am SO GLAD I got the 20v line . The are tight , solid , and powerful . The batteries connect easier and are half as heavy as the 18v line too.I have a Mag77 , and unless I am cutting 4x , I reach for the 20v Dewalt circular 9 times out of 10.I only wish they had 20v nail guns . I have to keep my 18v around because I have their finish and brad nailer .	1
As a homeowner , I 've long been content with a very nice collection of 18V cordless tools , Ryobi One+ , which I would characterize as being great for most around the house projects , but not of professional quality . These Dewalt tools are in a different league in terms of being heavy duty and well constructed . If you go to Dewalt 's online user forums , one of the phrases that struck me was someone describing the drill as `` maybe too much drill for me . '' By this the writer meant that this is a drill for someone who needs to screw wood screws , and bore holes , and change bits constantly for a full days work and go home bone tired . It is not a drill you would choose if all you were going to do was hang picture frames . The same goes for all the tools , they are not lightweight , but they are well constructed and powerful . Apparently , previous editions of Dewalt 18V tools were heavier still , but I have no experience with Dewalt prior to this set . And , of course , heavy is not a synonym for sturdy ; these tools are sturdy , and that 's the important part.I should point out something I learned from online research , the 20-Volt MAX is a marketing term . These are basically 18V tools , the batteries are only 20V anode to cathode while not under load . It 's one of those industry terms where one company starts calling their 18V tools 20V , and everyone else follows suit so as not to be disadvantaged . I think Dewalt is pretty much up front about this , and I think they regret this industry trend.The drill is the superstar of this pack . It 's a combination hammer drill , drill , and screwdriver , includes a detachable handle , and is what they call thePremiumversion when sold separately . As an owner of a brick house , I appreciate the need for a hammer drill when I need to drill a hole into solid brick or mortar , frustratingly hard without a hammer drill , easy as pie with one ( and the appropriate masonry bit ) . I am in awe at the build quality of the chuck on this drill , it looks like it should be on a high end drill press and not on a battery powered device ; easy to grasp , steel exterior , and bits clamp into immobility with a satisfying series of clicks . The detachable handle comes off with a quick rotation . Operation is convenient with a thumb switch to reverse direction and a multitude of settings : 3 main modes , 3 gear levels and 22 torque levels . With the full battery , the tool is a bit heavy , and it is here homeowners might want to think if they actually need a set of heavy tools for their around the home projects . Not to be confused with thecompact hammer drill.I had some left over 3/4 '' Brazilian cherry flooring which seemed like a good pick due to hardness for a quick race between my old drill and the Dewalt . My old drill worked fine , a 3/4 '' paddle bit went right through , maybe snagging just a bit , but the new drill just zipped through nearly effortlessly with the same bit . Talk about things that make you say `` whoa '' , so I did it a few more times just for fun.The circular saw is , again , heavy duty for a cordless tool . Changing the blade is reasonably convenient , just locate the button to lock the spindle while loosening and tightening the blade . It could be easier , but once in place , the blade is solidly attached . Making straight cuts was easy enough , and the blade zips through pine , but lining up angled cuts takes a bit of guesswork and care . Again , my old circular saw , the Ryobi , went through my scrap Brazilian cherry surprisingly well , but the Dewalt was barely slowed . Of course , this was with a different blade , and in real use I 'd have chosen a blade designed for a smoother , less splintery cut . Still impressive.The reciprocating saw is comfortable with rubberized handholds . Good to have given the vibrational beating one 's hands take with long sessions of reciprocating . Saw blade attach easily enough , although not as quickly as with my Ryobi . I 'm a big fan of using reciprocating saws withMilwaukee green bladesfor yard work involving quick tree pruning of green limbs . Regardless , be sure you purchase some reciprocating saw blades as this set does n't have any . I took it and a green blade out to the backyard and had some fun lopping off 3 inch branches , and nearly laughing at how easy it was . ( I love reciprocating saws . ) And finally , the flashlight is nice . It is an LED , thankfully , and quite bright but not obnoxiously so . The beam is wide for an LED . The huge battery makes it a bit oddly balanced , but it also makes it stand by itself well , and it has a convenient twisting head with a ring to hang it as needed.The tool I miss from this pack is an impact driver , and it might be a better value to buy the somewhatmore expensive 5 piece kit with an impact driveras the driver is quite expensive as a standalone purchase . Still , theseparate impact driverdoes come with another charger and two half size batteries , and a half size battery would be valuable to have for lightweight projects or for leaving attached to the flashlight . The 20-V MAX ecosystem also includes acompact drill driver , apremium drill driver , a rotary drill , and aright angle drill . As far as I can tell , Dewalt is not packaging any of these as tool only , meaning you will have to buy additional batteries/chargers along with the additional tools , at considerable expense . I hope this changes.I wish Dewalt provided a more rigid case than the provided duffle , as it is I will probably buy a different tool bag . Also , the battery is not as easy as my Ryobi to use ; the battery takes more conscience effort getting it in the charger and onto a tool , although it 's easier to remove . And the Ryobi has little touches like a bracket to keep a screwdriver bit on the drill or a bubble level.It 's cool seeing these very tools used on Mythbusters , or on This Old House.I 'm very impressed by this collection . So much so that when I needed a router over the weekend , I grabbed the Dewalt compact router with very little extra thought . So , highly recommended for those with big projects .	1
Great compact kit . The 20 volt Max Li-ion batteries are a big improvement over the 18 v. You can add the 1.5 Ah battery if you need something a little lighter weight . Highly recommend adding the brushless impact driver to complete the kit.I use this everyday and have no complaints .	1
I 've used Dewalt kits borrowed by friends over the years , and they 're fantastic . They 're sturdy , last all day , and were great for home use . Now that I have my own set of tools , it 's time to drill and saw . These are typical of the Dewalt tools I 've used over the years . They feel indestructible.The hammer drill was amazing to use . It drove screws in effortlessly . In fact , it made so effortlessly I felt like I needed to find more screws . It rocked . In a way , it 's more of a drill that I 'll ever need . I honestly felt overwhelmed by it.The circular saw is n't meant for people like me who do n't need a heavy set of tools . The blade chewed through 2x4 's . And the blade was easy to install and remove - and it did n't feel like it was going to come out . Again , it 's too much of a saw for casual or light use.Now , the reciprocating saw was by far my favorite . It felt solid in my hands and after use in my parents ' back yard and garage , I did n't feel any numbness or tingling in my hands , which was my major worry . It 's got a great grip and it made cutting effortless.The flashlight was pretty decent . It made a nice worklight . Not too bright , a good wide area . It stood on the ground and did n't move . The bag is the only seemingly `` cheap '' part of the kit . I 'm worried about tools slamming against each other and possibly damaging the blades . It does have interior pockets to keep the charger and batteries separate.Overall , this is way overkill for an apartment dweller , but this is a great set of tools for homeowners . The set has inspired me to take on some home improvement projects . For the price , it 's a great investment . Although I 'd listen to reviewer Glenn Howes ' advice and consider theDEWALT DCK555X 18-Volt XRP 5 Tool Combo Kit - Hammer/Recip/Circ . Saw/Impact/Lightset if you need an impact driver .	1
Throw away any other cordless tools you have . The Dewalt 20v just made everything else obsolete.The batterys have great life and alot of power . The circ . saw works better than i thought it would . The impact is small , comfortable and hits hard . The drill is a beast and the LED can light up the night sky . My only problem is with the recipicating saw . IT works great till the blade kept falling out . The 12v are nice too .	1
2014 Update - Originally when DeWalt released this kit , there was only one option , DCK590 , which I reviewed below . After about eight months though , they released the same kit but with a few very minor upgrades . The circular saw now has a magnesium shoe and the reciprocating saw has four position blade attachment . This revised 'Premium ' kit is DCK592L2 and is the one you should buy . Below is my review for the older DCK590L2 kit : Roughly , three to four times a year , I find myself doing small ( and rarely , mid-sized ) home improvement jobs . Whether it is installing new lighting fixtures , adding new cabinets , replacing a hardwood floor etc , etc ... I have need for decent , but not professional grade tools that are solidly built . For the past ten years or so I have used primarily a mix of corded DeWalt and Milwaukee tools and have usually been pleased , but of course like any other Joe , got tired of constantly fooling with keeping the corded tools powered by using an extension cord . So , with a bit of trepidation , I decided to give this latest cordless 20 volt DeWalt set a shot ( and if it worked well , to sell some of my corded stuff ) . This is my first experience with a decent cordless tool set . During the fall of 2011 , I built a treehouse for my son and a roof over part of my backyard deck . The treehouse took about 30 hours over the course of week and a half and the shingled roof and framing/finishing took maybe ~100 hours over the course of four weeks , working in the evenings after teaching . So , these tools got put to their first real test and did just fine . Here is how the cordless kit did : Circular Saw ( DCS393 ) - Both projects used treated lumber and although I would not call the saw a weak point , compared to the other excellent tools in this kit , it was the weaker link . I was able to saw thru 2x4s and 2x8s with ease and the initial framing went fine . I did run into sometimes slight delays with the two included lithium power packs as one would be finishing charging up as the other had run dry . They do charge up very quickly ( my guesstimate is about 40 minutes ) but when you saw thru dozens of cuts , you can deplete one power pack in around thirty minutes , so you have a ten minute delta of waiting time before you can get back to work ( this is not as evident when using regular untreated lumber ) . The answer was simple , I just purchased an additional power pack and that allowed me to work uninterrupted . I also replaced the stock blade with a much nicer blade as soon as I got the kit . The saw worked fine , but if I were a contractor cutting boards all day long , a more powerful corded saw would be my call for speed 's sake . You can definitely notice a difference in speed between a high amp corded professional saw and this cordless one when making many cuts thru a denser material ( like treated lumber ) . As an example , a 2x8 cut might take seven seconds with this saw if you are in a hurry versus maybe four seconds with a more powerful corded saw . So , I give the saw a 7 or 8 out of ten if you are a contractor and a 10 out of ten if you are a Harry Homeowner . Was just fine for me though , as I dont need to make all my cuts in four seconds , LOL.Recip Saw ( DCS381 ) - Didnt need this as much as the circular saw , but found this to work just fine . Wish it had the different mountable blade positions as other saws I have used in the past . Did very well though when used with the more dense treated lumber . Worked fine with just the two power packs ( with no need for the third one ) . No overheat and no unwanted vibration to the arm either . Have since used this this to great effect for cutting down tree limbs . Give this a 9 out of ten.Hammerdrill ( DCD985 ) - The real gem of the kit . Drills , screws or hammerdrills all in one tool . Used it hour after hour , without overheat or unwanted vibration . Beautiful system for setting torque and power . And have since used it for a smaller concrete job and two duct jobs . Worked fine with just the two power packs ( with no need for the third one ) . For a cordless product , you would not know it . It just works and is every bit as powerful as corded tools I have used previously . Easily a 9.5 out of ten for a contractor and a 10 out of 10 for a Harry Homeowner.Driver ( DCF885 ) - Not used as much as the hammerdrill over the last seven months . Seems to be of the same beautiful quality of the hammerdrill . Very powerful for its size . Unsure , if this value would still hold up if I needed it for long term professional use . Very good vibration modulation for its size . For the Harry Homeowner , 10 out of 10 , especially considering its weight.LED Light ( DCL040 ) - Not quite the same frequency or amplitude ( brightness ) as my MagLight in the garage , but hey , its a frigging flashlight . Bright enough to get the job done and bright enough to easily see by in a pitch black room . Worked just fine . Never got to the point where it depleted one power pack so dont know how long it can last . 10 out of 10 for me personally.Overall , after more than two years with the kit and perhaps 500 to 1000 hours total on it , I would give it a 9.5 out of ten . Glad to get rid of the corded tools I used to own and is a nice addition to my garage . Everything is still going strong and doing just fine . Was waiting for DeWalt to release a 20 Volt Max cordless Jigsaw , and they finally did . I purchased it as well and added it to this set . Very happy with these tools and will continue to add posts every six months or note problems if they occur . So far , five star products for the regular homeowner .	1
I also have a black & decker set with the same tools - the B & D ; tools are fine and are much cheaper , but if you will be using the tools a lot then the Dewalt set will hold up better and give you the better value.The impact driver is the best tool of the set . Unlike a regular drill or screw driver , when it feels resistance it begins to hammer as it turns - allowing you to drive long screws into wood without slipping on the screw head and stripping it . I have used this tool to drive hundreds of 5 inch screws into wooden fence posts - it got hot but just kept on going - doing an excellent job .	1
I 've owned several cordless kits/tools over the last couple of decades . My needs have changed as I 've grown in projects , and my old cheap black and decker sets have long since been replaced by Dewalts . I 've had the Dewalt 18V kits for several years and I 've been very happy with them . They last through most small jobs with one charge . They are solid , beefy , and have plenty of power , but are also pretty heavy . I nearly converted over to the Li-ion packs , but the price always kept me from it . Then came the 12v max line , I thought they were perfect for nearly every small job and home use . They are light , solid , and have surprising power in a compact size . The charge they hold may not last the entire project , but the packs are so cheap you can buy a couple extra to finish up ( and not break your wallet ) .Well now we have the 20v Max line . To be honest , if I did n't need to buy some new 18v packs , I would n't have even considered getting these . But I did , and I 'm not disappointed . They all have the same solid , beefy Dewalt design , but now they are light and compact as well . They appear to be nearly as small/compact as the 12v max tools . And these tools hold a charge for much longer than their 12v cousins . ( Sorry , I have n't done a comparison test on how long they all last , 12 vs 18 vs 20 ) .The new Impact driver is equal to the 18v version but lighter . Function and size seem nearly the same , but the 20v is slightly smaller and a good bit lighter ( the 12v is smaller and lighter then any of them ) .The hammer drill is the same as the 18v version , but it is lighter as well . Size and function seem to be exactly the same , just lighter . ( no 12v hammer drill ) The circular saw appears to also be the same as the 18v . Performance seems just the same as the 18v version ( good enough for quick cuts in contruction lumber , but I would n't want to have to use it for all day jobs or on pressure treated lumber ) .Charging seems much faster ( about 30min or so , but do n't hold me to it as I did n't discharge the pack fully ) .The light is a new design , with just a rotating head , function is fine , but I really liked the old snake head of the previous 18v version better.The new reciprocating saw is the only tool I felt was not on par with the 18v version . It is a much lighter and slightly smaller design , but it no longer has the pivoting head and adjustable guard , and the blade lock is stiffer . Performance wise , it still works just as well as the 18v . After thinking about it , I realized that I never actually used the pivot function on the old 18v anyway , so I suppose I ca n't complain about the loss of it . But if that is a function you needed for your work , then you will be disappointed . NOTE : I just read the manual and found that this kit has the DCS381 model saw which does n't have the 4 position blade and adjustable guard . Model DCS380 has the 4 position blade . So if you need that feature do n't get this kit . It looks like just the two piece kit Dewalt DCK292L2 and the single saw kit DCS380L1 have the DCS380 model saw with the 4 position blade feature.The bag is the soft bag , which is nice for the lightness , but not nearly as protective . I guess you just have to adapt to it.In summary , I 'd recommend this set if you are new or moving up from the inexpensive ( and usually low quality ) brands . If you 're already heavy into the old 18v stuff , I would n't bother with a switch until you have to replace them . In all fairness , I have not had much experience with other brands kits ( some Milwaulkee , a Bosch , and a Makita ) I 'm sure they are all great sets , but I was already using Dewalt so I stuck with them .	1
As most men are , I 'm an AVID fan of power tools ! That being said , I 've had ( and still have ) more than my fair share of different tools and brands , and Dewalt is right up there with my favorite brands . Thus when the DCK590L2 Kit became available in Vine , I was all to happy to give it a whirl.Although I received this via Vine , I 'm ABSOLUTELY NOT predisposed to giving a product a 5 star rating and this being a new battery system , I definitely wanted to give it a thorough workout . Which I absolutely did.I currently own a Hitachi 18v NiCad Kit ( Circ saw , drill , flashlight and impact driver ) , an older Dewalt 18v NiCad kit ( hammer drill , circ saw , recip saw and impact driver ) , and my ( previous to this kit , favorite ) a Makita 18v LiIon kit ( drill , impact driver and recip saw ) . Oh and a $ 50 Harbor Freight 18v NiCad kit ( drill , impact driver , circ saw , recip saw and flashlight ) which although was surprisingly decent , is now in the hands of a female who needed power tools . ; ) . The Makita is an AMAZING piece of kit , and although not *quite* as powerful and robust as this 20v Max system , is still one of the best performers in the industry today . So for me to call this kit my new absolute favorite is saying a lot.-The DCD985 20V MAX Hammer Drill : I used this to drill numerous holes in concrete for 1/2 '' x 2-3/4 '' Wedge Anchors and it was AMAZINGLY easy . The drill had enough torque and power to effortlessly drill 15+ holes like it was corded . I then moved on to using it to drill 6 , 1/2 '' holes into a steel unibody frame to mount a Reese hitch on my fathers minivan . Again , plenty of torque and power . Although these 2 jobs were a couple of days apart , I was still on the initial charge . This 3.0ah battery , no joke , seems like it 'll run forever . This thing is quite heavy and beastly , however . So for the smaller jobs , I still see the Makita getting a lot of use.-The DCF885 20V MAX 1/4-inch impact driver : God I love these things . The Impact Driver is , no joke , one of the BEST inventions ever . And this one flat out performs . I drove HUNDREDS of deck screws with this thing and each and every turn felt like I was driving into butter . Again , battery life is amazing and the 3 LED lights around the chuck really help out when driving into light challenged areas . The DCF885 really blew away the other Impact Drivers in my stable ( including it 's 18v brother ) , which again is saying a LOT.-The DCS381 20V MAX reciprocating saw was used to do everything from demo work ( wood/metal studs , drywall , etc ) to rather large tree limbs and again really impressed me . Definitely the best of the 3 that I currently own . Battery life was amazing as well . Although , I would definitely NOT reccomend using a 1.5ah battery on either of the saws.-The DCS393 20V MAX circular saw was used to cut SEVERAL pieces of timber for a deck that was being built and was absolutely up to the task . Great power , with great battery life . With as much wood as we were cutting , I figured I 'd have to use a corded saw , but both batteries ( one swapped while the other charged ) managed to make it through the whole build . Although for oddly enough , the blade that was included in the kit was rather dull and had to be replaced almost immediately.-The DCL040 20V MAX LED work light is actually QUITE bright . Easy on par with any of the mid-high end 1 watt LED flashlights currently available.-The charger is a high speed charger , takes about 30 minutes to charge and can be used to charge the 12 volt MAX batterys as well as 20v . A nice touch.All-In-All , I continue to be highly impressed with this setup . Although pricey , you definitely get your moneys worth . Black & Decker continues to churn out top quality , industrial grade tools with their Dewalt line .	1
I purchased the 18 volt XRP in 2001 and then when that combo unit rans its course , I bought this Lithium Ion combo . It does n't disappoint . I built a 14 ' x 10 ' shed , with 1 charge on the battery . With my XRP 's , it would 've taken about 12-15 charges . Excellent product .	1
I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband along with all the other items to complete his Dewalt set . They are high quality tools . He was the envy of his buddies .	1
I love this item specifically because I no longer have to haul out 600 ' of electrical cord to use it on my property . Hooray no more long cords.Every tool is top quality	1
If you are used to purchasing cheap stuff from the local hardware store , then a $ 580 kit is going to scare you - and rightfully so . This is a lot of money for a set of power tools . That said , if you actually do more than just hang a couple of shelves , then this kit is obviously not going to let you down.Lets start with the basics : The box : the box this kit comes in is a piece of crap . Upon arrival , the inside soft bag was already poking through three of the corners . It is taped on the tops only , so the corners will most likely rip in transit . That said , all the tools are quite well packaged inside the soft-bag , and some of the parts even come in a bubble envelope , so you do n't run much risk of damage.In the kit , you 'll find the charger , two battery packs , the drill , impact driver , circular saw , reciprocating saw and an LED light . It also includes a basic saw blade for the circular saw , but no bits and no blades for the reciprocating saw , which is a bit of a shame.The drill is simply incredible - this thing weighs a ton , yet is comfortable and extremely powerful . I took it for a spin on several materials , including the concrete floor of my garage , and it had absolutely no problems with what I threw at it.The impact wrench is a tough one -- it 'll help get screws out , but do n't expect to use it to loosen the lug nuts of your car . The LED light is relatively bright , but I get more lumens from a $ 20 Costco LED flashlight . Both saws are what you 'd expect from a kit like this ; powerful . Speed control on the reciprocating saw is a bit lagging , and its lowest speed can be a bit too slow to get things started.The charger has one minor issue that annoyed me -- its LED is RED only . It communicates with you with flashes , so when it is full , it stays fully red . Call me a whiner , but I prefer a charger that shows green , just like every other charger on the market ... Other than this , the 20V `` MAX '' is of course mostly marketing , as the cells themselves probably only produce 18V ( hence the `` MAX '' part -- they will show 20V without load ) . Still , this is one killer power tool set , and if you do some `` real '' work around the house , this kit will NOT let you down .	1
I am thrilled with this reciprocating saw . I 'm a big DeWalt fan , and the performance of this saw certainly lives up to the DeWalt reputation . It is very solidly-built , nicely balanced , and the grips make it easy to hold on to even if it bucks . I 'm especially fond of the 4 way blade grip ( makes flush cuts a snap ) and that you do n't need a tool to change blades.I was concerned about power since I 'm used to using my 20+ year old corded Milwaukee Sawzall . I 've switched to cordless tools for pretty much everything else , but the cordless reciprocating saws I tried in the past just did n't match the power of my trusty corded Milwaukee.Well , the corded Milwaukee is going to be spending time on the shelf . I 'm pleased to report that the 20v lithium battery provides more than enough power . Zips through lumber with embedded nails like a hot knife through butter . Same with metal stock - as long as the blade is sharp and up to the task , the saw has n't let me down one bit.The run time varies by what you 're doing but I 'm averaging about 30 min per charge . You 'll want to have at least one more battery at the ready since recharge time is about 40 min . That 's my only complaint - the kit should have included 2 batteries instead of just one . It also would have been great if these 20v batteries could be used with the 18v NiCad tools , but I can understand how that would be difficult or impossible to engineer.The case is plastic but quite sturdy , in usual DeWalt fashion . I do miss the days of metal cases ( my Milwaukee has a metal case , but I think they switched to plastic as well in recent years ) but plastic has its advantages as well.Easy to handle , lots of power , decent run time , and solid construction . Ca n't ask for more than that in any tool . Highly recommend .	1
I also have the 18 volt Black and Decker and Ryobi reciprocating saws . These blows them out of the water . Im remodeling a 112 year old house with real 2x4 's and they are hard old wood . This saw eats right through them with a good blade and the battery life is over twice as long as the other two were when they were brand new . This new lithium 20v line is the way to go if your gon na use your tools often and want the batteries to remain in good condition	1
Got this to help put up a LOT of fence , and am really impressed with the power and battery life . This replaces Milwaukee equipment , also really good but completely disappointed with the batteries . Dewalt has a very good reputation , now I know why .	1
It 's built well , works with my other tool batteries . I purchased this toll and the drill in the kit form , and the rest as bear tools to save money .	1
Best Reciprocating saw I 've owned yet . This saw has the guts to chew through some wood and metal . I 've had other saws with quick release blades , most of them broke or jam after a while . This one is ease to use and works great . We 've put them through some heavy use and can not come up with a complaint , which for my guys is says a lot . Dewalt is doing something right with this 20volt line of tools .	1
I love this thing . It 's sturdy , produces lots of light , it 's LED and lasts a long time on the battery . However , it 's easy to over-pay for this . The price on this item fluctuates a bit . from like $ 30-50 . On average i noticed it 's about $ 39.99 with Prime . Would n't pay more for it . I love the fact that it fits my 20V batteries . We lost power a while back and I got to use this flashlight for a while before the power came back on . Love it ! A must have in any toolbox that has 20V Dewalt tools in it .	1
This flash light provides a bright white spot light . It is not a flood light as the beam is more consintrated . Design is nice . Construction is mostly plastic but appears to be pretty durable . I upgraded from my old Dewalt 14.4 volt to the new 20 volt max and this flash light is much better in design and light output .	1
This light is good , but compared to the snake light on the 18v system , it could have a few improvements made .	1
The trigger on it seems a little finicky but the light is otherwise great ! It would be nice if it had a two power switch that was better built for longer life low power and brighter for when you need it .	1
When I got my drill/impact set for the 20v line , after falling in love with their quality and battery life I decided to get the reciprocating saw and flash light as well as a set of the 1.5ah batteries . This light is very bright , works great with the smaller 1.5ah battery and no need to worry about a bulb burning out like I always seemed to do with my old 18 v black and decker and ryobi sets	1
This is a nice light that is really functional , bright , and light . Gives off a nice white light and you can carry it anywhere . It is smaller than I thought , but that is fine too . It would have been nice to have other hanging or clipping options as you either have to stand it up or hang from it clip , not the best options when you need to shine it in a specific area but do not have the hands to do it or a friend to help . Otherwise , a great lamp .	1
I 've bought this flashlight and was expecting it to be like most led flashlights ... .Turns out it is a fantastic flashlight ... It 's way stronger than my previews favorite 3 A batteries flashlights ... I really thought that led flashlights would be worse , like rayovacs and other low-end brands ... .I was simply amazed with this product . Once again it carries the DeWalt well known brand and as all the dewalt products I have it works perfect ... ..It 's really bright . It 's flash goes further than 30 meters ... Really a great work light and also a bright flashlight for regular use ... .	1
Nice bright light will fit in well with my other tools ! ! ! This is going to come in handy ! ! ! Thanks	1
Works well and is bright.I use 4.0 Ah batteries and they last forever.I can still use battery for power tool even if light has been on a long time .	1
This light is everything I expected and more . It 's very bright , battery lasts a long time because of the LED bulb . You can easily hang it with the loop on top .	1
Some people complain about the focused beam , but after receiving mine , i found their points of view to be slightly exaggerated . This little light is amazing . I am using it far more than i thought I would as I find more and more reasons for keeping it handy . HIGHLY RECOMMEND.Also , at less than $ 40 on Amazon.com , this is a much better buy than anywhere else . I do n't know who is making money here ... I suppose Amazon.com is also an authorized distributor of DeWalt products . If that be the case , than the big box stores and other local hardware stores do n't stand a chance at competing ; but hey whatever works . Innovation drives future successes .	1
This thing is BRIGHT ! It 's a perfect little addition to my new 20v Max kit . The tilting head is nice feature .	1
This flashlight is an excellent worklight and a must have for those who own any other dewalt 20v max tools or batteries . This flashlight does NOT come with any battery.The light has a single LED with a reflector . The resulting light has a very bright hot spot in the middle with a surrounding circle of light . That said , if you need a flashlight that provides a very wide beam of bright , even light , look elsewhere , or make a light diffuser to go over this flashlight head.Construction is solid.. it has the feel of a drill with the ruberrized grip . Screwholes on either side of the base for installing a drill bit clip and/or a belt clip . However , no clips are included.The flashlight head pivots up and down . I would approximate the range is from -5 degrees ( 5 degrees below horizontal ) to 110 degrees ( 10 degrees past vertical ) . Clicks in the hinge allow you to click the head into a desired angle.A hook at the top allows you to hang the flashlight . When not needed , the hook snaps into a retracted position.The flashlight was smaller than i expected , with a thinner handle than dewalt drills . Compact , light , rugged , bright , buy it !	1
This is the perfect compliment to your Dewalt 20v drill kit . Good quality and it works fine . Nice and bright with a good switch and the head angles .	1
The LED outpu , 110 lumens beam shines very clear and very brightand shines a long distance , approximately 200 ft plus.The beam is actually clear ~ how very nice to find a light that is1 . NOT yellow-sh like the old flashlights2 . NOT blue-sh like many LED flashlights3 . Does n't have the dark center like 'mag ' lights do.Both DeWalt batteries ~ the 20 volt 1.5 Ah and 20 volt 3.0 Ah Li-ioncan be used with this light-weight flashlight.It 's head is pivoted to turn down some or straight up.It has a very rugged metal hook for hanging , that also locks down out of the way.And of course it sits firmly , flat on the battery.This light is all around rugged ! I bought the light only , it was n't in a kit , about two months ago at Lowe 's for $ 50.00 plus tax , and have used it nearly every day , several times a day ~ since.Initially I fully charged a 20 volt 1.5 Ah DeWalt batteryand the light is still bright and shows no signs of needing charged yet.Because of the price , it 's best if you can get the light included in a kitor already have other DeWalt cordless tools.It 's a wonderful light , but it would be ridiculously expensiveif you did n't already have a DeWalt charger and some Li-ion batteries.I initially thought this light was very expensive and almost did n't buy itsince the light alone cost $ 50.00.But since I already have the batteries and a charger , I thought I 'd try it.And now that I see what an all around great light it is ~even for how expensive it is ~I absolutely love this flashlight and would n't want to be with-out it .	1
I purchased this as an afterthought . It actually works well , It sets on the battery like a stand , and the beam is narrow enough I can position it so I can see what I 'm doing without blinding myself . The three amp battery is a bit of overkill for it , but then again it 'll go all day on one charge . It 's also a nice backup when the power goes out . Just note it does not come with a battery . If you have other 20 V max tools you can use their batteries , or you can purchase one separately . I would recommend you buy the 3ah battery far it , since it 's heavier and makes a better stand , the 1.5 battery is a little to lite , it 's to easy to knock over .	1
I got this light as part of a 20 volt MAX kit I got recently and am pleasantly surprised . Most of the lights included with toolkits are throwaway afterthoughts and are barely useful . The DCL040 changes that . This guy is rugged , easily positionable and QUITE bright . Actually it 's brightness is what really sets this apart . I 'm kind of a flashlight junkie and the DCL040 really gives some of my flashlights costing twice as much a run for their money . The secret is the CREE manufactured 1 watt LED . CREE LED 's are pretty much cream-of-the crop and give off an extremely brilliant white light , which when coupled with a good reflector design , blasts your working area with a blanket of illumination . Which brings me to my next point . Runtime . LED 's are notorious battery savers and this light is no different . Specs rate this as being able to last up to 11 hours with a 3.0 Ah and my own tests confirm this . I was able to get 11hours and 6 minutes of run time before the unit shut off . Which is awesome compared to the incandescent light that came with my Makita Lithium Ion kit , which only managed 4 hours on a 3 ah battery.As I stated earlier , the DCL040 is easily adjustable and positionable . The head can be pivoted 120 degrees and attached to the back is a metal clip that allows the light to be hung for hands-free illumination . But here 's where I ran into the only major issue . The pivoting head . Although it is detented and clicks into place , it 's not tight enough , so the head is easily moved if bumped . I mean , it 's not loose enough to flail all around at that slightest touch , but it is quite easy to move . Not a deal breaker , but worth mentioning.All-in-all , I am quite impressed with this work light and can definitely reccomend it to someone looking for a bright , somewhat compact light source that will stand up to the day-to-day rigors of the job site .	1
Great tool . I am an experienced DIYer and I have one of these lights in my plumbing box , in my electrical box , and in my general tool box . Thinking about putting one in my cars too . There slightly overpriced , but considering that you 'll probably never have to buy a replacement battery , not too bad .	1
Bright , sturdy , and lasts forever on the large capacity batteries . It 's also surprisingly adaptable at getting the light where I need it working on cars .	1
Really pleased with this purchase ... feels comfortable and manageable in the hand , especially when using a 1.5A battery over the larger 3A 20V . I like that there is a flip up loop for hanging in a hands-free situation . Very bright with a focused center and broad outer beam . Overall , definitely the best work light I 've used .	1
I purchased this flashlight as part of a Dewalt / Amazon end of the year promo.I would not have paid full price for the flashlight due to a limited tool budget.That being said , this is a great flashlight and I 'm glad I bought it.It is bright , you can hang it , or just set it on its base ( battery ) and angle it where you want it.If you have extra 20v Max batteries and want a great LED light this fits the bill .	1
Keep in mind that when you are finished , you have $ 100+ flashlight . You need the light AND a battery And a charger sold separately . I have the new DeWalt tools with the brushless motors that use these new batteries , which are 4 amp . These tools generally come with two of these batteries . I also bought two extra . So , it is an expensive light , but it is bright . There are cautions about looking directly into the LED ( Light Emiting Diode ) . Believe it and do not look directly into the light - you risk retina damage . The head tilts ( a little too easily for me ) and there is a hanger . The light is not heavy and the over-molded grip makes it comfortable to use . It has a three year warranty as do the batteries . Keep in mind , that if you buy the light and battery , you will need a charger . This is not a problem for me as I have the other tools that use these batteries and they all come with chargers . Kind of a long way of recommending this light is only if you have the new DeWalt tools that use this battery . If you do , the light is an excellent value . If you do n't , well read my first sentence again and then decide .	1
I have previously reviewed the Dewalt 20v combo kit with hammerdrill and impact driver , adn decided to purchase this wonderful LED light . This really was a great addition and works wonderfully for my purposes . It throws outa brilliant white light that does not bother my eyes . I will say that it is pricey and I probably would n't have paid more for it . I paid $ 40 for it a week ago and now the price is up to $ 46 , and more than likely I would n't spend much more on it than that . Do n't get me wrong it is a great light but you can buy a bevy of cheap LED lights and some more brighter than this one . I justfied my purchase by wanting a light that works with my 20v batteries , of which I have 4 compact.As a whole , I love the 20v line and am excited for it 's future . I am also invested into Milwaukee 's m12 line and would like to see DeWalt take an idea from some of Milwaukee 's innovative tools . I am planning on getting some 4.0 ah batteries , definitely the jig saw , circ saw , and sawzall , and hopefully the 1/2 '' impact wrench with 300 ft/lbs of torque . Thanks for reading , Ray .	1
Item is very useful . I especially like the fact the you can set it down and adjust the light to where it is needed .	1
This is a great light but I had to return one , the first light I received would start blinking after about 20 min of use . I scheduled a return though amazon and they promptly shipped me a replacement . Because of the failure of the first light I cant give it a full 5 stars . The second light has been flawless but it does run quite hot . The trigger area warms noticeably after about 10-15 min of use . I have used this light for home projects and have taken it along on a few camping trips , I have n't been able to burn through a full 2.0AH battery even with hours of endless use . In comparison to my surefire lights I would say the stated 110 lumen output specification is pretty accurate .	1
I have a pile of DeWalt 20V Max batteries , so I bought this flashlight to try and get more use out of the batteries.The flashlight is very handy since it 's always sitting right next to my toolbox , it 's design makes it easy to grab , hold , and use , and I know I will always have a battery handy . The fact that it stands upright on the battery is a big plus.As others have noted , the brightness and beam are the two weaknesses for this flashlight . It is simply too bright for most situations where you are holding the flashlight close to your work . The reflected light is blinding . The first improvement DeWalt could make would be to provide more than one brightness level . A low and high , or low / medium / high would be a huge improvement.Second , the very tight beam is a problem in many workshop situations . If they made the beam adjustable , like the old school Mag Lights , it would be a fantastic feature . The trend with LED flashlights to make a laser-like tight beam is not very helpful for many situations . Sometimes a broad beam is much more valuable.I 'd gladly pay more money for the flashlight if it had those two features.Other than those two weaknesses , it 's a very useful flashlight .	1
One of the first Dewalt 20v tools I have purchased and it is a world of improvement over the 14.4v light it replaced.This light and the Dewalt 20v Brushless Driver make a potent go anywhere fix anything combo .	1
This thing is extremely bright and gives long battery life . I am thankful the days of the incandescent lamp are gone !	1
Love this light and how bright it is.It is multi-functional and the adjustment head goes vertical about 70 degrees up and down.Sadly , it does not focus or have any horizontal movement which is the only drawback .	1
I got this light as part of a DeWalt 20-Volt Max tool kit . I figured it was just filler to make me think I was getting a better deal , but it turned out to be a very nice light . It 's very bright . Not quite as bright as my 950 lumen LED spotlight , but the sharply focused beam is plenty bright to use for nearly anything around the house , finding stuff in the yard at night , or working under your car . The color of the light is a very neutral white , not the bluish tinted white that you might expect from an LED light . The weight of the battery makes the flashlight very stable , and there 's a chrome hanging loop if you happen to have a hook , nail , drawer knob , or anything similar available.I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of a frosted snap-on floodlight lens to help disperse the light , but I found that I could get a floodlight effect by either shining the light at something nearby ( 2x4 , drywall , white cardboard box , etc ) . Better yet , I was able to get a long-lasting and very effective MacGyver area light by attaching a paper coffee filter to the front of the light with a rubber band . Just form the filter into a rounded ball shape ( think Pac-Man ghost here ) and attach with the rubber band . Much brighter than a fluorescent work light , and lasts for many hours per charge.The base has holes for an optional DeWalt belt clip , and I recommend adding one for carrying the light around . It 's too big to fit into a pocket ( not counting that giant pocket on the front of bib overalls ) , but it 's easy to hang off of a belt with the clip attached .	1
DEWALT DCL040 20-Volt MAX LED FlashlightGreat deal , I 'm not expiriencing the problems others are having , I use it at work all the time , I work in construction , so far so good .	1
Did not buy this , got 18v light to match my other De Walt 18v batteries . It has a few more features then my 18v light , but I wanted to stay with the same 18v battery system that I already had .	1
I finally bought this rotary hammer after constantly pulling out my corded hammer drill for small quick jobs ... I wanted something a bit more convienient . I did n't expect much more than the ability to drill out a couple of holes that were only a inch or two deep ... However , this unit has exceeded my expectations ... . It 's got much more power and performance than I had expected ... I 've drilled holes 6 '' deep without a problem , chipped out tile , and even broke out small pieces of concrete ... It 's become my go-to hammer for all my light to medium work ... Its lightweight and the anti-vibration works perfectly ... I recently used it to to chip out stucco for removing 9 windows and really loved its performance and ease of use - all on one battery ... . Very happy with this Dewalt Rotary Hammer ...	1
I upgraded from 18v to 20v and gave my old 18v stuff to my son . He is happy and I am happy , how can you beat that .	1
Got this unit and started drilling 1/4 & # 34 ; holes in block wall for furring strips the very next day . I have a 1 & # 34 ; corded and wanted this ( I HATE CORDS ) to do the every day stuff . Good chipping & # 34 ; just to knock down burrs and sloppy mortar & # 34 ; and the SDS sure beats a regular 18v hammer drill . Drills faster , bits last a long time and I am not tripping on cords . Pretty good run time on the batteries too..	1
i love this drill . it is light but packs a lot of power . since i got it i have used it many times and had no problems . it is very light and small in size . i would highly recommend it .	1
I received this tool around the first week of Sept 2011 . I already have a corded hammer drill , and I install commercial doors , windows and frames . When I am on a long-term install , I will be using a corded SDS drill , but I also do service , and small jobs . Too many times to count , I have needed a 1/4 inch hole and a plastic anchor to hold a frame in place , or a threshold , and only need 4 holes , and as you all are very familiar , a drill with a hammering feature ( non SDS ) hardly EVER works on concrete , and if it does , you just burned up at least one bit on one hole . The day I received this kit , I opened the box and put the batteries on an extended charge , first . While they were charging , I went a got a 1/4 inch SDS bit , and a small SDS chisel , and a granite rock . I 've drilled granite for frames , and it is hard to drill , and is hard to chip . For 15 minutes , I drilled holes and chipped to my hearts content . The power is unexpected and in trying to kill the battery , I did not . The MAIN reason I bought this is for the CHIPPING FEATURE . You ca n't find another manufacturer in the 18 volt class with the chipping feature ( that means hammering without turning . Many many times I have needed to chip away just a bit of rock hindering the installation of an aluminum frame or threshold and have to break-out the cord . I prefer not to use cords unless absolutely necessary . Two main reasons : 1 ) Someone is going to pinch your cord ; 2 ) Someone is going to get tangled in the cord ( probably you . ) This unit has no problem drilling holes . Holes it was designed to be drilling ... I have drilled a 1 inch hole through 4 inches of concrete , and it works great , but the is NOT what it was designed for . Really it is for drilling anchor holes up to 5/8 inch all day , and chipping away anomalies such as rock , concrete and pesky screws . It is VERY compact and agile enough to drill holes in concrete while you are 10 feet up a ladder installing a window frame , without worrying about someone yanking you off the ladder with a tangled cord . Also , I have been getting RAVE comments on it . It is the talk of the company , and I plan on using the hell out of it . I will update in one year : Sept 2012.Cons : NO BELT HOOK ! ! ! and no BARE TOOLS offered . I do n't need 88 batteries for 5 tools , and I DO N'T use cases . I USE tools that 's why they make the Husky rolling bag .	1
I have n't had the chance to do a direct comparison yet , but this rotary hammer looks like it will be able to do what I have been doing with a somewhat larger heavy duty corded rotary hammer . And this is much lighter and not corded . The jury is still out on how well it holds up over time and how many unique uses I can have for it .	1
DEWALT does ; that 's who . The best battery ever . Charges fast and lasts a long time . The price is high , so look around on line , you can find it much cheaper . People buy the tool and sell the extra battery . Buy the tool with the 1.5 Ah battery and purchase a 3.0 Ah battery and turn your tool into a heavy duty model .	1
After my old B & D drill kept running out of power , decided to purchase a new drill set . Opted for the DeWalt 20V hammer drill and impact driver combo with the 3.0Ah batteries . The combo came with 2 batteries , but the special at the time gave me a third battery FREE ! ! Talk about a great deal ! Now I 've got as much juice as I can use .	1
It 's a DeWalt , need I say more ? As expected , build quality is flawless , ergonomics is great , weight is light and longevity is twice that of the smaller batteries . The new series of Lithium Ion tools is fantastic .	1
I 've got a pair of these batteries with a hammer drill / impact driver I bought from DeWalt . I really loved these batteries . Here 's my opinion : The material : The materials used on these batteries is really strong plastic . They offer some scratch resistance even if its not the main requirement for the product . They are extremely well-made , all the parts fit perfectly against each other . The release button is really strong , allowing for many connect and remove the batteries without a problem . Their size and weight help give the tool a really good balance . A 5 star rating.The battery life : These babies last longer than I would expect from cordless power tools batteries . I can use the impact driver on a daily basis without having to recharge them during a month period . They provide all the power needed to perform the toughest tasks without even complaining . I 've been using them to manufacture power supplies and for each power supply I have to fasten at least 36 hex M8 screws ... I can assemble at least 3 power supplies a day for the whole month and the batteries are still good to go . A5 star rating without a doubt.Overall : These batteries are really tough . They last for a long time , and they take only about 1 hour to fully recharge . I 'd surely give them a 5 star overall rating . The only bad thing about them is the weight , but nothing is perfect . So much power and life really comes with a price.I would definitely recommend these for cordless power tools .	1
I bough this to have as a spare for the new 20V drills that I had just purchased , it works as good as the OEM batteries .	1
Yes , it costs more , yes it lasts a LOT longer , yes it saves you time and yes it has a lot of power . This is my first experience with Lithium in more expensive tools and I 'm sold . Used it outdoors a LOT , saves me a lot of time going back and forth to the charger ... oh , and it charges really fast too .	1
Received 2 of these in the DCK590L2 20-Volt MAX Li-Ion 5-Tool Combo Kit I got and am highly impressed . So impressed that I bought 3 more . This single and a dual pack . Although technically this is really an 18 volt battery , it 's performance is much better than the 18 volt ni-cad batteries in my old Dewalt tools . Not only is runtime enhanced , it 's also much lighter and I love the new slide attachment vs the older clip attachments . It holds much better.I 've used this battery on pretty much every tool in the kit and am continually impressed . For instance , when in use on the Impact Driver , I was able to drive 100+ screws into hard wood before needing a charge . Using the drill , I was able to drill several holes for 1/2 '' x 2-3/4 '' Wedge Anchors , then drill 6 holes in a steel car frame and still had battery left over . The saws , while harder on the battery , were still able to be used to cut several pieces of timber for a outside deck.Dewalt definitely has a winner with the new 20 Volt Max line . I just really do n't like the trend all tool manufacturers are taking with the `` Max '' ratings . Reminds me too much of car audio . But this does n't really matter as long as the tools/batteries perform and these definitely do.I will say , however , these are quite pricey if bought by themselves . But DeWalt is n't alone with it 's battery pricing . Most of the `` contractor-grade '' tool makers tend to get a bit crazy with battery pricing .	1
lightweight great battery and slim and easy to use ... these slide in instead of grab and click ... better feature and charge is long lasting	1
For several days I traveled in and out of a building where rooms where being framed out of one large room . Every day I felt a little sorry for those guys when I saw their old worn out cordless saws and drills struggle . Eventually I threw the tool bag in the trunk and let them use my brand spanking new set of 20v tools . When I came by to pick them up at the end of the day the project was complete and NCOIC reciprocated by giving me free pickings to all of their scraps plus excess lumber purchased for the job.Since then I 've gotten a fair amount of use out of them as well as I build this and that with my newly acquired supply of free lumber.Even the old man who built everything from cabinets to complete room additions with hand tools growing up , when I mentioned my new tool set said , `` are they lithium ion batteries ? ... man those are nice . ''	1
It was free , what else can I say ! . it is cheaper than the older 18v Li-Ion batteries but last longer ? makes you go hhmmmmmmmmmmmmmm ! Are they pushing cheap prices just launch these new products ! Maybe , go ahead and egt'em while you can !	1
last longer and stronger than 18v . Especially useful in circular saw performance , wet pressure treated woods now can be cut	1
The Dewalt DCB200 20 volt battery perovides extended time with use with my portable drills and impact wrenches . I would recommend this product to those wanting extended battery time using portable tools .	1
This batteries is great . I have all the 20 Volt Dewalt tools and this battery is so much superior to the smaller one it is well worth the price . I recommend to anyone to upgrade to this higher capacity battery .	1
Save some cash and get the 2 pack . Just be sure you get the newer ones that have the life indicator on them . So nice to be able to see how much life is left in each one . No sense getting the older ones now that these are out.Battery life is amazing and they are much lighter than the older 18v version . A must for anyone needing new or more batteries for the 20v system .	1
have the entire line of dewalt 18v battery tools and am currently upgrading to the 20v . These batteries seem to have the same quality as the 18v li-ion but I love the new slide design .	1

It 's a nice product and being a lifelong DeWalt consumer , I can say that these batteries are 100 times better and more efficient than the old XRP batteries . I built an entire 10 x 15 shed with just over 1 battery charge . Awesome .	1
Ordered these for my husband for Christmas . He loves all things Dewalt ! They are excellent quality and will be very useful .	1
Bought them used , but they were still sealed in the original retail package . GREAT ! As far as the battery . Noticebale difference from the 1.5amp batteries that come with your puchase of the drill . I do n't understand why they do , i understand marketing , but that underminds the integrity of their product . Built tough to last weak ? I spent over $ 300 for the new 20volt drill/driver . Using a inch paddle bit on the impact driver , made about 6 holes in 2x4 lumber , before a noticeable change in performance fromt he 1.5amp stock battery . Im a little disappointed in dewalt , because here i am spending more money to get something i should have had to begin with ! There is no reason for 1.5amp battery for dewalt products . NO REASON ! I am paying for quality , not below average quality . Thats my beef with dewalt , but needs to be said . Wish these 3.0amp 20volt batteries came stock , would have been happier with more money in my pocket ! Plus side , i now have four batteries , but one charger !	1
I have owned DeWalt tools for over 30 years . Started out with the 9 volt systems and worked my way up to the 18 volt . I had no problem selling all my older 18 volt tools and went to the 20 Volt Max Li-Ion system . These batteries are some much better and lighter weight and smaller in size . I have noticed they last much longer between charges than the old 18 volt batteries and only time will tell about the longevity . My biggest complaint with the old batteries was after a few years they get to where they do n't take a charge and you have to buy new ones every 2-4 years . For someone who does n't use them very often that is disappointing . I used mine off and on with various projects that I would do where I use them alot and then not at all for awhile . I think they have got it right with the lithium it is just too bad they cost so much more but if they have the longevity then it will be worth it.Also I have had to use DeWalt 's warranty recently and have nothing but praise for the way the company handled replacing a battery of mine with-in the warranty period .	1
My husband has the tools that this rechargeable battery is used for , and he loves having two that he can switch back and forth . He always has one charging while using the other . This is a replacement for one that someone stole , so my husband is apparently not the only one who likes them .	1
Get set with tons of power . Makes short work of anything . Really compact yet powerful . Can not think about anything bad about it .	1
this came as an extra for a dewalt drill kit i bought a long time ago , they still hold charge , very please with their performnce !	1
These batteries really do hold their charge and perform really well , of course nothing compared to the new XR lineup by Dewalt but it 's handled everything I 've thrown at it around the house and I ca n't complain . I do n't always use my drill and only charge the batteries when they get low . Batteries hold strong even after months of not being used . My original review is below , and while it 's an awesome deal if you can get this extra in a kit ; the batteries themselves are pretty awesome too especially with a Dewalt 3 year Warranty.When I bought myDeWalt DCK280C2 20-Volt Max Li-Ion 1.5 Ah Compact Drill and Impact Driver Combo Kit , this was included for free . It really helped to offset the $ 300 price tag of the combo since the battery itself is $ 75 . I really like the design and lightweight of these smaller 1.5 Ah batteries though . They last a while , charge fast , three year warranty and simply stand up to the Dewalt name .	1
The re-designed clip of this lithium ion battery is awesome , and long overdue.It fits Dewalts new 20 volt 1 1/2 ah drill and impact driver , DCK280C2.The same set and design also comes in a 20 volt 3 ah combo.Some of Dewalt 's drill designs have been awkward to use.Such as , you ca n't reach the forward/reverse button with the thumbof the same hand thats holding the drill.And the buttons of the Dewalt traditional style battery pack requirea long reach by your thumb and middle finger to reach some hard to press buttons.Both of those issues have been addressed.Now when you hold the drill , the forward/reverse button is at thumbs reach.And this battery has one easy to press buttom on the front of the batterythat releases the clip , and the battery slides out.Now this is a smooth operation ! The lithium ion 20v charges in 15 to 30 min . depending how low the battery is .	1
I got this free as a combo with my drill set . Having three of these batteries is kind of pointless unless you are on a job with no charging . Last a long time under heavy use and store the charge as long as needed .	1
I bought 2 of these batteries and they work great . I use them primarily with my impact driver and it really makes for a lightweight and powerful combination . They work equally well in my drill driver . If you plan to use them in the hand saw I would recommend buying the 3.0 Ah batteries as these will allow for more cuts between charging . A great battery I would highly recommend .	1
Thought this book would be chock full of great projects for use with my Kreg Jig , instead , it 's chock full of ugly projects . On the other hand , for someone with little or no experience in building , this book is well written with some right to the point info to get a beginner started .	-1
This light is useless for reading in bed next to someone . Even the one bulb lights up the entire room and blinds you with the reflective light from the book/kindle . It 's going to be great for camping , ghost hunting and the like , but you have to put a cover over it to read by . Maybe I should have read the `` MIGHTY '' part of the Mighty Bright .	-1
These seem abnormally sized for the type of fixture they 're supposed to be mounted in . I had to manually clip the prongs to fit all the fixtures I tried them in . Seeing as how they 're branded for a G8 base you 'd think they 'd fit in G8 bulb sockets ... But , they were fixable with some elbow grease .	-1
These burn out really fast . I buy them because they 're cheap and it 's more cost effective to change the bulbs all the time , but some of them last like 3-4 weeks .	-1
Two bulb legs broke off two of them , as I was soldering them into the board . Ridiculous . Other than that , the remainder worked fine .	-1
I have two of these lights . One works better than the other . Neither is a good asNewhouse Lighting NHCLP-LED-BLK 3-watt Energy-efficient Clamp LED Lamp , Black , which is also available at Amazon for a few dollars more . The problems with this lamp : The clamps do n't hold well . I had to try several different locations before I got the lamp to stay where I wanted it.The gooseneck is too flimsy . It is hard to keep the light where you want it.The LED light is a bit harsh in a dark room where this is the only light and you are reading . ( Is n't that what this is for ? ) The lamp also shares a common problem with many devices like this . The transformer that converts household current into the low voltage used by the LEDs is at the very end of the power cord . When you plug it into the power outlet , it blocks not only the one you plug it into , but the one next to it . I had to use a power strip to plug in two lamps , and lost four spaces instead of two . There is an alternative design , putting the transformer in the middle of the cord , that avoids this problem . Maybe that costs more , and price seems to be the major differentiation between different products like this.Do yourself a favor and get the Newhouse Lamp instead of this one .	-1
I purchased this for my son to use while hes doing his school work and reading in bed . The good thing is that he can use it on his desk and his bed via the headboard . The arch neck sometimes just falls so it doesnt hold that arch for long periods of time could be cheaply made . Another issue that we noticed was that the light would get hot , equivalent to an incandescent . I purchased this because it was LED and it seemed like it was durable . I think it should be in the 15 dollar range or less , not worth over that ... .	-1
I really liked this until it failed.If it had lasted more than a few weeks , I would have bought a carton of them .	-1
My desk lamp was a bust . Imagine my surprise when shopping Amazon for a new one to find the same IKEA lamp that went bust for me with a lot of reviewers experiencing the same problem I had . I thought I had a bad lamp and waited too long to return it but evidently , the problem with the cord is an IKEA design issue.I loved this lamp -- as long as it worked . It has a weighted base , very flexible neck and nice bright LED light on a small head . But it was n't too long after using it that the bulb started to dim . Initially , if you toggled the switch , it would brighten back up.But eventually , there was nothing that could be done to find that sweet spot . I tried taking the switch apart to see if it was wired badly but the switch is glued together and could n't be taken apart.So now I have a lamp that I love in style and functionality , that does n't work , and I 'm having trouble finding a reasonably priced replacement that matches up to the size/style . Bummer . I agree , IKEA should be recalling this since so many are having the same trouble .	-1
Porter Cable has a design flaw with the trigger locking switch . To use this in a router table , your must lock the trigger on and use a switch located on top of the router to turn it on . The problem is the switch lock breaks easily and the router will not function properly . I found this out the first time I used it in my table and sent it away to be fixed . After the fix , the repair lasted 20 minutes . I am now looking for another router to use in my table . I will only use the 7529 for hand held applications where I constantly hold down the trigger myself . Porter Cable should have a recall on this . I am not the only person with this problem . I posted my problem on a tool chat room and other woodworkers shared the same story . If you want to use this router for a router table , get another router . Save yourself the trouble .	-1
I bought this router shortly after it was introduced thinking it was the next best thing since sliced bread . Man was I wrong ! For handheld use , it is stiff , cumbersome , and unbalanced . It 's worse in a router table , which was the main reason I bought it . I thought the second power switch would be handy for table use , except you have to lock the handle switch in the on position . And in order to do that , I had to tape mine just so the switch would lock into place . The height adjustment is a pain to work with . Overall , this is one of the worse routers I have used . If you want a router for a router table , spend the extra money and step up to a 3 HP router	-1
I could not believe that the PC teck said that plunge routers all have play in the shaft . The right side has such play that you can tilt the router base by applying pressure to one side even when locked and he said this is normal ! I have a RE600 Ryobi that is solid in all positions . I tested the DeWalt621 and with one post it was solid . The depth adjustment is also very hard to set , you have to turn it many revolutions to get it to adjust . The dust shield falls off easily . I returned it after one day .	-1
I was very disappointed with Porter Cable . The plunge mechanism sticks , the on button is hard to lock on for router table use , the depth gauge is extremely hard to use , and it is not compatible with most after-market accessories . Mine is sitting on a shelf . In its place is a DeWalt 621 plunge router . It is lighter , has a much better depth gauge and is just better all around . I love my DeWalt 621 . I wish I had bought it first .	-1
I prefer brass . The Porter Cable guides are fine , they install easily , center easily , and perform flawlessly , , Most of the time . Just once in a while though , they fail completely . Steel , no matter how you protect it , will eventually corrode . Mine turned white and rusted , not all over , but on one side or the other . My guides often get removed from the case and hauled out to the job-sites while attached to the router . Early , foggy mornings and those sudden summer-time cloud bursts , expose my tools to far more of the elements than I like . So maybe , , it 's my fault . But brass just has n't let me down yet.Search `` brass template guide set '' and be amazed at the difference in price and the fact of the quality of these `` no-brand '' guides . Occasionally you may need to shine them up a little , but being solid brass , that 's not a big problem . I 've used both steel and brass on door hinge templates , dovetail templates , stair tread templates and strike plate templates . Brass just slides easier , smoother . On dovetail templates , especially plastic and soft aluminum the brass guides show less wear on the surfaces that the guides contact.I 'm sorry P.C . , , , I ca n't recommend these guides.I saw a review with a problem , the steel guides were too long and reached past the bottom of the dovetail template . With brass you can simply file the guide down to size to get the right length . Simple .	-1
Porter Cable 42000 Template Guide KitI 've had a 42000 template guide kit since the mid 1990 's . The set works OK , but my advice is to buy another brand . The P/C kit comes in a cheap & fragile hard plastic case that must have cost all of ten cents to make and the components are held in place with inexpensive cardboard separators . In addition , after a dozen years or so , every component in my set had corroded terribly -- the metal looked similar to very old aluminum storm windows , pits and all . It 's not clear why this happened , since they 've never been outside the basement workshop , and no other tools corroded . The corrosion caused significant resistance when screwing on the lock-nuts . Steel wool reduced the roughness of the corrosion , but the pieces still look dreadful.The three largest guides in the P/C set are too long for numerous dovetail jigs , such as the Leigh jig . It 's possible to modify them to work with these jigs , by hack-sawing the excess length off the offending guides , flatten the cut end on a grinder and sanding the edge smooth . A no-cost approach.If you want steel guides , the Milwaukee 's 49-54-0700 set comes with a nice case , and the steel finish looks a whole lot better than P/C 's . Unfortunately , the three largest guides in the Milwaukee set are also too long for many dovetail jigsIn any case , brass is a better material for guides than steel , because brass is easier on a rotating router bit if it ever touches a guide . Once , near a day 's end of routing doors for hinges , my template 's locking ring came loose , allowing the guide to touch the spinning bit , and the locking ring to rub against the router-bit lock nut . Since the guide and ring were brass , no noticeable damage to the bit or router occurred . Had I been using any steel template with a steel locking ring , the bit or router could have been damaged . Try `` brass router template '' via Goggle - and buy a kit made of solid brass , in a decent case , for less money than this set . Also check out the Woodstock International H3134 Brass Bushing set at Amazon .	-1
I have other Porter Cable products that work well . The quality & design of this edge guide shocked me . It could have easily had more than an additional 2 '' of travel with a simple design change . Or you could shorten the beam by 2 '' and have the same usable travel with a design change . The pins that adapt it to the router are .014 '' under size and the spread between the mounting holes on the router are .025 '' more on the base than on the pin location on the edge guide . Now when you tighten the screws to fasten the router to the edge guide , they will cant the pins so they are not clamped parallel to the holes . This is shoddy quality control . Even the screws are an obsolete size which has n't been used much for more than 25 years . The screw size by the way is # 12-24 . Most think it is a 5mm , but it is not . I make the assumption they got an extremely good price on these obsolete screws . These damned screws if you can find them are over $ 2 per screw at a place that sells parts for this edge guide online . That does n't even consider the cost of shipping and handling . My qualifications are : I have worked in the tool and die trade for 46 years . I have been a supervisor for more than 25 of those years . I have been involved with the design and fabrication of many things that have complexity far beyond this simple edge guide.I would n't be so irritated if the company had the courtesy to respond to my Email , but I have waited since 1/7/2008 and seen nothing except a automatic reply on 1/7/2008 telling me I would get an answer within a few days . This has never arrived . I rate it as a 1-star only because I have the skills to make it more usable.I have but one way to deal with complacent companies such as this who seem to have a screw you attitude with customers . I will simply never purchase another of their products.The following is the Email I sent to them : Where do I contact someone to talk about problems with quality control and design flaws concerning my Porter Cable Router , Bases and Edge Guide ? I was a practicing machinist , toolmaker , shop supervisor and was involved with design engineering in a research facility for over 46 years until I retired a year ago.I would like to talk to someone who is willing to listen seriously with an open mind and correct some problems . I also have a few questions I 'd like to ask from someone involved with design.I just spent the last hour making precision measurements and find it hard to believe what I discovered.12/21/2009Since I wrote this review , I have never received a response from this company . I 've concluded I have no use for a company that does n't respond to a customer 's legitimate request . I wo n't be purchasing any of their products in the future.S Schultz	-1
I bought this sander and tried it on a group of pine butt jointed boards . It is too unstable . It tends to tip at the slightest opportunity towards the motor side . Even a slight pressure on the back causes a gash in your work . I spent more time removing scrapes and gashes than smoothing my work . Very frustrating . I am going to try a different brand as the others seemed to be more stable in the store and did n't tip so easily .	-1
Received it for a Christmas gift and it sat in my shop for a year . Recently I needed it to sand a counter top I was building , so out it came from the tool cabinet . I cut the plastic bands from the box , hooked up the dust bag , adjusted the tracking and started sanding . In about 15 minutes the sander began to slow down and sparks were shooting from the brushes . I also was getting an electrical shock from the trigger . I check the Internet for solutions and decided to change the brushes . It destroyed 2 sets of brushes and sparks were still shooting out of the motor . This sander is a piece of crap and I think the dust collection is garbage . The entire motor housing was filled with saw dust when I was sanding . I 'm really starting to doubt the quality of porter cable tools . For $ 200 dollars , I think their quality control should be a lot better . I think I might try a makita next time . Always try a new power tool when you get it before you put it away . Lesson learned .	-1
I have a lot of Porter Cable tools , and I 'm one of the company 's biggest fans . I love their routers , their circular saws , their biscuit joiner , and I have them all . But this is without a doubt the worst value in a tool ever.Here 's what 's good about the kit:1 ) The profiles are handy when not attached to the sanderHere are the problems:1 ) First of all , the profiles never REALLY fit what you 're sanding , so there 's always a point early-on during the sanding where the aggressive action of the sander wears right through the sandpaper and you start leaving black rubber streaks on your material ( the profile is now rubbing the wood directly ) .2 ) The machine is not smooth.3 ) It 's noisy.4 ) The profiles wo n't stay in the holder . They fall out.5 ) PSA paper ( uses adhesive ) . Not much fun.So ... there 's my opinion . I consistently rate this as the worst purchase I ever made as far as tools go . Save yourself some money and buy the profiles separately . All by themselves , they 're usable . Attached to the aggressive sander , they last about 3 minutes before you 're burning rubber.Sorry , PC ... I would have loved to have said something more positive !	-1
This thing is too big to work with and awkward to hold . The profile holders come off the machine during use and the adhesive paper does n't hold to them well . The H & amp ; L paper work well on the triangle foot , but you can get something easier to user for a lot less money . All in all you need something smaller , lighter and with ( wire or other ) clambs to hold the paper .	-1
This is a very heavy constructed piece of equipment . It feels good in your hand , although it feels twice as heavy as my Bosch , which means that you do n't have to apply any pressure to sand as the weight of the machine does a good job of that . The vibration is substantially less than my Bosch , but it gets so hot that you can only use it a few minutes before you have to let it cool down for 20 minutes . I tried to use it longer , thinking that it would reach a peak and I could bear that , but that is not the case , it just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter . It would be good for frying eggs , and making coffee .	-1
Works nice when it works , which is not very often.I 've had 3 separate failures in 3 years of occasionalhobbyist use . I have now spent more on ordering partsfor this POS than I spent on the original sander .	-1
I am very disappointed with this sander . I thought it would work great for sanding large table tops . Instead I have found that a large belt sander ( 4x24 ) followed by a finishing sander does a much better and quicker job . I have the Porter Cable 4x24 sander and the Porter Cable 330 finishing sander .	-1
This sander is great in the beginning . It works like a well built machine , and then , it happens . For some reason , this thing gets out of balance and ceases to do a good job . It wobbles all over the place . My shop owns 6 of these that were all bought at the same time , now after one year of daily use , 4 of them are unusable because of the counter-balance.PROS** Can apply alot of pressure** Very strongCONS** Gets out of balance** Brushes hard to change** 2 hand sander	-1
PC 97366 has so much vibrations that I had to give it gift to my enemy.. Horrible ... then within a week , I got a Xmas Gift of Home Depot Card and I used it to buy Rigit Sander from Home Depot for $ 139 ... ( I SAID , I CAN RETURN IT IF I DO N'T LIKE IT ) WHAT A SURPIRISE THEN ... THE RIGID IS SUPREME SANDER WITH ZERO PAIN IN HAND AND AWESOME GERMAN BUILT ... GREAT BUILD QUALITY AND 3 YEAR WARRANTY ... YOU CA N'T MISS THAT ... I CAN NOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD RIGID SANDERS ARE ... BYE PORTER CABLE ...	-1
To make something out of what appears to be a hard plastic type of material , then mount it on something that does random orbits and except it to last is like mixing oil and water.Got tired of replacing these pads , the cost adds up quick , figured there had to be a better way . Came up with a method that works very good so thought I would share the idea.What I did was to get a small piece of metal , for me I used what is called a Simpson Strong Tie . This is a piece of rectangular metal with many holes in it . Is used in construction to hold boards together by nailing the plate across the joint . Found these to be both cheap and tough enough to last and thin enough not to cause problems.Simply cut it to fit the circular base , small enough not to block the vacuum holes . Marked and drilled holes just large enough for the mounting screws . Using JB Weld , attached this cut out to the hook and loop base . When the epoxy was set up good enough , mounted the pad back onto the sander letting it sit 24 hours before using.The metal will make the pad last a long time and will not egg shape like the plastic does.Works very well ! !	-1
While this trimmer might be fine for quick roundovers and the like , it lacks the refinement and precision necessary for fine woodworking and production work . Careful observers will notice that the base and motor are not perfectly perpendicular to one another . There is too much slop in the height adjustment mechanism and set knob . Too , the base itself is not perfectly flat ( place a sheet of 400 grit sandpaper on a flat table and run the base plate over it a few times . High and low spots will quickly become apparent . ) All in all , the 7310 is very underwhelming in its quality and precision . As far as the & quot ; Rotozip & quot ; style trimmers go , the DeWalt and Bosch models offer better quality and refinement then this PC , though they , too , suffer from some of the same problems.By far the better alternative is the tried-and-true Porter Cable 310 production router . This model has long been a favorite of professional cabinetmakers ( the guys in my shop own two or three each ) , but it is somewhat unknown to the woodworking public at large . It is not made for mass market consumers ( Home Depot/Lowes do n't carry it ) , and PC has instead promoted the 7310 trimmer as its mainstay trim router . The 7310 trimmer , however , is but a shadow of the 310 . Read some of the reviews on the 310 and you 'll see what I mean . The 310 is truly a fine machine . At $ 100 , the 7310 is not a great value . At $ 159 , the 310 is worth every penny . Spend more now and you 'll be very satisfied with the knowledge that you own the very best . More importantly , your work will show the wisdom of your choice.Sadly , Porter Cable no longer sells the excellent offset , angle , and other optional bases for the 310 . If you need these you can acquire them used or new-old-stock , but they are getting harder to find . The premium prices of these trimmers and optional bases found on Ebay attest to the loyal following the 310 has . These bases are available for the 7310 , but you will still have to deal with the inferior design and quality of that trimmer . Again , go with the DeWalt or Bosch if you need a complete trim kit with all the bases . If you do n't need them , get the 310 and you 'll be set for life . You 'll be glad you did .	-1
The bulbs that came with our flashlites lasted for 2 years , these bulbs lasted for 2 weeks . I was shocked to see HD getting $ 9.99 for 1 bulb so i tried these . I do n't know what is different , but the $ 9.99 bulb is still working .	-1
My local big box store sold me this bulb for my Porter Cable 18v Lithium Flashlight ( model PCL-180FL ) . After about one half hour of continuous use the flashlight stopped working . Upon opening up the lens holder I discovered the bulb had melted through the bulb holder . Fortunately , the Porter Cable service rep took pity on me and is mailing me replacement parts so I can fix my flashlight . None the less , before buying this bulb , make sure it is truly compatible with your flashlight or you may end up destroying your flashlight . The correct bulb for the Porter Cable 18v series of flashlights ( e.g . PCL-180FL and PCL-18FL ) is a KPR 18v 0.3amp krypton bulb ( Porter Cable part number # 90534275 ) .Ultimately what Porter Cable/Dewalt ( they are the same company ) need to do is release an LED conversion kit for their flashlights .	-1
These were thrown in the bottom of a much larger box of other items . They were shattered . Completely worthless and not worth my time to mess around with returning them . Pain in the but . Should have just bought them at lowes or HD . Do n't but these from amazon . They have n't figured out how to package delicate products yet .	-1
Normally I love Dewalt tools but this thing is worthless . Imagine the light produced by a $ 2 flashlight you buy at a grocery store , and from an 18 volt lithum battery ? I ended up just throwing it in the garbage .	-1
bought to work on my car in a dark garage . The battery base hardly gets the lamp on it 's feet unless you have a long irregular surface . there 's one spot on my engine ( over the fuse box ) where it can stand.even then , the wire that holds the light up does NOT support the weight . i 'm always having to leave the cable in a weird position so it does not succumb . it 's very frustrating . the reach of the arm is practically zero as i always have to leave the lamp dropped somewhere . it can never be raised on the metal arm.Look at the pictures . see that the ONLY pic with the lamp raised it 's almost vertical ? that 's the ONLY position the arm will hold . deviate one degree and it falls to the floor in slow motion.i 'm now using it as an expensive lantern around the house for when the lights goes out .	-1
march 23rd this scroll saw will be 1 year old , machine is making knocking sound . have to bring it in to service center . this machine for the price should last years under mild use . this machine lasted under a year with only about 2 months of total use . Not happy .	-1
It had it for 5 weeks before it just quit completely . I brought to the local Dewalt repair center per Dewalts service center recommendation . After waiting 2 weeks for it to be repaired , I called them and they said they had to send it off to the factory and it would be another week . After another week they said it would be another week so I called Dewalt to ask how long it should take and they said it was between me and the service center . I asked if they would call and find out what was going on and they said no . I asked what a resonable time frame for repair was and they said 2 to 3 weeks but it was up to the service center if they would issue a new one to me . I got the number to the factory and they said another week . I notice on the box it says made in Tawian and not Canada , so I am guessing even if I do n't get it for another few weeks I mightg as well wait since they will all have problems because of low production quality in Tawian . Every tool I have ever bought from them in the last two years except my router has quit working , I think I will quit buying thier products.My problem has been resolved by Dewalt they are sending me a new unit .	-1
This DeWalt light came with a scroll saw/light/stand package deal at another website . The light looks great and mounts quickly , but that is where the excitement ends . The gooseneck is far too weak to support its own heavy head weight given the mounting location on the saw , and how horizontal the light needs to be to reach the work area.We ended up supporting the light halfway down the gooseneck by using two zip ties to secure the gooseneck to the upper saw arm . We used a piece of foam between the gooseneck and the saw arm to prevent vibration and paint damage . Taking this weight off helped , but is tacky looking . Considered mounting it to the saw stand for a more vertical mount , but then it would be in the way of large work pieces.The on/off switch has a nice snap and weight to it , so it feels like it will last . We are using this saw/light in a room with poor lighting . The bulb is plenty bright . The head/bulb gets pretty hot . In the right position to prevent shadows , your forehead is pretty darn close to the light , but its fine.If you bought your DeWalt scroll saw without a light , and you 're looking for a light now , look elsewhere until DeWalt finds a better Chinese supplier . The current light is not up to snuff for this application.UPDATE : 1/27/2010 HEY DEWALT - LISTEN UP ! I did this review without looking at the other reviews . Just ran across the review and decided to read the others . To my astonishment the reviews have not changed in 10 years . DeWalt , that is just pathetic . How many more of these lights do you need to sell to get rid of the batch you had made in China 10 years ago ? Enough already , do your customers a favor and throw the whole lot away and find a better light . Is this why I got the light 'free ' in a package deal with the stand ( nice stand ) , so I ca n't complain because I got it free ? Well , this product number still has your name attached does n't it ? It is obviously a problem , you know about it , manage the issue.Shoppers - until you hear from someone that DeWalt has replaced this light , steer clear unless you get it 'free ' . If free , then you can do the zip tie thing or figure something else out to make it work ok .	-1
I 'm dumbfounded that after all of these years , DeWalt still has n't corrected the ongoing problem with the flexible neck being too wimpy to hold up the light for very long . I thought , jeez the most recent review looks to be 2011 , there should be an improvement by now ... lol , nope . I finally removed the thing , got one of those magnetic base work lights with a stiffer goose neck , stuck it to the DeWalt metal stand , problem solved for now . I may try mounting the Dewalt light directly to the stand by drilling two holes , bolt it down and orient the goose neck vertical instead of horizontal ... it might possilbly bear the weight of the lamp better and not sag .	-1
I guess its my fault , I bought a new DeWalt scroll saw and figured since the saw got 4 and 5 star reviews the light was safe to buy . I was wrong . I attached this light to my saw and it will not hold its position . There are reviews going back all the way to 2006 with this issue and DeWalt still has not corrected the problem , I am losing faith in the company named DeWalt , it 's bad enough they are being ran by the same people who run Black and Recker , but DeWalt had always seemed to build a quality product , but since they made Porter Cable a second or third tier tool company it seems DeWalt may be on the same path as PC is on . It 's a shame , too few real companies own too many tool company names . They have eliminated their competition by buying them up and keeping their name , so today you have 5 or 6 tool lines being built in the same factory coming down the same Chinese assembly line . They seem to have sacrificed quality and workmanship to save a buck or two so they can sell their tools in the Big Box stores . DeWalt and Porter Cable use to be top of the line tool companies , a tool you could buy for a little extra cash but would last forever , not anymore .	-1
My last Dewalt scroll saw work light was everything I could ask for and had no problem ordering another one 3 years later . This one looks exactly the same but the flexible neck does not want to stay in any position but straight for more than a few seconds . Somehow they must have changed materials or specifications and got it way wrong . I will have to make modifications to the saw to try and improve the function of the light . Needless ot say I was disappointed based on the performance of the one from 3 years ago .	-1
Overall , this is an `` ok '' light that I will probably replace with something else - I should have read the reviews a little more carefully prior to ordering this . The light 's arm is not strong enough to hold the light in the `` up and over '' position I want it to be in - you are basically stuck with it being just a couple of inches away from your work . That was probably what the designers had in mind as the can is only rated for a 25 watt bulb that is a pain in the neck to screw in ( why does it have to be so tight fitting ? ) ; I like a lot of light around my projects , and even with every light in my shop on plus this little scroll saw light it is barely adequate.I would save your money and buy a separate light that cranks out the power - you want to be able to see your work without the distraction of the light can being so close to your project .	-1
Just sent this light back . Did n't even get to the plug it in and turn it on part . The flex neck is so weak it ca n't even hold the fixture up . Might as well use a table light . Searching for a new fixture now .	-1
I own multiple DeWalt products ( Drills , Table Saws , etc . ) and have had great experiences with them all ... .that is until I purchased this light during a recent purchase of their Scroll Saw . Love the saw , hate the lamp . The lamp is not very flexible and tends to drop towards your work in progress due to the tables vibration . Further , unless you are working in pitch black , the provided light bulb does n't provide ample work light , that is if you can screw it in . The space allotted to screw in the light bulb is so tight , it is almost impossible to change . What a let down . I would offer that is it a pretty effective back scratcher ... ..	-1
I bought two of these but Dewalt designed them and the saw poorly.Holes on both sides of the saw are in the exact same place so when you put in both , they can only be pushed in half way , so they stick out.They also fit sloppy , not something I would expect from Dewalt.What they should have done is offset the holes so they could be pushed in for storage . Other saws do this , its not hard.Other than that , they work fine .	-1
Ok I admit it , I misread the advertisement and thought I was buying a pair ( set ) of extensions . For the price , I feel one extension set is a rip-off and DeWalt should consider selling a set at a price somewhere between $ 32 for 1 set but certainly not $ 64 for 2 sets ( list price is $ 88 for 2 sets ) .One set is useless when , for example , sawing crown moldings or similar instances . Nobody wants to keep switching the extension back and forth .	-1
These extension wings will be fine if you want them permanently mounted on your saw . I returned them because they are not easily removeable for saw storage . My Hitachi saw has similar wings that slide in and out with one top mounted set screw , the Dewalt requires mounting from beneath the saw and are not made to install and remove readily , so I returned the items.I decided on the Porter-Cable PC136MS Universal Mobile Miter Stand for my DW716 miter saw . The Porter-Cable stand is well worth the money and Amazon has is for less than I paid and shipping is free . The stand is excellent . I also used separate roller stands for support for my 20-foot long 2x8 's I was cutting .	-1
If you think that you actually need these things then you probably need more skills not more tools . I found them to be awkward to work with ( especially when working with several moldings at once ) and completely unnecessary .	-1
For every pound of sawdust created , this maybe captures an ounce . What 's up with that ? My DeWalt 705 still rocks though !	-1
I really like my DeWalt sliding compound miter saw , and got this bag for it when I started using the saw in my garage shop ( as opposed to outdoors projects ) for dust control . It is only a little bit better than using the saw without it . I would say the dust capture is 20 % at best.I found that I am a lot better off for dust capture if I attach my shop vacuum to the port where this bag is supposed to attach and have active suction to pick up the dust . This captures about half or more of the dust . Overall , though , it seems that there is a reason there are dust hood systems with large hoods to capture miter saw dust into a collector : a lot of the dust does not exit through the blade guard , but spews right off the top of the cut.Conclusion : do n't bother with this , it 's not good value and it gets in the way .	-1
Despite the hefty price tag and prestigious name , this saw wo n't hold a blade ! My first one would n't ... and neither would the replacement Home Depot gave me . Nothing I did would make a blade stay in . Call to the factory elicited this comment : & quot ; Yeah , we get a lot of complaints about that. & quot ; Duh ! Tried it one last time and -- the motor went out ! I finallly bought the top-of-the-line Craftsman ( made by Bosch ) and no such problems -- it 's a honey .	-1
I must own about 20 DeWALT tools and this is a frustrating tool . For the most part I really like DeWALT tools but this one needs to be redesigned . The blade will not track straight . The problem seems to be in the blade mounting system . I have never had a problem with the blade coming loose , however as you screw the cap to tighten the blade you can see the plunger start to turn as you crank down on this thing . Since you tighten to the right , the blade will end up pointed to the right . Now I have found that if you back off slightly you can line it up , but that 's not the way a jig saw should work . I think that in this case you would be better served with a Bosch .	-1
This is the second Dewalt model I tried . I can not recommend it . The most important feature of a jigsaw in my opinion is to be able to make a square cut while following a line , curved or straight . This saw can not do either . The plunger that moves the blade up and down has a very large `` play '' sideways . You can move it with your finger side to side by more than 1/16th of an inch . That kind of movement translates into a larger movement at the cutting area of the blade . So no matter what kind of cut you are making , curved or straight , the blade wants to wander . Once it moves 1/16th away from your line , you apply force on the saw to move it back . That makes it worse . As you make a curve , the blade deflects more and more as you get into the curve , making the cut not square . You end up with a very rough cut even with finest blades . You have to cut proud of your line and waste time sanding . You can do this test at Home Depot or somewhere you can see different models . Take this saw and push the plunger sideways , then take a Bosch and do the same . You will see that Bosch is rock solid , does not move visibly , whereas Dewalt is lose as if they forgot a bolt or two . I bought a barrel grip Bosch and I am happy..	-1
Could not get the blade to track stright . The saws shaft is lose and will shift while using . I have many other DeWalt tools I have been very happy with , but this saw stinks . I sold mine at a loss and bought a Bosch ***** stars for the Bosch .	-1
The Dewalt looked good in the store but I 've been a little disappointed . The machine needs a soft start on the motor to keep it from jumping when you pull the trigger . Once I learned to maintain an iron grip , I realized that the mark that is supposed to indicate the height of the cut from the fence ( or sole plate ) is much too far off to be useful at all . Most of the time you do n't need to use the mark - if you just maintain reference surfaces carefully , all will align ok - but sometimes one has to use the marks and on this machine the marks are n't accurate at all . Having to make complicated setups and test cuts sort of overcomes the purpose of the machine - which is to increase speed . Finally , on my machine , I notice that when using the sole plate as the reference , actually the aluminum casting extends below the sole plate , so that the sole plate does n't sit flat on the reference table . Yes , it can be fixed with a ( substantial ) bit of filing ... . but having to go to this extreme on a new tool , which may not be the most expensive but even so certainly is n't cheap , does n't seem reasonable to me.I know that some claim that the biscuits are n't for alignment but that 's nonsense ... . since the initially-compressed biscuits expand to fill the slot , then by definition they WILL align the parts . Or , misalign them if the slots are a little off . Plate joining seems like a faster alternative to mortise and tenons when the full goodness is n't needed , but this Dewalt is n't a precision instrument .	-1
Everything about this was awesome , except that the unit I bought , the blade was slightly out of parallel with the fence ; about 1/32 '' higher on one side of the cut.If I could guarantee a parallel cut , I 'd buy this again ; until then , going with a PC or Makita .	-1
Here is my story ... after two attempts to purchase this joiner , I went with the PC 557 . Both of the Dewalt models I bought had their fences racked which caused the biscuit slots to be cut on an angle . Cutting a # 20 slot was off about 1/8 '' from left to right . Plus , reports of the chute clogging are true . It was worth $ 30.00 more to get the PC .	-1
I read the reviews and had it narrowed down to two jointers ; DeWalt and Porter Cable . I decided that the price was right on the DeWalt and figured it would do the job . I tested a few joints with it and noticed that the wood was a little off . I figured that it was user error and continued on with my project . Then I decided to check for sqareness off the adjustable fence . The pointer lined up just past the & quot ; 0 & quot ; mark and sure enough it was off . No problem , I thought , since it had an adjustment screw , I could not adjust it to where I needed it to go . I had to file the stop block to get it at & quot ; 90 & quot ; . This failed to fix the problem with the line up of the wood . I finally measured the cut and found that it was a 32nd higher on the right side of the cut . No matter how I hold the tool to the surface it was off . A visual look at the blade and you can see the blade comes out at an angle . Bottom line , the mechanics of the tool are strong , but the machining of everything else hooked to the motor needs more attention . It is going back tomorrow . A 32nd sounds picky , but it sure racks your project when you put all the biscuits in place . Not a good tool for fine woodworking projects.Update : Fine Woodworking magazine did a review in their September/October 2001 issue and out of 12 jointers , DeWalt had the worst score for biscuits out of parallel . Exact quote was , & quot ; although I can live with 0.017 in . out of parallel , biscuit joints assemble with less fuss when the number is 0.007 in . or lower. & quot ; Lamello Top 20 came in at 0.000 and Makita came in at 0.001 . The Porter came in at 0.005 . They liked Lamello , Porter , Makita , and the DeWalt even after what they found . Being a casual user , I think I will consider the Makita because of the cost savings .	-1
The cast aluminum base had a hump in the casting 90 degrees to the plunge travel . Do n't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base . Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease . Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper , and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table . Then rub it flat , and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate . I just do n't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool . And no , I did n't send it back for an exchange ( not purchased from Amazon ) . It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base . It would have taken two weeks for an exchange , which may or may not have been from the same production run with the same exact issue . Who knows ? In summary I have been duped by advertizing to expect that tools with DeWalts name on them should perform reasonably well out of the box . This one did not . Being gullible is my own fault so I am only deducting three stars . Not because the tool did not eventually work well , but because although I paid DeWalt ; they did n't pay me to do their work for them .	-1
The face of the edge guide that touches the workpiece is a problem on the unit I got.It has two pieces , basically split vertically in half if the router is also vertical . One of my pieces is bent slightly towards the workpiece , or perhaps one piece is bent slightly away . It still works , but honestly is my most disappointing purchase as far as quality goes ; not good for very accurate cutting .	-1
DeWalt tools are not great , to reveal my bias up-front . This one , however , is especially bad . The fence is a piece of stamped steel that is not very precise . Two plastic ( ABS , I think , not even nylon ) rectangles cover the fence and then a shoddily cast alignment mechanism sits off the back end . The alignment mechanism can rotate about 10 degrees in either direction along the stamped steel fence ( not intentionally , either , it just sucks and is imprecise ) and there is a lot of slop in the whole design.One of the worst attributes of this guy is that because it 's so loose and sloppy , you ca n't get repeatable measurements - even if you align a clamp on a workpiece and then expect the fence to act as a & # 34 ; stop & # 34 ; , the distance from the router bit to each end of the fence can shift slightly as you use the tool , so your results end up being slightly off at all times . Really pretty horrible , considering that routers are precision tools.The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the steel rods were fairly straight . I know it sounds trivial , but that 's apparently a lot to ask for with DeWalt . Seriously , buy a different router/edge guide if you can .	-1
I purchased the Dewalt because their tools are historically of good quality . This sander does not seem to take too much off even if you use 80 grit paper ( my little mouse sander does better job ) and as for other features , I agree with the others that the dust port keeps falling off and the switch is suspect . But my variable speed option still works though . After using it on a project for about 20 hours , the bearings went and I had to get it fixed . Once this sander quits on me , I think I 'll opt for the Porter Cable .	-1
I own this sander because it came as a freebie promotional perk with my DeWalt planer ( check out my DW733 planer review if you 're interested ) .The sander has problems . First , I 'm not a big fan of forced-air dustbags in the first place , but this one is particularly annoying because it always falls off from the sander 's own vibration . I ended up having to put a self-tapping screw in it , which I then have to undo before emptying the bag . Lame.Second , the bigger problem is that the random-orbit mechanism appears to have failed after only about four hours of use . The pad is no longer rigid -- it wobbles off-axis and it 's all I can do to hold it flat on the workpiece while sanding . It tries to dance around all over the stock -- I literally can not move it in a straight line while it 's running . I 've been a journeyman architectural woodworker for nearly ten years , so I think I 'm qualified to say that the unit is not functioning as it should.I 'm going to try to get some resolution from DeWalt , which I should say has been pretty good in the past with other issues . However , since it was a gim me along with the planer , I 'm not holding my breath.I 'll post an update when I can get in touch with DeWalt .	-1
I found that it was necessary to keep retightening the chuck if the operation involved any amount of vibration , like using a hole saw in plywood . I have a DeWalt drill with a keyless chuck and it stays tight in the same circumstances.For some reason DeWalt includes a cheap plastic storage case with some drills but not with others . The cases are made of very flimsy material with crude fasteners . Buying one for a drill that comes only with its cardboard box involves spending nearly $ 40 . Milwaukee and Makita provide sturdy plastic cases with their drills so I do n't know why DeWalt does not do the same .	-1
I bought one of these for my father , a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs . At first , he loved this little drill . The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle-switch could be dangerous if you were n't paying close attention to what you were doing . In the end though , what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing . After only a few jobs , a plastic component around the motor cracked , allowing the teeth to slip under strain . A DeWalt service shop charged ... to fix this problem . The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out . It was a great idea , but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work ... I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill .	-1
Horrible little drill ! ! ! ! No variable speed , no reverse ! ! ! You better be perfect because god forbid you must back a screw out , no reverse . Hard to start screws w/o variable speed . I replaced this drill w/ bosch 's 1132vsr rt . angle drill . I am happy with the bosch , it is head and shoulders above the dewalt . I gave the Dewalt to my father in-law .	-1
I bought this because of the deal and dewalt name . Turns out the item does not operate at a consistent level as far as screw depth . You may get one or two perfect then a bunch that are not sunk in the dimple . Bad product.If you buy one of these , try it ! Do n't let it set around like I did and get past the return date . Fairly obvious that whoever had it before me realized it would not work consistantly , and returned it.My bad ! Found out after asking on a DIY forum that the dewalts are know for this inconsistency !	-1
I picked this drill up at Home Depot where the display and box said `` Drywall and Deck '' Drill . Now I was buying the drill to do some framing 2x4 to 2x4 's with 2 1/2 screws . I found that the drill bit would bounce around and spin in the screws at the slightest provcation . I ended up pre-drilling each hole . Even still slow or fast it would bounce out and begin the stripping . Oddly about every 4 screws zip in one would go . I finished the job . My 14.4 Dewalt cordless drove them in flawlessly . I even tried the same bit in this one and no luck . I think the problem was the degree of speed was difficult to control and the drill over rev'ed . Larger treaded drywall screws were no problem . This is not a deck screw drill .	-1
The first unit would not allow the spreader to snap/lock into it 's frame , so I returned it and just received another one which the spreader locked into OK. After installing and straightening the item to the table , the spreader was offset from the blade by more than 1/8th of an inch , ... ..top and bottom ! Due to the resctictive lower bolt hole , in this device , there is no lateral adjustment available to line the spreader up with the blade . I have a 2006 left tilt 36-L31X Unisaw and according to the information for this item , it should have worked on my saw . I contacted Delta for advise ... they had no answer , and said to return the item . I noticed that the spreader metal is quite soft as it was not straight right out of the box . I suppose this may be for minor adjustments . The anti kick back units are also quite soft as one of those was bent and laying against the spreader . Definitely not the quality of Delta of yesteryear !	-1
This is one item I would recommend people purchase from a local dealer not Amazon . Like another reviewer mentioned the packaging is terrible . I received mine and the small stationary wooden top of the table was broken into three parts even though the external packaging showed no real damage . This part breaks where it has grooves routed into it across its width , it is so badly supported I would expect it to get broken in shipment more often than not . The movable part of the table top also had some cosmetic damage . Amazon has been helpful but a replacement top arrived damaged as well . I just ended up making my own parts to fix it . The table is actually pretty good and I needed a fold down table given lack of space in my garage .	-1
I 've seen some off-shore poor-quality product sold by Delta in the past - I know it 's what you need to do to compete in this market , but this out-feed table is the worst . Besides the enormous amount of time that it takes to install , adjust , re-adjust etc , the quality of the table and laminate is garbage . The shipping from Amazon left minor damage around the edges . Laminate peeling , cracked , etc - but parts missing is no excuse . I knew that my options were to return it or exchange from Amazon , so I decided to call Delta directly who told me it would be several months until the new part was released and on top of all that - I had to pay for it . When they sent me to the warranty call center , they simply sent me back to the general info number . I can now see that Delta is no different than any of the off-shore clone woodworking products that are out there . You are for sure better off building your own in this case . It 's not close to the quality of the machine that it couples up with , in my case an older Unisaw . Sorry Delta !	-1
Well ... After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed table delivered , i 'm going for number 6 . I should give up , up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood . ( i should just give up and build one myself . ) It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece . All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another . The last attempt , direct from Delta , was the worst . The part was shattered in several places , almost beyond recognition.Needless to say , I 'm VERY disappointed .	-1
I bought this to complete my Unisaw workstation - I have a small shop and it seemed like the perfect solution for long rip cuts . If I had the space to spare I 'd build large island around the saw and have support at all sides . Alas , I do not.SO : Like I said , this appeared to be the perfect solution . And in theory it is . But my actual experience was miles away from perfect.I have a Delta Unisaw 3 HP right tilt 36-815 . It is configured with the dust port on the R hand side and the back has the keyhole slots and holes predrilled to accept this accessory . I assumed this would be a simple matter of carefully following the instructions and I 'd be up and running in a few hours tops.FIRST PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : When I went to bolt on the horizontal supports to the back of the saw cabinet the immovable cast-iron trunnion blocked my access to the predrilled hole . I called Delta where a laconic staffer lazily informed me that he had not heard of that issue before bu I should go ahead and insert the bolt from the outside of the cabinet , counter to the provided instructions . OK , I thought- no big deal . What difference could it make ? SECOND PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : And this is a biggie . The diagonal support brackets that ( again ) fit into the predrilled keyhole slots on the saw cabinet were TOO LONG . Even when adjusted at their minimum height they forced the horizontal brackets 3/5 & # 34 ; out of line ! Another call to Delta brought me no joy as they had no record of this issue . Their suggestion was to cut the supports down . I am fortunate to have a good friend who is a welder . He shortened the diagonal support brackets by 3/5 & # 34 ; .Finally I get down to bolting the outfeed table on . It goes together nicely , but when I get to the swing-down leg I come to myTHIRD PROBLEM ENCOUNTERED : The spring pin that locks the leg in position does not fit in the predrilled hole . I ca n't explain this much better and a step-drill bit will make short work of the issue , but it seems like the fitment issues are FAR too plentiful for such a seemingly simple accessory.LASTLY- the two pieces of laminated MDF ( or is it particle board ? ) fit together with a piano hinge . The hinge does not extend the entire width of the board . My outfeed table was slightly bent up at the corner- barely noticeable but enough that a large board would catch on it and bind against the fence . Dangerous ! I went and bought some 3 & # 34 ; low-profile hinges at the hardware store and used them to join the outfeed table to the other piece of MDF and it brought the two of them in line.All told , this was a miserable experience that cost me time and ( had my welder friend not been so generous ) money . One would think that a Delta-made product that claims to fit a Delta-made saw ( the Unisaw in particular ) would be an obvious choice . As it stands this nearly drove me to drink and made me sad and if I knew the name and address of the individual in charge of Delta Quality Control I would TP his lawn .	-1
I 'm in the market for a new drill press -- and thought I 'd toss in this mortising attachment for good measure . The product description lists five Delta drill presses that work with the Delta 17-924 mortising attachment . None of those models is currently available for sale through Amazon . The reviews indicate that the product works with other drill presses too , but how is one to know ? Looks like Delta needs to do a little updating here . ( One star for `` nice try . '' )	-1
I 've been using this attachment for a couple of years now . I recommend it only if you can not afford a bench top mortiser.First , attaching the fence to my 16 1/2 '' Delta drill press is not easy at all . In fact , it 's a real pain in the keester . You would think this would be easy because it is a Delta drill press but it isn't.Second , the workpiece holddowns are cheap and difficult to work with . No matter what you do , the workpiece moves when you do n't want it to move , or it stays put when you want it to move . It 's not a good design.Third , the chisels do not drill perfectly square holes . The auger bits are just a hair bigger than the chisels . So , you end up with a circle with square corners . This effect is more pronounced the bigger the chisel/bit.I finally ditched the table accessories and built my own table jig ( which works surprisingly well and looks cool too ) . This solved the first two issues . If it is really important to have perfectly square mortises , I cut them by hand . This solves the final issue . ( Note : the mortises are OK for most joinery because you have a shoulder on the tenon to hide the slightly out of square mortise . ) UPDATE I was hanging out at Woodcraft last Saturday and this guy walks in ... to return an auger bit . The pointy tip on the bit was not on the same axis as the drill bit . He rotated the bit and I looked at the pointy thing , and it was tracking a circle 3/32 '' in diameter . That explains why the drll wo n't drill a square hole .	-1
This item worked as advertised -- converting my benchtop drillpress into a mortiser in about 10 minutes . Though it 's tough to get square and set , once you do it does n't move much . The parts are all solidly made and the fit and finish is just fine . Comes with a nice assortment of bits too . I will say that the chisels `` cooked '' ( turned blue ) pretty quick , but that may have been my own mistake.The only problem is that the whole thing is a bad idea . There are lots of reviews out there that talk about the convenience of this type of unit , but there are a few GREAT discussions about what a dupe it is . Notably , [ ... ] covered this device with an accurate review.This item is no substitute for a benchtop mortiser , but a good plunge router or a drill/chisel is ! A benchtop mortiser is supposed to save you time and give you better quality . I 'd argue that the time spent setting this thing up ( and taking it back down ) , could be better spent either building a jig for router cut mortises or cutting them `` manually '' using a drill and chisel . The quality of the cuts it makes is so-so , meaning you have to tune them by hand anyway . So , on both the convenience and quality front it falls short.When you consider the cost , it 's a no brainer . For what you 'd spent on this tool , you 're half way to a SUPER plunge router -- or a `` real '' benchtop mortiser -- and all the way to a good used or refurbished one . The router 's more versatile , so the money you spend gets you a lot more . I 'd definitely recommend a harbor freight mortiser over this unit.So ... it does what it 's supposed to do -- pretty well in fact . To me though , the whole idea is a bad one , and your money is better spent on another tool that will give you better quality mortises and a lot more capability .	-1
Overall , I wish that I had applied the purchase price of this drill press attachment to the purchase of a stand-alone mortising machine.When mine arrived I was disappointed with the fit and finish . The unit that holds the work piece is made from cast iron . Unfortunately , only one face had been machined smooth . The supplied bolts would not slide the length of the slots in the cast iron work piece holder . I took the unit to my local machine shop to have work piece holder re-machined . That added almost $ 50.00 to the purchase price . The photo of the product shows a nicely painted assembly - mine was unpainted cast iron.In use I needed almost every C-clamp I owned to hold it firmly to my drill press - in addition to the supplied hold down hardware . Aligning the cutter to be square with the edge of the work piece is almost impossible .	-1
The build quality of this unit is very good , however the design leaves a bit to be desired . There are a number of negatives and annoyances which leave me wishing I had bought one of the other brands.There 's no dust collection port . That seems silly , and I kick myself for not having noticed that before buying it . I thought something this expensive should have that basic feature.You ca n't open the saw cabinet once this is installed . Being that this is made by Delta , you 'd think they would have noticed that problem and prevented it.No provision for the switch cabling . They give you a place to mount the switch in a convenient location , but no good way to route the wires . I drilled the tube myself and ran them through.The add-on `` kit '' to use this with a Biesemeyer fence is just a flat piece of metal , and it 's too soft/thin so it flexes and fails to support everything properly . The price is ludicrous for what you get . You 're much better off buying a piece of angle iron and drilling it yourself.Overall , for the expensive price of this , I expected much more . The Biesemeyer guard is much better designed and has dust collection . It may not have the remote switch , but I 'd rather have DC and be able to open my saw cabinet . I 'd take any of the others instead of this one .	-1
I purchased this for my jointer , but after setting all the pieces together on my bench , I realized the smallest width it could be was 16 '' . My jointer measures 12 '' . I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on . I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace . As with the other reviewers , It 's sloppy with the 1 1/2 '' boards . The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop . They tell you to drill 7/16 '' holes and that is way to big . For those of you that do n't have a drill press , you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides . This will give you a more accurate hole . I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base .	-1
I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base . I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard . I 've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools . The foot actuated operation is nice ( although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical ) but in my small shop , I need all the real estate I can get . I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it . The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use . It 's less convenient than a foot lever , but it works well .	-1
I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws . I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw . The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of . However , I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw . I will probably take this and use it on some other machine . So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw , jointer , or planer .	-1
I have urgently replaced this base ( suppose to be mobile base ) by HTC2000 . Absolutely no contest . Wheels are too small to keep equipment parallel to the floor surface . In addition , it is not as sturdy as HTC2000 ; is more expensive and is more cumbersome .	-1
My friend bought this from Amazon and loved the saw ... Only thing he complained about was Amazon charged him Shipping cost.. which used to be free.I would recommend buying at local stores instead of Amazon as beauty of Buying from Amazon is Gone ! ! ! .. they now charge a Shipping fee ... Checkout local stores and compare how much you will save before buying from Amazon .	-1
I have owned and have regularly used this saw for over three years . As others have pointed out it is almost impossible to get 100 percent accurate cuts from this saw . Tightening the lock down knob does push the blade out of alignment . The only thing you can do to improve this is to not over tighten the knob , but keeping the blade from shifting is still problematic . There is also some play in the blade which allows it to deflect slightly from the work piece , no matter how expensive or stiff a blade you use ( worse when cutting hardwoods ) . But I 've discovered that miter saws by their nature are n't accurate enough for fine work . To get extremely accurate crosscuts you need to use an accurately tuned table saw .	-1
I did get this thing to work , but barely.1 ) The centering pin is too short , so that only the tip reaches the workpiece . This means that if you drill the recommended size pilot hole , you get a very sloppy fit . Even with a smaller hole , you have to hold down the point quite firmly , bending the metal arm . I 'll be using a 3/32 or smaller hole , rather than the recommended 13/64.2 ) The scale does n't make sense . Cutting a 140mm hole , the 170mm mark was centered on the blade . The 140mm mark was n't aligned with anything in particular.3 ) It just does n't have the solid quality of the Bosch power tools I have bought recently.Tip : Cut very slowly , and you can get a good circle . The manual mentions cutting slowly , but the required speed is slower than I would have guessed . It works fine once you find the right pace , but practice on a scrap !	-1
It 's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I 'd say that 's fine . But it 's got Bosch 's name on it and cost more than a few dollars . Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard . All in all , a disappointemnt . I really should 've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that 's usually not a good sign . Doh ! ! The description also does n't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches .	-1
I brought the new 1618EVS to the job and after routing D pine for all togeather maybe 3 hrs . ( NOT continuous running time ) I smoked the motor . After a long conversation with the authorized tool service center I sent it in for a complete motor rebuild . They assured me it would come back assembled to tighter specs . than what it was manufactured at . I was skeptical that it would be returned to me in any decent workable condition yet two years later I 'm still milling trim with it . However I 'm still waiting for that day , in the middle of some job , where it will start spewing smoke out of the motor housing again.I do like the soft start and constant RPM features.The D-handle is very comfortable , and I find it helps to keep me accurate.I have to agree with the other reviewers that it 's too difficult to remove the motor from the base . I do the router dance - I clamp the router between my knees and twist the motor away from the base with all I got to seperate the two pieces . Ugghh ! ! Wayyy too cavemanish.There is a plunge base available for this motor yet I 'm hesitant to buy it because the power cord coming out of the motor is only 5-6 inches long ( it plugs into the top of the D-handle ) . That means the power cord will connect to the extension cord right at the router base . That ca n't be practical.I do n't really know what else is out there for the same price . This router maybe an OK value for the $ .	-1
While it is pretty light , this model just has too many design issues to be worth the premium lifestyle brand price.For starters , the dust bag is awful and the sander would be better off without it . There is absolutely nothing on either the dust port or the bag itself that is capable of creating a seal , so you invariably end up with a steady stream of dust shooting right into your face no matter how much you tighten that little screw . Odds are good that port 's going to clog up on you in a big hurry , too.Next up is the tension release lever -- it 's plastic . Not that ultra sturdy kind of plastic they make milk crates and flight cases out of that lasts forever , but the cheap kind that goes brittle as it outgasses . In this price range , I expect to get a tool that 's going to last several years , but this is one part that is very obviously going to break much sooner than that . Frankly , it feels like it 's going to snap off every time you use it.Then there 's the little graphite pad they put over the platen . This wears down very , very quickly and you 're going to have to special order replacements . What 's worse is that 3 '' belts do n't quite cover the entire thing , so after about 10 minutes worth of usage you 'll have worn a groove into it that leaves you with a 1/8 '' strip on the side sitting flush with the belt itself . Can you say ugly black streaks everywhere ? I knew that you could.Lastly , the handle bugged me . There 's no good way to pick this thing up ( or set it down ) without accidentally bumping the trigger . I have no doubt that this would have eventually resulted in something very bad happening had I decided to keep it.If it were maybe half the current price , I 'd consider it a viable contender as I do like the weight , the flat platen , and the flat top , but I 'm going to have to go with the Makita on this one . If plastic and `` good enough '' performance are your cup of tea , Ryobi 's even cheaper .	-1
This product is almost exactly the same as the Ryobi BE231 it replaced , Externally the primary difference is a carbon pad to reduce frction on the Bosch . The Bosch cost twice as much , and became nonfunctioinal after little use , while the Ryobi model withstood heavy use for years . There was so much friction on the carbon pad , that it heated up painfully . The sander started breaking belts for no apparent reason . The dust collection on the Ryobi was not good , but it was totally nonfunctional on the Bosch.I have been satisfied with the Bosch routers ( 1613,1617 ) , but their sanders , both belt and ROS , have not worked well for me .	-1
Sure , Swiss sourced , German design , Bosch Name ... ... ALL FAILThe world of tool use is a jungle , and this sander dies quick.The belt release lever is of molded PLASTIC that weakens with stress cycles and breaks off ... ..no matter how you baby it ... .The thing is not fit for it 's intended useAn expensive shadow of a sander	-1
I 've had some problems with my unit . First , though , the good side ... I 've been using this since July , 2006 , which has given me enough experience with the machine to write a credible review . The unit is powerful , without being unmanageable . It 's light enough to be able to use on vertical surfaces and runs relatively cool and quietly ... although I found that a set of noise canceling headphones helps tremendously to reduce the racket . It also was designed with a nice flat top , so the sander can be turned upside down and used to ( carefully ! ) hand sand small parts and sharpen some tools.Now , the not so good stuff ... The tracking control on my unit has to be adjusted all the way over to one side to prevent the belt from working it 's way off the two pulleys . Even at that point , where the knob ca n't turn any more , the belt runs at a ~5 degree angle to the chassis.The graphite wear pad does indeed wear . Quickly . I go through one for every five or six belts . This may be normal or due to the mistracking ... I 'd be in a better position to evaluate if I had one that tracked correctly for comparison.I 've had problems with sanding dust plugging the insides of the sander ; once to the point that I had to completely dissemble it to clean it out . The optional Bosch exhaust hose ( VAC001 ) that connects the sander to a Shop-Vac is made out of very thin ridged plastic and does n't pass enough air through it to keep the Shop-Vac 's motor from revving up and whining . Active exhaust certainly helps clear the sanding dust , but , without sufficient cooling air , I 'm concerned about the impact on my Shop-Vac 's motor life.All in all , I 'm rating this sander as three stars . I 'd be happier if the local Bosch repair shop told me that the tracking was abnormal , but they said that it was ok ...	-1
This drill 's trigger takes up 3/4 of the handle and when the drill binds up while drilling , your first reaction is to take your finger off the trigger . Too bad you got ta take three fingers off of the trigger on this particular model ! This means that your trying to fight the torque with only your pinky and thumb gripping the handle ! Great power but not worth a jammed wrist . I 'm staying with Milwaukee brand , just not this model .	-1
Made Communist ChinaThis tool is probably okay for the do-it-yourselfer . However , if you are earning a living with your tools stick with American or German or Japanese manufactured tools.I found that the side grip requires the use of the extension bar . In simple low torque drilling applications the side handle can not be used without the extension . this makes drilling in close quarters more difficult.Milwaukee once had a great reputation for American-made quality . Unfortunately they have gone the cheap route , and have succeeded .	-1
I 'm a contractor who demands a lot from my tools . I 've owned the Makita LS1013 for 3+ years and am in the market for a new saw . I really liked the saw 's features when I first purchased it , but I had to bring it in to a Makita repair shop within the first year . Ever since it has been on the road to ruin . I 've had it worked on five times having had the miter locking mechanism replaced twice , the safety switch replaced twice ( it falls out and gets lost - I now have a screw in its place ) , the fence replaced once ( now needing its second replacement ) , switch replaced ; miter bearing track under the table replaced twice ( again the aluminum against steel thing ) ; etc ... .Positives of the saw : Tilted Motor ( convenient & amp ; powerful ) , self cleaning sliders , wide base.Negatives : Miter locking mechanism is a threaded steel rod going into aluminum housing which quickly strips ( I 'm on # 3 ) ; aluminum fence warps ( I 'm on # 2 and now need # 3 - I think this is due to seasonal temperature changes it experiences in the back of my pick-up truck ) ; rear bevel lock requires clearance deeper than the table ; slop in the miter angle detents ( they wear out ) .I would recommend this saw to cabinetmakers , picture framers and those who have a shop set-up . For people like me who need a saw to hold up from job-site to job-site , this is n't your saw . Beware of too many features and too much aluminum , it just means there is more to go wrong . I 'd gladly trade in the weight of a cast iron base and fence saw like they used to make because they hold up . For now , I 'm going back to the Hitachi ( not the version with the laser ) .Keep in mind , power tools made today are priced low because they are considered disposable . I suppose 3 years of everyday use might be considered a decent life span against the money it has allowed me to make . Still , I 'd prefer fewer features for longevity and toughness .	-1
I may have got a lemon . This saw burns wood on any type of cut . Replaced the blade with a Forrest Chopmaster but had same results . Something is terribly wrong with this saw .	-1
I have a number of other Makita tools , and have always held Makita in pretty high regard . My 7 1/4 '' circular saw works great , as does my motorized hand planer , Reciprocating saw , and my plunge router is awsome . This machine seems more like a toy that a quality piece of machinery . I was surprised to see a little bit of play when the saw was moved into one of the 45 notches . I could pretty easily move it one degrees side to side , unless it was absolutely locked down , and then it was not consistent about being locked down in the same place . When I got the left-hand miter perfect at 45 I could not get the right hand side at 45 , and this is a real problem as they share the same fence . I 'm not sure if the notch was machined in the wrong spot or what , but it 's impossible to cut perfect mitered corners this way.On the positive note , the dust collection work much better than some other saws I 've owned , and I like the supplied hold-down clamp . I also own an inexpensive Ryobi 10 inch miter saw , and at $ 89 it 's twice to machine this is . Heavier metal , and locks down positive -- perfect miters . I 'm going to go buy another after my experience with this.Makita really disappointed me with this one . I 'm packing it up today and sending it back . I 'm actually really puzzled how this saw got such great reviews , as I am normally in agreement with the majority of people . Maybe I just got lemon ?	-1
This saw used to be the end-all in portable table saws . It 's still as tough as they come , but Makita has done little to improve it 's features in the twenty years I 've been working . It is lightweight , but the fence and sliding angle guide are highly inaccurate . If you buy this saw , I recommend purchasing the Rousseau table with it to ensure an accurate fence , outfeed and extension tables . Unfortunately , the cost of both table and saw exceed that of buying a truly good job-site table saw such as the Bosch , DeWalt or Porter Cable . I 'm really surprised , too , because Makita offers ( in my opinion ) the best 10 & quot ; sliding compound miter saw on the market . If all you 're doing is framing , buy the Makita .	-1
I got this saw as a gift when I moved into my new house . I did n't know much about table saws then . I noticed that I was getting some binding and burning - even after squaring the stock fence . I read some reviews and , unfortunately , plunked down another $ 300 for the Rosseau table.So it 's true - the stock fence is poor . After getting the Rosseau I had the same problems with inaccuracy , although it had improved . Getting a better fence and squaring it properly resolved the burnout and binding . Then I bought the Masterplate and Mastergauge to try to figure out where the inaccuracy was . I found out that there was runout at the arbor . There was enough runout on the arbor alone to make fine woodowrking an impossibility on this saw . The blade guard and splitter are low quality -and laborious to change out.Another problem - the positive stops ( detents ) at 90 and 45 degrees are inaccurate and , as far as I can tell , impossible to adjust . At the 90 degree positive stop on the handwheel my blade was about 5 degrees off . You can get 90 degrees by manually turning the wheel to get there ( past the set detent ) and then locking it there . The manual directs you to adjust a screw to adjust the positive detent settings at 90 and 45 degrees . Well that 's a laugh . You turn the screw counterclockwise ( which is supposed to adjust the blade angle ) and it just ... unscrews . It does nothing to the blade angle . Then if you try to manually position the blade and screw it back in to lock the blade in place it forces it back out of square . I did n't even bother trying to adjust the 45 degree stop after that fiasco . With this saw you just have to set your bevels manually.As others have said this may be quite good for rough carpentry . It is light and powerful . You can cut 4x4 ( 3.5 '' ) on it without a problem . But if you have any aspirations to do woodworking or cabinetry , forget it . You will not be able to get square cuts on long boards with any precision . I am replacing this with a Unisaw . I 'll probably sell this saw and the 2700xl for a loss.This is the first Makita tool I am giving a mediocre review to . I own the compressor , 2 routers , lithium ion set , circular saw , sliding miter saw and plate joiner . I thought they were all very well made . Perhaps this is a better tool than I am giving it credit for , but it just did n't meet my needs .	-1
I had this for my first table saw when I started woodworking . No matter how long I spent adjusting it , I could n't get the rear of the fence to lock solid , or to lock in the same place every time . VERY frustrating when you 're trying to make pieces of plywood with square corners.This is not the same caliber tool as Makita 's hand tools.It may work OK for carpenters , but compared to woodworking , they do n't need any kind of precision . For that , a good contractor saw like a Jet would be good . But do spend the money for the upgraded fence . The stock fences on those are garbage too . If you really need a lightweight , compact saw , look at the DeWalt and the Bosch .	-1
I got this sander to have the addition of a dust collection system that my made in france B & D ; had a dust collection system but I went for the $ 12 less same model without it , huge mistake .I did look at and plug in a porter cable and dewalt that were close to the same price range with much the same features and I will admit the dewalt was pretty quite .This is not how I would describe the makita with any stretch of the imagination .The sole reason I chose the makita was it was the ONLY one that sported a flat base , the others where all bowed down in the center and I did not want to sand same cups shapes into the surface of any wood project I had in process .i got mine before they added the case and I used it for the very first time after it sat in the box for two years .This has to be the loudest sander ever produced , I you want to draw everyones attention and have a small crowd of onlooker develope they will surely do so and have no trouble locating the source of the sounds produced .It also vibrates much more than the older B & D ; which was very quiet and smooth .Horrible thing really , the addition of a speed control may be the only thing that saves this sander form being banned to life stored in the box set of the back of a shelf , you could not retain a friendship if you loaned it out or gave it away .I use the old B & B ; and follow it 's movement with a vacuum hose to pick up most dust , at least you can hold onto it with one hand .I have a makita random orbital with speed control and it is a great tool but there are times where you need something to get into corners but retain your hearing at the same time .This is not a sander you would want to use to sand inside of a open ended wood box , here what you have is a vitual organic noise amplifier just to add to the roar of this makita .	-1
Review said low noise , low vibes ... .maybe they did not pack the padded gloves and ear muffs in the case . It is horrible . besides down time to load is a joke unless in the last 2 years makita come up with a better solution to the spring tabs . I shutter every time I need to sand an inside corner to something . I do not like it , never have liked it , and never will like it . If you need one go to a store or trade show and buy one that is quieter with less vibration . TRY IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT . I do not use it unless I absolutely have no choice . As for dust collection anything is better than nothing . My suggestion to avoiding the dust ... .do n't use it .	-1
This finish sander just is n't up to Makita 's standards . It works well when new , but lacks durability . Even in a non-professional setting , it just does n't last . The clamps that hold the paper can work loose and are a major pain to get back in place . The level of vibration will also increase in fairly short order . It does sand well , I just wish it was more solidly built . If you need a solid finish sander , you 're better off looking at the Porter-Cable or Dewalt models .	-1
I bought this sander two years ago . This Makita sander does a good job with final sanding chores , as long as you are outdoors or do n't care about noise and dust . The sander is loud , has poor dust collection , and comes with no vacuum port . The plastic interior frame on the dust bag broke causing the bag to occasionally fall off . For the money spent , this sander has been a disappointment .	-1
I looked at this router and bought a Makita . The Hitachi is made in Malasyia , and looked cheap compared with the Makita , which is made in the USA . I have hade such poor luck with other tools ( a Bosch drill ) made in Malasyia , that I could not see getting it . If you think you are saving $ 40 getting the Hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $ 40 less than a Makita .	-1
I boight this router after reading and hearinf some good reviews on it . I 've pwned it for a few months now but only took it out to use in the the last couple of days . I ran some roman ogee bits with 1/2 '' shanks through it and it was perfect . It chewed though the wood flawlwss without loosing speed . It is definitely a good value for money machine if you do n't mind it 's flaws which I describe below.I also like it 's hefty feel and it 's weight makes it stable when I use the router for freehand routing . The soft start feature is also great . I intend to build a router station in the future to house this green beast , but I am holding off until I find an easier way to master the art of changing bits with this time consuming system.I have 2 complaints about it.Firstly , the bit system involves holding a spring loaded sleeve ( which locks the shaft for bit change ) down and tightening the collet with a wrench using your other hand which should be free . I found it so difficult to hold the bit to the correct height ( for some specialty bit ) as well as hold the spring sleeve tightly locked so that the collet can be tightened with another hand.I also own a craftsman router witn 1 3/4 hp and it has a switch lock which frees one hand to hold down thr router or to adjust router bit height while tightening the collet . I find the craftsman so much easier to change bits.Secondly , the 1/4 '' reducer collet will NOT hold 1/4 '' shank bits down . No matter how hard I tighten the collet , my bits keep slipping out after monor cuts . I was using a dovetail bit with a dovetail jig and the bit just kept sliding further down as I cut ! I had no problems with 1/2 '' shank bits , only 1/4 '' shank bits . Hitachi should do something about redesigning it 's collet reducer to grip better .	-1
I 've waited about six months before I wrote this review and I 've put the saw through some work . The adage `` you get what pay for '' is remarkably true for this product . I purchased this at when Hitachi had a special for under three hundred . I also got a router . At the time I thought it was a good deal . Now I realize this will not be my final shop mitre saw . That says alot does n't it.The problem-this saw can not cut a 4x4 without flipping . Without modification this saw can not cut a 4x4 at all . In order to cut a 4x4 I had to permanantly take off the blade guard and bend the blade guard holder back ( it is held to the body of the saw by a small easily stripped phillips screw . If this saw could cut a 4x4 in one pass I would give it five stars because in others respects it really is solid .	-1
Setting up the rails was easy then it came to assembling the fence . That was also easy . Getting it straight and true was another issue . Not my idea of a good fence . Having to tighten down then check then redo the assembly screws to get it straight is not what i consider quality . Very good saw though . Maybe Jet should stick to that .	-1
I have a Jet band saw and I too have been dreaming about owning a fence , but aftr reading the reviews her all 36 of them I would not ever consider purchasing this attachment , You would think jet customer service would anser these customer complaints . Evidently they could care less about us customers , , so MR Jet customer surface person thatk theis and stick it where the sun do n't shine . Yes I was a John deere salesman , partsman , if I treated my customer this way we would have had to lock doors soon .	-1
This product is really a problem for both the seller and the manufacturer.I received this fence today only to find out that it does not fit my 14 '' Jet bandsaw , which was a surprise because on the side of the box it claims boldly that `` This fence fits ALL Jet 14 '' bandsaws . `` The problem is that the fence itself is about 1-1/4 '' too long for the spacing between the rails . I measured my table and it is just shy of 14 '' ( 13-3/4 '' ) . The fence , therefore , is built for a table that is 15 '' .I fixed the problem using 1 '' wooden shims on the back rail and a couple of longer 1/4 '' 20 screws that were long enough to compensate for the extra depth created by the shims.The locking system was also not working at all , but then I discovered a plastic shim in the box that had fallen off the locking tongue . I glued it on with CA glue and it 's now working as it should.In the end , after significant modifications , the fence is square , true , calibrated , functional and locks to the rail , so I 'm not going to return it because it would likely be too much bother for too little gain.But buyer beware - especially if you own a Jet bandsaw .	-1
I have this exact machine and it is up to Jet 's standards for being solid and decent quality ( I also have a Jet 14 '' Bandsaw ) . It is square , sharp , and quiet out of the box and very easy to set up.Unfortunately , in the past 3-4 years , Jet has not changed the design or features on this machine . My pet peeves are that the fence is too low ( although it has holes for attaching your own wood fence ) the hold down can not come below the fence since it is attached to the top of the fence , and finally the bottom surface of the hold down is not machined so it wo n't hold your material down flat.Delta , on the other hand , has completely upgraded their benchtop mortiser and priced it aggressively ( it was cheaper than the Jet , as is also the case here on Amazon as of this review ) . I saw them side by side over the weekend at a local retailer and spent some time comparing.Access to change bits on the Jet is adequate while it is much easier on the Delta ( one large access door vs 2 smaller doors on the Jet ) The Delta has a rack and pinion on their taller fence while the hold down goes much lower since the fence is cleared out for it . Wider heavier base . Two separate locking knobs for the fence . Nicer handle . On tool storage of extra bits . Nicer quick-knob for hold down adjustment ( long lever with adjustable stops for easier , faster locking ) If the Jet were priced a good third lower than the Delta , I might be inclined to give it three or *maybe* even four stars since I have had good experience with mine.If this review helps or if you have any questions or comments , please let me know .	-1
I recently purchased this saw , and spent the next two weeks in the most frustrating situation I have ever experienced with a power tool . I brought the saw home , carried all the very heavy components into my basement . I assembled the legs and attached the saw body and cast-iron extensions.Then , I opened the box for the rails , and found that ( 1 ) there was no hardware ; ( 2 ) no directions ; and ( 3 ) the tape was fastened on the rail crooked . I went back to the store where I bought it , and the owner told me that Jet has some problems with hardware . In fact , it seems that other customers have been returning Jet saws for this very reason . I had to wait a week for another rail set . Finally , it came in , and I took the new rail set home . But this time , I found that the hardware WAS THE WRONG SIZE ! ! ! ! Back to the store again for another rail set . I get home , and this time , I decided to take a look at the fence , just to check it out , and I find a gaping crack right along one of the solder areas . Irate , I open the rails again , just to check , and again , NO HARDWARE ! ! ! ! ! Given this kind of horrible quality control , I can not be sure that the rest of the saw is made properly . The guide rails and the fence are two things I can visually inspect . But how about the motor , the trunnions , and the gear assemblies inside ? Two smaller problems : ( 1 ) Jet only has one set of instructions for three different saws . This means that you are constantly trying to figure out how your saw is different from the pictures and the directions . Jet should spend the money to write a separate manuals ; ( 2 ) Jet advertises that their saws are & quot ; made in USA & quot ; when in fact they are assembled in Taiwan.This is all very unfortunate , since Jet has a great reputation in with its other tools . I am very surprised and disappointed in Jet for all of the above reasons.I have no faith that the saw was made correctly . As a result , I returned it to the store for a refund.Jet had better fix this problem , fast , or they will see their customer base shrink down to zero .	-1
I 've had this saw for about a year . This is the first band saw I have owned . Everything fit together nicely and have it mounted on mobile base . I also ordered the fence and 6 '' riser block . One thing important to remember on any band saw is to use the right kind of blade for the type of sawing you are doing . For example , if you are cutting curves you will probably want to use a narrower blade ( 1/4 '' or 3/8 '' ) with 12 tpi . For resawing , I use a timberwolf 1/2 '' 3 tpi blade . This blade is about $ 30 but makes resawing a pleasure . It 's gon na be a little slower cutting then a machine with a 2hp motor but then again the bandsaw is a lot less $ then a lot of the bandsaws out there . If you are a full time professional woodworker you are probably going to want something more robust , if you can afford it . However , for the basement shop ( me ) or garage shop woodworker it will work just fine . Note : I gave this saw a 5 star rating even though it only shows 2 stars .	-1
I bought this blade to upgrade the standard blade that came with my 7 1/2 '' miter saw that I bought to carry around to smaller jobs . BIG mistake.Do n't know why but this blade will not cut anything without kicking back . It will even take chunks out of 2x pine . Do n't even try it on hardwood or cabinet moulding unless you 've got a suit of armor on.It 's not the saw alignment . It 's dead on . And the saw works fine with the original blade and it even works better than this with some of my worn out framing blades from my circular saws.Saw in another review where another user had this same problem with another Freud blade . This is only the second Freud I 've purchased . I bought one for my 10 '' Radial Arm Saw thinking it might make it safer to rip with with the anti-kickback feature . WRONG ! ! ! The kickback I got with this blade dang near destroyed my guards and probably would have killed me if the guards had n't been up to snuff.I 'm beginning to think that the Freud anti-kickback `` feature '' is nothing but a dangerous sales gimmick . And I definitely wo n't be buying any more Freud blades in the near future . This one 's going back to where I got it , too .	-1
I agree with the review that you should stabilize your saw and not your blade , but at some point you are going to want a blade stabilizer . If you do a lot of crosscuts/miters on your table saw it really helps out to give you that `` shinny '' crosscut . This stabilizer is the worst that could ever have been invented . Who wants to have their blade offset approx 1/4 '' ? There are two stabilizers in the kit and I have yet to see a table saw that you can remove the original flange mounted to the arbor so you do n't warp your blade with only one stabilizer . ( The stabilizer is larger than most arbor flanges ) Freud really should have thought out this design . They make wonderful blades , but this product makes them look like idiots . You have to adjust your fence to compensate . Homemade box cutting jigs are shot . The only nice thing is that they are not as large as other blade stabilizers . I threw this one in the trash and bought the forest 5 '' blade stabilizer . Does everything I want . I can use it with my dado . Which is a Freud . DO NOT USE ONLY ONE OF THESE . That can cause serious injury or death .	-1
I 've used one of these with two blades . One is a thin kerf Freud available at HD and the other is a thick kerf DeWalt . With the thin kerf Freud I tighten the arbor nut , turn the saw on , turn the saw off , and the blade spins on the arbor . This is dangerous . With the thick kerf the arbor nut stays tight but the stabilizer is n't needed with a thick kerf blade . I 'm returning this item .	-1
Received in a perfectly clean , brand new package . Three shims had rust spots the size of dimes . Both .020 shims were cupped as if they just came off a roller . This is Freud quality ?	-1
The two outer cutters were fine , but the inner ones , the chippers , were of smaller diameter - by 0.036 inches - not even close to acceptable . I have purchased many Freud products - and have been pleased . Somehow they dropped the ball here .	-1
I have owned this dado set for 8 or 9 years . It has never cut very well , leaving rough bottoms with a lot of chip out . It got to the point that I used my router or router table for most dado operations , avoiding the Freud dado set altogether . I have owned other Freud blades for my table , miter , and skil saw . These blades have done a good job at a reasonable price , but this dado set has been very disappointing . I would not buy recommend it .	-1
I bought this a year ago , and have just recently been putting it to a lot of use . After having done several projects now , I am not all that happy with it . I bought it based on the Freud name and the price . Does it work , yes . I ca n't get flat bottom dado 's ... Every single time , my dado 's have grooving from the outer blades . This has been true with the 5 different dado widths I have cut . Bummer.. The holes in the blades are not all the same diameter , this is a minimal difference but some do n't even fit on my arbor ... Some are a bit loose ... This would probably explain the grooves left in my dado 's , and why some people have flat dado 's and some do n't ... As far as the setup chart with shims and chippers goes ... The width configurations are confusing.. This has led to a lot of time testing out shim and chipper configurations ... An example of confusing shim/stack setup is 13/32 '' and 15/32 '' have the exact same configuration , with no further explanation ... So what is the real measurement of stack A+B+C+D+S1+S2 if two measurements are given ? It would have been a lot better to get an actual cut width and ply width designation . It can be figured out , but wastes time . I have the Forrest WWII as my main blade , which has now set my standard for blades ... even with it 's high cost , it ends up being well worth it in the long run.. I would not recommend this Freud dado setup for a profesional result , and look forward to buying the Forrest dado set . The best solution to this Freud dado stack setup is to take an hour or two and cut all the dado combinations on to one piece of wood . That way you have this stick to test all of your pieces and quickly the proper stack setup for your project . It is cheap though , so if that gets you cutting dado 's , get it ! I did find much more correct dado stack setups at the Freud site . The chart I recieved with my purchase did not have the same information , so they must have figured this out and revised it online . I hope this one IS correct . [ ... ] Happy wood working !	-1
I bought this Dado set on line from a woodworking supply outlet and when i recieved it i went to install it in my Dewalt DW744 contractor table saw . My saw has a 5/8 `` arbour but European blades have a 30mm or 1-1/4 `` bore , Dewalt overcomes this by supplying an outside blade washer with a 30mm protrusion which locks into the blade bore . I had two options when i bought this Dado set , i could have bought one with a 5/8 '' bore or a 30mm bore . As all my table saw blades have a 30mm bore i assumed the Dado with the 30mm bore would fit my saw . Sadly it didn ` t , the two outside blades went on fine but when i tried to install some chippers between them they just sat down on the blade arbour . The outside blade washer ` s protrusion isn ` t long enough to support the chippers , obviously i didn ` t try to turn on the saw with this configuration . In my own defence this was my first Dado set so my knowledge of them is limited . Freud makes some assumptions with the instructions on this set , i just do n't understand how a saw with a 5/8 '' arbour can be fitted with a Dado set with a 30mm bore . I ca n't speak for other saws that are manufactured for the European market but i 'm fairly sure that they all have 5/8 '' arbours with outside blade washers with 30mm protrusions . Unless Freud are selling adaptors with a 5/8 '' bore with a 30mm outside diameter , i do n't understand why they are selling the 30mm bore Dado sets . This problem wo n't be an issue for Americans or Canadians as 5/8 '' bore tablesaw blades and Dado sets are standard in those countries.I had read the reviews of this product on Amazon and noticed that a lot of people have problems with fitting this set to their saws . I tried to install the inside blade , all the chippers and the outside blade . There just is n't enough room on the arbour , the only way i could get them to fit was to remove the inside blade washer . The inside blade washer is big , it takes up about 3/8 '' on the arbour . Dewalt might have a slimmer inside blade washer on the market . With the entire Dado set on the arbour i tried turning the set by hand and noticed that the inside blade was rubbing against the blade shield . Obviously the inside washer should not be removed , a fairly slim inside washer is a must for this Dado set on a Dewalt DW744 . I 'll have to spend money on returning the Dado set and swapping it for the set with the 5/8 '' bore . I 'm sure this is a fine Dado set once it 's compatible with your saw , Freud should include a list of compatible saws with the instructions . Colour coding the shims and chippers would be a great idea as well.I 'm updating the above , i went to my local Dewalt service centre and the technican told me that i 'd have to buy seven 30mm to 15mm reducers or send the Dado set back which would cost me nearly as much in postage as the seven reducers . I bought the reducers , this still leaves the issue of the shims being unsupported on the arbour shaft because of their 30mm bores . I 'll probably have to buy a set of shims with 15mm bores which will cost me more money . He said that Dewalt do n't have a slim inside blade washer so i 'll have to get it reduced in thickness in a machine shop if i want to get the full stack on the arbour . I 'll have to turn the outside blade washer around so that the 30mm protrusion is on the outside against the lock nut . Sounds simple enough does n't it ! I ended up sending back the dado set and had it replaced with one with a 15mm bore , i also got a refund for the seven reducers i bought . I tried to fit the entire stack on the arbour and it fitted . I had to remove the inside washer and replace it with the outside washer , the nut goes on the outside of the stack . I have yet to use the stack as i have had some problems with my table saw , i would n't be surprised if there was some wobble given that the stack is unsupported on the outside apart from the blade nut . A blade stabalizer might be a good buy , i think i might also purchase a set of Veritas slotted shims which are colour coded .	-1
The Freud JS-100A is my first biscuit joiner . I picked it because it looked well made and inexpensive . After two years , I now use biscuits for everything and am putting the Freud to heavy use . It is an increasingly annoying resident of my shop ; as of today I am in the market for a better-designed joiner.The Freud continues to work OK -- I have become used to the motor noise , which sounds like a handful of ball bearings rattling around in a coffee can . The dust collection system is its worst failing -- the chintzy plastic manifold does n't make a good seal and dust blows out the joint into your face . And when you have to remove the manifold to get the tool into a corner , you find access to the screw is blocked by the biscuit size selection dial . Oh , and dust goes right through the bag too , again right in your face if you 're bending over to see what you 're doing.The crude fence adjustment mechanism is a real pain . When you are trying to center the cut in a board , it 's just a trial and error game . Some kind of screw adjustment would be most helpful ( as in the Porter-Cable 557 I bought to replace the Freud ) .In production use , the tool seems heavy and poorly balanced . The on/off switch is awkwardly located , at least for me -- I have to turn it on and then position it for a cut ( instead of lining it up and just switching it on briefly for a quick cut . Then I have to set the tool down and turn it off . You have to wonder what they were thinking when they built this thing .	-1
I 've never panned a tool before but after receiving and using this router I have no choice but to put it down . First off I own 26 routers in a commercial woodworking business so I know a lot about routers . I believe I own one of every router available for sale in the United States except for the Bosch plunge models since I do n't like the way their plunge lock works . Bosch 's 1617 is a great fixed base router by the way . Here is what I find objectionable about the Freud 2000E.1 ) The tool has a [ bad ] base plate . It 's not flat and it 's way too thin.2 ) Removing the springs for router table use is a hassle . It can be done but it 's a lot more of an effort than taking them out of most other plunge routers . Also the screw that controls the router height ca n't be captured and locked between two nuts as it 's enclosed . When spinning a panel raising bit this is a desirable feature as both posts are locked by using this technique . The post that has the plunge lock and the post with the height adjustment screw . The ability to do this is available on both the Hitachi M12V ( a great bargain ) and the DW625 ( smoothest router on the planet ) 3 ) The router is not smooth with large bits . I believe due to excessive run out of the arbor . If you ca n't turn large bits without excessive vibration why buy a router of this size ? ... I could n't send it back to Amazon.com since I had removed the shaft lock and ground off the tabs on the bottom of the router that had previously held the shaft lock . Shaft locks incidentally [ stink ] on plunge routers because with only one wrench when a progressive collet ( like the one on the Freud ) breaks loose you 'll end up banging a plunge post with the wrench and nicking it . Once this happens no more smooth plunges for you . Using two opposing wrenches this never happens.Here 's the real deal.For the buck the M12V simply ca n't be beat if you need variable speed so that you can turn panel raising bits . If you do n't the Hitachi TR-12 is the best plunge router deal on planet earth [ and is available ] here at Amazon.com . I own four of them and beat them to death every day and they never complain . The DeWalt ( Elu ) 625 is the best plunge router period with absolutely the smoothest plunging mechanism ( critical for mortising ) but has an issue with not projecting the router bit high enough in a router table . I do n't like the Bosch plungers since I feel that the router should free float until locked not the reverse which is how Bosch does it . Makita 's plunger is way too loud ( their new fixed base is quiet so I do n't know why their plungers are so loud ) . This is the opinion of a man who uses routers every single day and I offer it without any ax to grind .	-1
Do n't use this blade in cold temperatures . I had it shatter around the arbor the first time that I used it . I have not had this experience with their other blades .	-1
This blade shattered as I was installing it the first time . I replaced it , at about three times what it 's worth , and found that it dulled quickly when cutting wood .	-1
DOES NOT FIT HARBOR FREIGHT TOOLS	-1
I bought this blade to replace the one that came with the kit . When I tried to install it the blade must have been just a little off center . As soon as I put pressure on it , the blade shattered into a dozen pieces . I have n't used the new one yet , I am afraid of breaking it too .	-1
This blade came with the FMM 250Q Multimaster I purchased . It lasted for about 2 months and then crack while I was using it to cut a thin sheet of fiberglass . Prior to that it had been primarily used to cut small pieces of wood . When I went to replace it I ended up with sticker shock . From my perspective , all of Fein 's accessories are WAY over priced . More and more I have been able to source these accessory items from third party manufacturers at more than half of Fein 's price and have found the quality to be as good , if not better than Fein 's . Even Fein distributors have started to complain about their pricing and have `` covertly '' started carrying and offering non OEM replacement options to their customers . The FMM 250Q is by far the best tool in its category . But from an accessory replacement perspective , its low priced competitors are starting and will continue to errod its market share .	-1
I purchased a Fen tool when they first came out and while the tool is a wonderful concept , and does cutting jobs that are difficult with other saws , the cost , life and durability of replacement blades is ridiculous.I quickly ran out of the blades that came with the kit because they wore out extremely fast just cutting soft wood trim . I ordered two replacements blade from Amazon and although they were very expensive , they wore out just as fast as the blades that came with the Fein tool kit.I then went to Harbor Freight and bought a fine tooth Japanese trim saw to finish the job I was doing on flooring base boards and and door jams so that I could install a new oak floor.Until Fein brings down their prices on their blades , and improves the quality of the blades , that Fein tool of mine will remain a very expensive paperweight .	-1
This did not fit my Chicago electric ( Harbor Freight ) oscillating tool . It probably would have worked well if it did .	-1
This blade shattered around the hub after two uses . I liked the design but will not purchase it again .	-1
I expected a lot more from the Fein tool , it would be one of the best tools I own but the blades are junk and expensive .	-1
As others have said , this block plane is not shipped in a form that is usable . Mine came with a very rough concave sole ( as though someone without much skill flattened it with a 10-inch 20-grit drum sander ) , the mouth was so poorly made that the blade would not descend beyond the sole , and the movable gate needed some work.Here is what I did to get a descent plane:1 ) Using a plate glass & sandpaper lap , I flattened the sole . 100 and 150 grit did the trick . Took 3 hours.2 ) With a mill file I worked the mouth so that the blade would sit down properly and protrude below the sole . This meant removing a bump and some material where the blade rests just back of the opening . The blade , because it is thin , still flexes a bit when clamped and rises up , so there is still a little work I need to do . About 30 minutes of effort ... so far . I think this is the most important modification I 've had to do.3 ) The sliding gate fore of the mouth needed some file work to smooth its trailing edge ; it appears to have been sheared . Five minutes was enough here.4 ) Honed the blade , but that is a requirement for all planes.The plane seems pretty good now . I 'm still working to find the right tension on the clamp ; too little and it moves during use , shifting the blade laterally and altering the cut ; too much and the vertical adjustment screw turns only with much force.So , as a kit for a plane , 4 stars . As a ready-to-use plane , 0 stars . I gave it the average of the two .	-1
The reviews were mixed on this item , there were more positives than negatives so I decided to give it a try . The first thing I discovered was than the plane was made in Mexico . Just like other brand name tools , Stanley has taken their manufacturing of what used to be quality tools to foreign countries . No OHSA , no EPA , no vacation , no overtime pay , no employee benefits of any kind , just long hours until you drop dead and there is always someone waiting to take your place . SHAME ON YOU STANLEY ! There are just as many Mexicans in the U.S. as there are in Mexico so they did n't have to move there . Now for the tool , ... like others who expected a little quality in the tool , I found none . I fully expected to have to lap the sole of the plane , you have to do that with any new or vintage plane . It took a good hour of lapping to get the sole reasonably flat . The blade of course had to be honed as well . Upon reassembly I discovered that the blade does NOT extent below the mouth of the tool unless the mouth adjustment is set so the mouth is fully extended . Close it up just half way and the cutter jams against the mouth . So my question to Stanley is why is there an adjustable mouth when it is totally useless ? With the mouth fully opened up you can extend the blade to take a fine shaving , provided you have flattened the sole and honed the blade . The lateral adjustment is a joke as well . I had already flattened the soul and honed the blade before discovering the flaw with the mouth so I ca n't return it . My advise is buy a good vintage plane or one of the higher end planes unless you wanted to drop $ 40.00 bucks for a paper weight .	-1
Bought it to throw into my helper 's tool bag . Definetly not for precision work . Lock is flimsy , blade is thin , takes a lot of effort to set the blade depth to just where you want it . If you want a real block plane , go Veritas or Lie Nielsen !	-1
I should have probably sent it back but thought I could turn it into something useful . It it is definately not the plane I expected , even for this price which was $ 30 when I bought it . This plane is beyond rough - there is a tremendous amount of work to do to get it even usable . The blade is misshapen , skewed , dull , and the body is rough . I 'll flatten the blade and sharpen it and flatten the sole but for the work it will take , I should have bought a Lee Valley for this one.Sept 07 - I finally got around to working on this plane . Took a little more than an hour to flatten the back of the blade ( ca n't get it completely flat ) and hone the bevel . I also lapped the sole of the body . It works slightly better now , but it 's a very crude adjustment . With more work , I could probably improve a little more , but I felt it was more work than it should have been . Patrick Leach who is arguably the authority on planes really dislikes this model too . This one works now , but definately nothing to write home about . Ca n't say I would ever reach for it other than scraping glue and frankly , I have a # 80 cabinet scraper that does a better job at that . I 'd give it away , but there is no sense frustrating someone else.June 2010 - Gave it away , with a disclaimer to the new owner .	-1
This plane is an absolute piece of junk . It came with the blade looking like it had been sharpened on a brick . I spent a half-hour honing it to a clean edge , put it back in the plane , spent ten minutes setting the gap and adjusting the blade ( it has no in-out adjustment screw , and the gap ca n't be adjusted with the blade in the plane ) , and after four passes over a maple board , the blade had nicks in it . The city of Sheffield should sue Stanley to make them take the city 's name off the package . In addition to the difficulty of setting the plane up , the blade is over a 32nd of an inch wider than the body of the plane , so you must either grind or file the blade down to match the width of the plane body , or spend ten minutes resetting the blade every time you change directions .	-1
I bought a roll of this a few years , not 100 % sure it is the same brand , but I had no issues with my previous rolls . I ordered this 80 and 220 grit rolls and both are tearing up the pad to my dewalt vibration sander . The glue seems to be a bit much .	-1

It seems as though these discs do n't last as long as the editorial sais . You 'll need to buy twice as many to get the job done . I might of got a batch from a bad lot , but I think I will stick with Norton from this point on . I am very disappointed in these discs .	-1
I bought three different grits and have used two of them . I feel the abrasive on the disk wears off to soon . They 're cheap enough but you 'll use twice as many . I expected more from a product made in Finland . The ones from Home Depot ( Norton brand I think ) last longer .	-1
This sand paper leaves a lot to be desired . If you have a lot of sanding to do you had better purchase a lot of these sanding discs . In no time it seems they are all used up and are n't doing the job . I might have got these from a bad lot , but I think I will stick with Norton .	-1
I now use exclusively 3M sandpaper after receiving a sample at a trade show , you have to use three Mirka sandpaper disc for every one 3M sandpaper disc . I used to think sandpaper was sandpaper did n't make a bit of difference who manufactured it , I was wrong .	-1
I tried out the 80 grit pad for a couple of minutes and the disk was almost used up in this time spent on my DA . The dust collection holes are placed properly and allow most of the dust to be collected in my filter bag . They work almost as well as my cheap ones from Harbor Freight , but that is n't saying really . I would not buy these again as they have such a short lifespan and the fact that I have picked up 100 sanding pads from HF recently for just $ 4 plus tax . I will update as I use more sanding disks over time .	-1
They just did n't hold up . The first time i ordered them they were fine , but the second batch just fell apart . I would recommend buying a brand name from a store like Coastal tool in West Hartford , ct. You can buy them on-line and i do n't think you will get them at a better price . In sandpaper , you get what you pay for .	-1
They fell apart . The backing separated from the sandpaper . I would n't buy them again . You should go to a good woodworking store . I recommend going on-line to Coastal Tool in West Hartford , CT. Great store , great prices and you can buy these in bulk and save a lot of money .	-1
I have been using Top-Cote for years and it works very well and produces a slippery surface that inhibits rust . Does not prevent rust if your tools get wet , but its not supposed to . I ordered a can after not being able to find it at any of my usual suppliers . Although I ordered Top-Cote and the Amazon.com order confirmation I received said I ordered Top-Cote , I was sent Glide-Cote for the same price even though Glide-Cote sold for $ 8 less per can . I was never told there was a substitution in the product being deliver and never asked if the substitution was okay . When I questioned it , I was given the run around by Hartville Tool and was eventually give a refund of $ 1.95 . I will not be ordering any product from Hartville Tool again nor any anything from Amazon that is fulfilled by Hartville Tool . While I have had good experiences when ordering from Amazon , I think Hartville Tool has a lot to learn about customer service and honesty .	-1
Fine woodworking rated this glue as the poorest woodworking glue by far . Has less than HALF the strength of Titebond 3 glue ( the best ) . I also found that it quickly dries up in the bottle .	-1
Gorilla glue might be very strong but it is not user friendly for woodworking . It has some major drawbacks . It is not water soluble so you can not wipe the excess with a wet rag ( I had to use lacquer thinner ) . It expands quite a bit which means even if you wipe the excess initially , you are still going to have it coming out of the joint . Do n't even think about using it to glue anything without using clamps , as the expansion of the glue will cause the parts to move . The bottle cap is cheap and it broke at the bottle when I tried to pull off the cap ( which of course glued itself to the nozzle ) .I 've gone back to conventional woodworking glues and the new ones ( tite-bond ) are very strong so there is no real advantage to Gorilla glue .	-1
... you get a piece of plastic laminate covered fiber board that does not even sit flush with the top of the table saw ( it sticks up about 1/32 '' ) . Supposedly this device is supposed to help stabilize the saw blade ( especially a thin-kerf blade ) , reduce chipping and noise . This may be true , but then it should be a standard feature that comes with the saw rather than the regular insert . I would skip this and build one yourself for a fraction of the cost .	-1
VERY LIGHT WEIGHT , almost flimsey . Save over half , buy from Harbor Freight if you must . Most all products , `` BIG HORN '' , are available from Harbor Freight at half price or less ! ! !	-1
For birthdays and other holidays my Sweetheart , kids and grandkids usually buy me woodworking tools . Even though I usually provide them with a list , occasionally things go bad.This jig is one of them . One of the legs was bent out of the box , took some creative straitening methods to get it to work at all . Finally got it assembled and working , sort of . This thing is too flimsy to be of any serious use . Does n't have enough mass to use it on large leg sections . I 'm afraid the push tab will bend . Adjusting it by eye is not a big deal , but the flimsy lock mechnism does not instill confidence in a repeatable cut . The whole thing flex 's when you push the piece thru the saw . After wasting a couple hours and a few pieces of scrap wood , I decided this jig should go back . Unfortutely it was purchased at HD , who would n't take it back , since it had been assembled and used . So on my way out the store , I tossed it in their dumpster . I 'm going to make my own out of some hardwood and brass fittings . I know I can make something a lot more useful than this . Ca n't recommend this jig , except as a model of what not to do .	-1
This is garbage ! I should have listened to the reviews on here.. It 's cheap . The build quality is bad , and it 's just not big enough for larger pieces of work . Typical crappy quality that we are seeing more and more of from guess where ... .I can not recommend this at all.-Nigel	-1
I rate this half-a-star simply because it was a 'set ' as advertised . That is the only thing the manufacturer/distributor got right . The push block and the stick can be made at home for cents . The featherboard mounting system is a total failure . There is no way you can lock the featherboard to the table slot and have it be a reliable , working accessory . I 'm amazed this set is still offered for sale . In my opinion , the loose and unreliable featherboard is quite possiblly an accident waiting to happen . Not mine . It is at the landfill .	-1
Do n't buy this set unless you ca n't get the stick and block separately . The featherboard is complete trash and should be thrown away immediately . I have n't used the stick , though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes . I do , however , use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful . There are certainly applications were it does n't work that a custom one would , but that 's always the case . I can recommend the push block , could go either way on the stick and just put the featherboard in the trash and back away . Buy the other two separetly if you want them and save [ $ $ $ ] .	-1
I knew as soon as got this that the only things that would be useful would be the push stick and block . Buy it seperately . Bench Dog makes a great featherboard that is well worth every penny . It 's what I ended up getting and have been using for three months know with absolutely no problems .	-1
I bought this blade as general purpose blade due to great reviews . To my surprise this blade was the biggest disappointment . After I installed it I noticed that a few teeth were hitting my zero clearance insert . Spinning it by hand confirmed that it had a wobble . Anyway , I made some test cuts and the quality of the cuts were average at best . So I got the measuring equipment out and found a run out of .008 & # 34 ; . No wonder it cuts rough , should through this thing away . My old Freud 50 teeth combination blade which has seen several thousand feet of hardwood has less than .002 & # 34 ; run out.Amazon offered to send another one , but I chose not to go this route because it seems Forrest has a quality control issue . I have a whole collection of saw blades , but never had one with such run out . I do n't think it was damaged in shipping , because Forrest packages well and the packaging was pristine.I am going to order a Freud Fusion as replacement . We 'll see how that one performs .	-1
I purchased this blade about 12 months back and was thrilled with it for about one month . It cut through maple and cherry ( up to 2 '' thick ) `` like butter . '' And then it was dull and prone to all the trials and tribulations of dull blades ( kick-back , etc. ) . When it was brand new it cut better than any blade I have owned but at the price it should ! At the price , it should also have retained its edge for a lot longer ( I 've had really cheap ( Skil 10 '' ) and mid-priced ( Hitachi , et al ) blades last MUCH longer and some even started off almost as sharp ) .Again , for one month of 6 day a week use it was GREAT but it dulled much too quickly - regardless of the price ( and yes , I did clean and treat the blade at the end of each day ) . So , whyh pay the price unless it comes with free sharpening and a loner blade for the time it spends `` away '' every four or five weeks.If the blade cost $ 50.00 I would rate it 3 to 3.5 stars .	-1
I used this blade for cutting pine but It did not impressed me at all . I found my Freud industrial blade ( combination ) giving more clean cuts on pine.I guess most of the reviews were for cutting pine , but most woodworkers do n't use pine as it is weak / soft wood.After using this blade for one project with pine and Redwood , I did not felt the price was worth it . Nothing impressive at all..Save your money and get Freud combination at less than half the price or go for Oldham combination blade .	-1
Spent too much for this . Had Rockler 's stiffener which is 2 - two inch discs instead of one large one . Liked it better . As noted in other reviews , this product reduces the max saw height by about 3/4 & # 34 ; to 1 & # 34 ;	-1
I see no benefit whatever . It does reduce the depth of cut from whatever your saw allows ( 3 '' + ) to 2.5 inches . For cutting hardwood with minimal burning , Forrest recommends setting the blade as high as possible . The stiffener limits it to 2.5 '' cut .	-1
I tried this for serveral applications with work stations and also for my primary purpose when i bought it originally behind my miter saw . It really is not big enough to be effective in any application ... and really thats my fault for buying it thinking 13x16 was a good size ... so think about your application before taking the plunge or end up owning it like i do and be looking for a good use ...	-1
Seems awful simple to use , but I am finding more challenges than desired . The biggest challenge is finding the right size hose to attach . Does the outlet pipe adapter have to be so large ? The hood does n't come with any hose and the outlet will swallow two or three shop vac hoses . That means buying expensive really hose from a woodshop supplier or trying to find the right adapters at the local hardware store . Why not design the hood to work with a shop-vac , the most commonly available piece of dust control equipment in the majority of home workshops ? Second , finding out how to place the hood so that it will actually collect wood dust is a constant struggle . There are no attachment points anywhere on the hood , so you have to drill your own . Trying to balance the weight of the hose and get the hood to remain close enough to the machine 's discharge stream is quite the challenge . I am sure I will eventually figure the Big Gulp out , but until then , I have to say it is not one of the favorites in my shop .	-1
This is a good quality hose and it will replace the worn out hose that came with your shop vac but there is something else to consider . Although this hose will fit into a standard shop vac the accessories that came with your shop vac such as the extension tube , crevice tool , etc . MAY NOT FIT THE OTHER END OF THIS NEW HOSE ! only Mr. Nozzles accessories or accessories that use a 1 1/2 & quot ; I.D . hose end will fit this hose , and Mr. Nozzle does not have alot of accessories to go with this hose so you may end up with a great hose but a poor nozzle etc . at the end of it .	-1
HOSE FLEXIBILITY IS GREAT . THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS WITH THE 2 NOZZLES . THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE . THE THICKNESS OF THE MATERIAL IS JUST OVER 2 LITER PLASTIC SODA BOTTLE THICKNESS . THEY ALSO DO NOT FIT WELL ONTO HOSE END . DIFFICULT TO SEAT . THEY DO NOT STAY FIXED EHH	-1
I gave away my Ridgid shop vac as soon as the Fein box arrived from Amazon.com . That was a mistake ! ! ! ! ... this vac is too delicate to use `` hard '' during my kitchen demo/remodel - and I got so frustrated with the filter and small 1-1/4 '' hose constantly clogging , I gave up and bought another Ridgid vac . I think this vac would work great for woodworking , but general construction site conditions far out tax this machine , and it 's difficult to get filters/bags ... ..	-1
I 've had this model of vacuum for 8 or 9 years , and when I decided to purchase another for my business I ordered it through amazon.It arrived in a box with ZERO protective packing . Not a bit of foam or cardboard . Not a single bubble of bubble wrap.Guess what ? It was damaged . The hose intake plastic flange was shattered . I 'm sure the return policy is great -- blah blah blah . But it 's a hassle and I really needed the product when it arrived.So great vacuum , BUT I strongly advise against using Amazon to purchase it.-Steve	-1
I purchased this design over a year ago . You have to push the hose through the opening and clamp it into place from the inside . You can fix this with sealant and pipe or like I did with duct tape which will leak . I recently found another one at Woodcraft that is made much better and has fittings that you clamp the hoses onto . Brilliant ! Save yourself a major headache and disappointment and buy the one from Woodcraft .	-1
I have used this item for over a year and I am not all that happy with it.I have a Jet 1.75hp conected to a metal trash can ( ~30 gallon ) with the separator on top.Pros : The lids does n't fit the metal can all that tight but I used some form pipe covers to wrap around the top of the can secured with heavy duty double stick tape and it fits perfect . suction wo n't let go of this top so you do n't have to worry . Once you turn the dc off , the top is easily removed to empty the can.No dust on the floorTwist intake really not an issue I have found as a problemCons : My biggest problem is that the dust fills the DC bag more than the trash can ! ! ! The whole point of this exercise is to have the reverse be true . I have adjusted the length of tubing for both the intake from the machine and the tubing connected to the dc without any difference . I do n't know if the angles are such that the dust shoots in an out at such a rate of speed that it does n't allow the larger items to drop ? If you pickup a wayward screw you are ok because that will fall , but chips from planer go right into the dc without dropping to the can . Again , it does catch some of the chips , but my dc bag is filled with chips at a faster rate than the can.My next fix is to attach an elbow on the intake side to for the chips down , but I have n't read anyone else having this problem ... FYI	-1
I wish I had seen previous reviewer 's post about Woodcraft before I bought this one . After spending an afternoon trying to rig various fittings to this thing I finally decided , no , I 'm not going to have another duct tape covered Rube Goldberg eyesore in my shop . And so now , after paying $ 9.00 shipping to get it here and $ 17.00 to send it back , I purchased the Woodcraft product and paid whatever it is they charge for shipping only to discover that the same item is now offered on Amazon with free shipping . Color me pissed .	-1
I give it a star for price as I purchased on sale at a local Woodcraft store for $ 16 . However , I will be returning it . Woodcraft 's website says this fits 2-1/2 '' shop vac hoses . Wrong . A standard 2-1/2 '' vacuum hose is too small to fit over the connector and too large to fit inside it . In fact , they are similar diameters . ONly the fact that the cyclone 's connectors are a thicker plastic than the vacuum hose , make them somewhat different diameters both inside and out . I do not want to take time to force fit or search out adapters to make the connections work . It is also true the lid fits loosely on 5-gallon buckets and you would also need to rig a way to strengthen the fit so dust did not escape and so the lid did not fall off when hoses are moved or the bucket bumped . A total dud in my opinion .	-1
The material of this hose is slightly thicker than my garbage bags . Such flimsy hose does n't belong in a wood shop . Period.You either smash it mechanically or wood chips will do that . Again , this should not be sold for dust collection , maybe it works for laundry dryers .	-1
I do n't know why I bought this , even after reading the other reviews . The logic of the quick disconnect to move from machine to machine seemed cost justified . However , the product will disconnect while in use , and even disconnect if not perfectly flat.Rather than use this product , avoid , avoid , avoid . Set your dust collection system up with & quot ; Y & quot ; or & quot ; T & quot ; fittings to each machine with blast gates to control the air flow . This hard wired system , even though it cost more , will be much better system to operate and use without hassles .	-1
I generously gave this 2 stars.I bought 1 of these because quick disconnect is a great idea , especially with my little portable dust collector and I wanted to see if this could work.I put it on my hose and tried to connect it to my Jet jointer and it just fell right off ! I pushed and twisted and it slid off again and again . Tried it on my table saw which has the dust port upside down which will actually help something fall off given the weight of the hose and gravity and it did fall off.I marched down to a local retailer that sells these and they all did the same thing on their equipment.Where these did seem to work better was connecting them to blast gates where the seemed matched to each other . They would not reasonably connect to any jointer or tablesaw outlet . I tried a half dozen different combinations.I wondered how a company can produce something that was a great idea but would n't connect to the equipment it was supposed to connect too . I thought I was using the wrong pieces or missing something . The sales people told me that some machines are different and sometimes things just work by trial and errror . That was hardly a reasonable explanation for me . I thought that all the parts from a given brand come from the same mold . I tried cross brands and they were all identical . 2 brands I worked with , Jet and Delta.So I thought that maybe I should make a pig tail to lay on the ground to plug into . That way gravity wo n't work against me in either situation.Before I wanted to waste money making pig-tail 4 & quot ; hoses I tried one idea . DUCT TAPE.I hate the idea of duct taping anything other than ducts but i did n't have anything too lose at this point.Here goes ... I wrapped one revolution of silver duct tape around the dust collection outlet of my jointer . This quick disconnect went on beautifully . I was shocked ! I think it does 2 things , It obviously increases the friction area to help make a tighter fit and it also is a different material and texture that seems to provide a better grip.2 hard . slippery plastic surfaces , the dust collector outlets from the machines are slick and tapered naturally making the attaching quick disconnect fitting want to slip slide away from each other . Seems that research and developement should have researched a bit better.I duct taped the outlet of my tablesaw as well and the fit seems fine . I believe I can enjoy quick disconnect ability now .	-1
These do n't work properly for me . After much frustration , I bought a system that has a positive locking mechanism ( & quot ; FazLok & quot ; quick disconnect fittings available from Wordworker 's Supply ) . The FazLock connectors work just fine with the PSI 4 & quot ; hose .	-1
This does not fit a standard four inch pipe you buy at your hardware store or in fact any store . Only flexable tubing . That can be really pricey getting a decent quality to hold up for an entire shop . I 'd recommend getting regular elbows locally if you do n't want to use boatload of duck tape	-1
None of this plastic fits anything I have bought in excess of $ 100 and I 'm going to go to metal at least it will fit together .	-1
I bought this hoping I could slide it onto the outside of my tablesaw dust port and attach my shop vac hose to it . Both the outside of this adapter and the outside of the tablesaw port are 4 '' . In other words it is a male to male connection . I could not find a female version.The solution I found was to get a 45 degree pvc plumbing joint for about $ 3 . I could not find any other plumbing part that fit snugly , all the others were loose . The elbow holds the reducer snugly as well as the port from the tablesaw . I epoxied the adapter to the pvc elbow . You can then tape or glue the elbow to your tablesaw port as you desire for your purposes . This method worked a lot better than spending another $ 25 on a 4 '' hose that I did not need.Here is a link to the part at home depot : [ ... ]	-1
my dust collection main tubing is 4 '' with a 5 '' hose connecting the 4 '' tube to the 6 '' dust collector inlet through reducers i reviewed before but i did not want those big diameter hoses connected to my machines so i decided to buy many of these 4 '' to 2-1/2 '' reducers so i could use my machines more easily . a must .	-1
I bought this 4 & # 34 ; to 2 1/2 & # 34 ; adapter to be able to attach a shop vac to a new band saw that has a 4 & # 34 ; outlet . This adapter is exactly the same size as the outlet , so it wo n't go inside or outside of the outlet . I will probably keep it and duct tape it in place as it I ca n't seem to find one any different . I know they exist because I got one with the chip collector on my DeWalt planer .	-1
The 4 inch end wo n't fit any of my tools . It is the same size as the tool dust collector . I am going to buy a piece of 4 '' sewer pipe to see if it will work to connect this item to my Dewalt Planer , Jet bandsaw , and delta joiner .	-1
I REVIEWED THE JET ALUMINUM GATEJet JW1142 4-Inch Aluminum BlastgateAND RECOMMEND THE PLASTIC GATE INTEADWoodstock International G1843 4 '' Plastic Blast GateWHILE I DO NOT KNOW IF THIS APPLIES TO A SHOP THAT PRODUCES `` WOOD DUST '' ONLY , MY SHOP PRODUCES METAL-SHAVINGS AND GLASS-BEAD DUST WHICH CAUSES THE ALUMINUM GATES TO JAM.I HAVE A HARD TIME MANIPULATING THE ALUMINUM GATES , WHERE AS THE PLASTIC GATES HAVE GIVEN ME RELIABLE SERVICE AND OPEN AND CLOSE SMOOTHLY .	-1
These blast gates clog and are difficult to clean . After trying to get used to them they 're going to be given away . I hate these gates . They suck .	-1
On the positive side these are inexpensive , but on the negative side you get what you pay for . I ordered 3 . They are simply two plastic plates with sliding plastic plate between . Unfortunately on two of the three I think the Chinese were running out of glue the day the made two of the 3 . The two plates which were suppose to be glued together were not and the two plates immediately separated . Looks likes they used a drop of glue the size of a dime . I was able to fix by gluing together with PVC cement . So in the end they work fine , with some assembly required .	-1
The 4 & # 34 ; connection is at right angles to the floor and should be angled . Holding and using the sweep is ackward .	-1
These plugs arrived scattered throughout the box the Kreg jig was shipped in . Their container had been crushed before it was shipped . Many of the plugs were split and the ones that were not split were too rough to use . I put these plugs where they should have been from the beginning ; in the landfill . I like the Kreg jig OK but these plugs were totally unusable . I went to Home Depot and purchased a box of plugs made by a different manufacturer . They are in excellent shape and very usable . I have made many purchases from Amazon over the years with great results almost every time . This item though was literally garbage . I suspect the reader has gathered by now that I do not recommend these plugs .	-1
When I first saw this in a local woodworking store , I thought it was a pretty nice table for the money . Not the ultimate router table , perhaps , but pretty nice . Not cheap , by any means , but not quite as expensive as some , either . Certainly a step up from the `` benchtop wonder '' I had been struggling with these past years . That was in the store . Then I ordered one for myself.Now I know why Kreg has such a fetish about gluing all of their packages shut to the point that you just about ca n't get in them . They are trying to make sure you will not find out what a nasty surprise they have in store for you until you get home , and to make sure you wreck the package ( making returns more difficult ) when you do finally open the box.First was the assembly of the stand , and the attachment of the table top . There were things I felt that they should not have left for the purchaser to do , but that was not a big deal , and it went together readily enough.But then came the `` precision fence '' . When I unpacked that box , I was just plain p*ss*d off . Instead of being assembled , and lacking only attachment to the table and perhaps a little setup , what I found was a box of parts . Not assemblies to bolt together . Just parts . Kreg does not build precision fences . Kreg sells parts kits for people who would like to build their own precision fence . Which might be okay , if they said that loud and clear in their marketing materials . But they do n't . They tell you that you are buying a fence . Not a box of bits and pieces.Then , inspired by what I had found , I opened up the box for the Kreg precision miter I had also purchased . Yes , parts . Not as bad as the fence , mind you , but still , too many un-assembled parts.Keep in mind that like most people who would buy this product , I 'm not shy about putting things together . In addition to woodworking , I do machining and metalwork , welding , carpentry , and a lot of electronics fabrication too . But it really makes me mad to have someone steal my time to increase their profit margins.But more important than the aggravation , and the lost time , is that instead of a `` precision '' device , assembled by someone with a lot of experience putting it together , and a set of jigs available to make sure everything goes together perfectly , I am going to get something put together by a guy who has never built this item before , has no training , no jigs , and no experience with the product , someone likely to make a mistake or two - me . So I am NOT getting what I paid for , not even close . And then I remember that another reviewer mentioned problems with some fragile parts , so I am wondering what that portends for the assembly process.I have n't built out the fence or the miter yet . I was so angry I stopped what I was doing to post this preliminary review . I have a lot of Kreg pocket hole stuff , and while it is a handy product , I never was thrilled with the amount of plastic involved . It was my intention to make some additional purchases from Kreg , their clamping table , and their beaded face frame system , as well as the lift for my new router table . But this has me re-thinking my commitment to Kreg as a solution provider . I ca n't imagine what kind of DIY nightmare assembling the beaded face frame system might be.I suppose I will press on with the table . And I imagine it will be just as nice as it seemed in the store . But my feeling towards Kreg has changed , and I will not be nearly so quick to buy their products in the future . Just know that if you buy this table system , you are expected to be the assembly worker before you can enjoy being the owner of this product.CAVEAT emptor .	-1
... it sure did n't work for me . In spite of having balanced the wheels and having installed and carefully aligned machined cast iron V-belt pulleys , my Delta bandsaw still had an annoying vibration . Since the belt was old and worn and had taken a bit of a set , I figured that had to be the problem . So after reading the gushing reviews here , I bought a Power Twist belt . No dice . If anything , it made the vibration worse . Since it 's still a functional drive belt , I 'll give it two stars , but it certainly fell far short of expectations .	-1
Do n't get these guides if you 're planning on using 1/8 & quot ; blades . These guides are great for resawing and heavy cutting where you 're going to use a wide blade , but you ca n't use thin blades on these guides , so you can forget making really tight turns ( as in cutting a bandsaw box or when doing tight scrolling ) . Plus , the price of these guides will leave a sore spot where your wallet used to be.These are GREAT for specialized purposes where a wide blade can be used , but for general bandsaw work in a small shop where different blade widths are used commonly , I 'd rather have a good set of cool blocks and pocket the difference in the cost !	-1
Thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the 1-1/2 hp P-C plunge router set with table . You get what you pay for . No problem with router but the table is VERY sub-standard . The fence adjustment is LOUSY . One wing nut holds each sliding fence and is almost impossible to get it square to the working surface due to the slop in the design . Too much wasted time is spent both aligning the fences to the table and to each other . The lightweight construction ( cheap ) allows the table to move around quite a bit when running material thru ... be sure to clamp/bolt it down before use . The miter slot is rough and the slide is sticky . The only minor positive is the dust chute works adequately when connected to the shop vac.In hindsight , I should have bought the router alone and looked elsewhere for a quality built piece of equipment . Now I 'm forced to use it until I can build one that is suitable .	-1
Update - 9/28/2012 - A month ago , Amazon had theBosch RA1181 Benchtop Router Tableas a Gold Box special , so I bought one . The difference is amazing . It 's like comparing an Easy-Bake oven to a Thermidor . The Bosch is solid , with absolutely no play . It has a solid , one piece , extruded aluminum fence , versus the two piece one on the Porter Cable . The top is bigger , The power switch has two sockets - one for the router and a second for a shop-vac . It has a cast aluminum router plate that 's adjustable so it 's level with the table surface . Putting it politely , it blows this out of the water in every single dimension . And since they 're roughly the same price , I see absolutely no reason to purchase this instead of the Bosch.. Here 's my original review : *******************************************************************Although usable for some things , this router table has too many flaws to be useful for precision work.- Fence : The two sections are difficult to position accurately . Tightening the knob that holds each side to the table tends to move the fence slightly . Because they are independent , it 's a pain to line them up straight , tighten them down and get the cutting depth set correctly . If the fence halves are not aligned with each other , the out-feed side is ( by definition ) either in front of , or behind the in-feed side . If it 's in front , the work catches . If it 's behind , the router bit carves a bit deeper as the work leaves the in-feed fence and creates a divot in your work.- Table : A bit of roughness in the casting surface was easily fixed with some sandpaper , but should n't have been there in the first place.- Router mounting : The router base is screwed securely to the table , not to a separate plate . The holes are obviously spaced for a Porter-Cable router ... I use an old PC 690 router . There are a number of different inside diameter metal rings ( like overgrown washers ) that fit into the circular hole in the table ... you pick the ring that best fits the bit that you 're using . The top of the rings , though , is slightly below the surface of the table without any way to adjust them . That 's not much of a problem with a long board , but try cutting an accurate tendon when the height of the table changes around the cutter.- Legs : There 's no appreciable front to back wobble , but the legs have little rigidity side-to-side . Feeding a board through the router should n't also move the table sideways by 1/2 inch . ( Each side is bolted to the table top through two posts that project slightly below the strengthening ridges on the bottom of the table top . That provides them an excellent axis for the legs to wiggle . ) Drilling a couple of holes and bolting some bar stock ( a piece of wood would work just as well ) between the bottom of the two legs helped stabilize it . This obviously is n't a problem if you clamp the entire thing down as the manual recommends , but poor design is still poor design ... you 'll notice that competing router tables all have something that connects the right-side legs with the left-side legs.In summary ... I 'm an occasional woodworker and I do n't use this router table very often , but every time I do , I wish I 'd bought something else . There are better ones available in the same price range .	-1
I frequent a woodworking supply store and look at every table they have . I 've never seen a Rousseau setup put together to compare . I just went by the reviews and the claim by the manufacturer . It sounded like a good buy as well as a good idea.Ok , I 've had this base plate for about two years . Actually , it 's my second one . I called Rousseau and told them that I think the crown is too high and I think I 'm going to have trouble . They told me to route the opening a little lower so that the edges are are a little recessed and then the crown would be parallel to the table or a bit above and it 's supposed to work great . They even sent out another plate that less of a crown.Well , it sort-of works but my stock often catches on the lip of the recessed table . You have to carefully feed the stock along the table and watch for the catch . I 've shimmed up the corners , adjusted it every with way and am just completely annoyed with the way the stock rides up the crown and across the other side.Like one of the other reviewers noted , forget precision work . You need to have a completely smooth top without added variables that make a seemingly simple process a little extra complicated.If you 're cutting plain moulding it works fine . I 've cut a ton of bead moulding and coves etc . But forget divided light and anything that has parts that need to be assembled accurately.I 've since purchased an aluminum plate that fits my 9 '' x 12 '' opening and it works wonderfully . It costs twice as much as this Rousseau but more than makes up for the trouble .	-1
I have used this plate for 2 years now and it stinks . The crown in the plate is ok ... I do n't mind that , but the snap in rings are a bear . You have to use a hammer and hit it hard to snap them in and out . Last night I was hammering them out and the whole plate shattered . Now looking at Rousseau 's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings . Being a weird sized plate means I 'm now going to have to re-build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate . Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings . Also Rousseau 's customer service is a nightmare . This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it . 3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them ... with the same stupid problem .	-1
This plate is a `` deluxe '' piece Junk ! The 1/32 '' + `` crown '' that the brilliant `` engineers '' decided to manufacture into this plate make 's any raised panel , edge , or joint forming work infuriating , and impossible to achieve accurately . It also looks very `` cheap '' , the top surface is very slippery , and it scratches easily . What initially `` caught my eye '' and made this plate appealing were the `` 2in1 '' plastic insert rings , they looked like a nice feature . They fit extremely tight though , and removal without a hammer or pry bar was not really possible unless you modified them . Needless to say , I returned it . I purchased a very nice machined 1/4 '' aluminum plate from Rockler instead that it IS flat , and has an very nice anodized coating . It works excellent ! I highly recommend that you save yourself the time and money I lost and do the same . Keep in mind that the aluminum plates also have different sized inserts you can buy or you can get a solid one that you can drill out for a custom size .	-1
The insert is as advertised but there is no sense paying for the name when the same product ( without the bubble ) can be had at Harbot Freight for 1/2 the cost . I use it but in the future I will opt for the aluminum insert + $ or the generic version - $ . The install was easy once I tossed the instructions . It works , it is well made , the inserts require a dead-blow hammer to remove and I will not purchase another .	-1
I purchased this two years ago . I actually have two of them . Part of my purchase was based on positive feedback from the postings below.Problem : This plate is NOT flat . The slight `` crown '' is enough to mess up any precision work . You can not do any type of miter work with this plate . You can forget about rail and stile doors . Just comes out sloppy and you end up wasting material ! Furthermore , the plate can sag with a `` memory '' effect over time , especially if a heavy router is left on the table.The rings are a bear to get out and do n't leave you with a lot of flexibility for the size of hole you may need.This is a mediocre product . It is relatively inexpensive , but will be wasted money if you buy this and get a flat ( e.g . al aluminum ) plate later on . Probably okay for routing that does not involve joinery or a great deal of precision .	-1
I urge you to either build your own router table or save up and buy a better one . The fence on this thing is a pain . I want precision when I play with my router and this table is anything but precise . The next bulk collection we have , thats where its going . Otherwise it was sturdy , the table face was nice , thou the screws to level the router were a pain because they kept unscrewing .	-1
I purchased this router table after reading many reviews on various products . I imagine most people completed their review prior to using it . The cabinet is beautiful , well constructed , and works well as a contractor unit . However , I needed to purchase the & # 34 ; large plate & # 34 ; in order to fit my router , and am now stuck with a plate that with poor clearance to its optional rings . The rings need to be shimmed every time you change them or your work witl catch on the plate . If I had to do it over , I would have spent the $ $ on an Incra table top/fence .	-1
I got my Bench Dog router table and I was super excited . I 've heard how great BD is and that 's why I decided on their product . First off when assembling I found that the metal piece that was used to support the router plate was manufactured wrong . They forgot to insert the bolts that allowed the leveling screws to go into the metal piece . After calling the company and sending them pictures I finally convinced them to send me a new piece . After getting this new piece I spent 30 minutes leveling the router plate . I COULD NOT level it no matter how many times I tried . I called them after putting a straight edge and I found the plastic ( or acrylic ) router plate was warped . After talking to the phone support they thought it was the plastic router plate . They sent me another one in the mail . This was covered in dirt as if it was used before . I could clean it up but even after installing it and spending at least 1 hour trying to level this darn plate it still wo n't level . I made a youtube video showing them my problem and how it tilts . They blame the screws not being level . Regardless how I adjust the bolts there is no way to get the rock out of my table . They refuse to help me any more which is REALLY disappointing . Stay away . I do n't know how one company can give such horrible support and so many defective parts . I sent them a video even showing them what I did and they still refuse to fix it . BUYER BEWARE ! ! !	-1
It 's a nice bag but no support for the bottom . I used to use it at work but not no more . If they make the bottom ridged it would be a 5 star .	-1
I have n't compared this to a lot of bags but I find it heavy and uncomfortable to want to carry those few things on a daily level ( I end up using a side bag instead ) and it 's a bit small to have a as a go-to bag for projects outside of the shop . The pockets are also too small to be helpful . I have stabbed under my fingernails a few times looking for bits , screws , pens and the like .	-1
The belt is light , padding is nice , but the buckle itself has started constantly coming unbuckled a lot on it 's own while I 'm moving around . I 've not even used it much , and the plastic in the buckle has just become very flexible/weak , and now it just unbuckles itself making the belt unusableMy advice is to get a belt buckle with prongs ( normal style tool belt ) , which would n't have this problem .	-1
Not sure why this product states a gatemouth or ridgid bottom ; the product I received has none of these features . The picture is accurate of what I received ; however , the description , and the majority of the reviews here are describing a previous/alternative version of this bag . A simple web search will reveal a photo of the actual `` gatemouth '' product ( with a hinged top ) , but i ca n't seem to find any venders on line offering that version of the bag . This is still decent bag , but probably not worth the $ 30 price tag . I 'll most likely RMA this product . Bummed ...	-1
I bought this apron and a couple others at Amazon and ended up returning all of them . On this model the neck is somewhat uncomfortable and the snap kind of cheap.I ended up going to Sears where they have either the waist double row apron and bib apron made out of heavy cotton canvas for $ 5.99 . The bib apron at Sears is all white .	-1
I am a handyman / residential contractor / woodworker . I own several Irwin QuickGrip clamps in various lengths from 10 '' to 36 '' . I use them on occasion but , because other clamps I own I perfer , the Irwins get only light use.I have found the 12 '' size is useful as an `` extra hand '' during the temporary positioning and holding of piece work . For example , the short versions are OK for holding boards down for sawing , or checking clearences in a partially constructed assembly.But , as a class , I have found these clamps to have weak clamping power . I do n't believe they can squeese much more than 40 pounds before the head slips on the smooth rail . The result is I ca n't use them for two common tasks I have : gluing , or forcing warped items into alignment prior to fastening . These Irwins are just are not strong or reliable enough for those jobs.Another minor , but troublesome , characteristic of the longer versions of these clamps is this : if you hold the clamp vertically head-down and press the release lever the jaw instantaneously drops open and the head hits the floor -- or your foot . Ouch ! So the short 12 '' size gets my luke-warm endorsement ( 3 stars ) . I would not repurchase any longer QuickQrip as there are much better clamps available for similar money .	-1
This is not an awful clamp . I have a number of them of different sizes . The one handed thing is just so important , these were the first ones I ever had with that kind of design . That said , they do n't work that well . The squeeze handle will not give you much pressure unless you have gorilla hands . They work okay new , but as they age they kind of get sticky sliding along the bar and harder to get pressure . That said , I ca n't say enough good about the Next Generation models . I 've had some of the heavy 600 lb models for a few years now and they are absolutely awesome , best clamps I own , use them daily . The ones with gray plates are the heavy models ( I have many of those ) , while the 300 lb models look to have a similar design but just a lighter bar and plastic build . Just vastly better though a bit more money . I 've not used the 300 lb-ers.These old lousy ones all seem to have big yellow jaw pads . Avoid . The nice newer ones all say Next Generation and have black outer jaw pads I believe . The heavy duty 600 lb series ones have gray covers with blue slogan , with full length parallel jaws . The 300 lb ones have blue covers with yellow print and shorter jaw pads .	-1
Hard to believe that Bessey could make anything less than a 5 star rating , but this one qualifies . It does HOLD the wood parts together , BUT it does NOT pull them together into tight contact . Good ONLY if you are using screws to pull the pieces together . Not good for gluing . Installing dowels does NOT pull the joint together.Wasted my hard earned money .	-1
The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle . It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate clamping handles to tighten separately . Their large surface area provides solid alignment , even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for larger tasks ( e.g. , over one foot per side ) .	-1
I am a former Union construction guy , and I have done some demo in my day . This hammer while easy to use is shall we say gutless , I mean this thing has no power . If you only have a little bit to do , or you 're inside , it is better then nothing but do not even begin to think that this thing packs the same punch as a pneumatic hammer . But it is easier to use and much better inside for light work	-1
I bought this drill after my old Makita was stolen . I thought it would be made in either the U.S. or Germany -- Malaysia is not in Germany . This tool is a piece of JUNK . It is loud , but does not have any power . I have since bought a Milwakee , and the Bosch sits on the shelf gathering dust . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I recently purchased the Bosch 1005VSRK drill . I have a Bosch jig saw and am very happy with it . I figured the drill would be the same quality as the jig saw . Wrong ! When I tested my new drill I found that about 50 % of the time it would start smoothly and slowly as a variable speed drill should . I found that the other 50 % of the time the drill would hesitate then suddenly start up with quite a bit of torque and the speed would be fast . There seemed to be no way of knowing which way the drill would start which is a pain if you 're trying to start a hole in a very precise place . I was very unhappy with it , and returned it right away . I then did what I should have done in the first place . I bought a Milwaukee 3/8 & quot ; Magnum variable speed drill . I am extremely pleased with it.In regard to the Bosch drill I 've learned that this unit is made in Malaysia , and it does n't seem to be up to Bosch standards . When it comes to this tool you better pass this dog up .	-1
It surprised me that my new Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw did n't come with a rip fence . I mean , every carpenter needs this essential accessory . But I guess this all goes to achieving the right price point to be competitive . So I ordered the only rip fence Milwaukee offers for this saw . The calibration markings are pretty good , it is strong enough , and the range of extension ( how large a rip you can make ) is about average . The annoying thing is that it doens't fit very well . When you tighten the thumb screw to secure it in position for a specific size rip , three things happen . The action of the thumb screw against the calibrated shaft causes the adjustment to change slightly as you tighten it , so you always have to double check visually and do a check-cut before starting the rip . Most carpenters will do this as a matter of course . But the thumb screw also leaves little dimples in the shaft that make repeated adjustments of the same or similar size somewhat difficult because the tip of the thumb screw tries to home in on previous dimples . And third , the calibrated shaft cocks slightly , so the guide ( that short part of the `` T '' that rides against the wood ) is n't level , but at an angle of about ten to fifteen degrees . Depending on how you support the work piece , this angled guide can get caught and trip up your cut . The circular saw itself is such a fine piece of equipment that this misfitting accessory is very disappointing . Milwaukee ought to fix this ; it ai n't rocket science . Nonetheless , with a lot of care , you can make it work .	-1
This is THE recip saw , from the inventors of the tool , look at all the reviews on here . So why have I burnt 2 up in a year , and I 'm just a weekend warrior ? While it was working , it was sweet : cuts well ( a comment about orbital action , I was told by support that it only takes effect with the pressure of being pushed into the cut , but I did n't notice any difference in cutting speed ) , toolless blade change , toolless shoe adjustment , anti-vibrating thingy , detachable power cord ( by the way , this is standard Milwaukee , I have a right angle drill and a grinder from them , makes it easy to replace if you ever cut through it , I wish more tool makers would do this ) and it just feels nice in your hands . What I 've got now is the blade does n't move at all and it makes a loud whirrr sound , I think it 's the clutch ( someone , somewhere told me that it has this to protect the gears , frankly I do n't think you could possibly hurt the gears , but on my dime to ship is a clutch cheaper for their service dept . to replace ? ) . Another possible cuplrit is the orbital action , for this reason you might consider the 10amp from Milwaukee which does n't have this 'feature ' , one less thing to break . Since this has happened to me twice ( the first time it was right out of the box , so I figured I got a lemon ) I came here to shop for a new saw and decided to see if this has happened to anybody else , but I guess not ( how could this be ? I was only making plunge cuts into solid logs ... ) Well I 'm off to shop for a new saw .	-1
Pros : o small size . In it 's minimal configuration - with the thumb rest removed - it is 5-1/2 '' tall , 1 '' wide , and 1-1/4 '' deep . With a bit installed it is still only 1-3/4 '' deep.o all metal construction.o magnetic bit holder grips bits securely.o customer support is responsive ( less than 2 minutes waiting on telephone ) and friendly.Cons : o reliability / build-quality issues . The item I purchased was defective ( see notes below ) .o it takes two hands to use this attachment , one to hold the screwdriver and one to hold the tool . Compare this to a lightweight angle drill/driver which takes just one hand . For the most part , this makes the tool useful only in very tight situations where an angle drill will not fit.Notes : The item I received is defective . The bit spins freely in both directions under no load , but does n't run in reverse ( counter-clockwise ) under even light pressure ( ie attempting to remove a # 8-1 '' wood screw ) . It does work fine running clockwise , driving the same screw into a wood block.The helpful person I spoke with at customer service said he suspected that a tooth was broken . He advised me to return the item and purchase the heavier duty 49-22-8510 . I 'm not sure if I 'll do that since that item is somewhat larger ( 2 '' deep ) making it less useful for tight spaces . Also , I own many tools ( Makita , Bosch , Dewalt , etc ) and it is extremely rare to get one that is broken right out of the box . Since this is my first Milwaukee tool , it makes me leery of the quality of this brand .	-1
I know people want product reviews , but I feel that this customer service issue is valid . The clamp works OK although the rotating handle is too short and manually pulling the strap out is n't as easy as it should be . Overall I give the clamp 4.5 stars because it does everything it should.I got this clamp on Saturday July 23rd . After opening the package I noticed that one of the corner clamps was missing it 's adjustable feet . There are two triangular `` feet '' that are missing from the corner brace . The other three were fine . I called Bessey customer service on Monday ( 25th ) morning when they opened . I asked the woman I talked to if I should send the clamp back to Amazon or if she could ship an extra corner piece to me . She said she had one on her desk and she 'd ship it out to me . I wrote an email to customer service on Monday August 8th stating that I have n't received the piece . The same day I got a reply that it was put in the mail and I should receive it by the end of the week . On Thursday August 18th I wrote back to confirm that the piece was sent to my address . The next day I was told it was sent via regular mail so there was no way to track it but they 'd send another one to my listed address . It is now August 25th , one month after calling Bessey customer service and I have not received the piece . I will ultimately be forced to buy the 6-pack of corner braces just to get the one I want.I 'm glad I bought Jet parallel clamps and Jorgensen bar and pipe clamps . *EDIT* I finally got the piece after several communications with Bessey and several people 's email addresses . More than a month later I was able to use my product . My advise is to ask Amazon to ship you a new one if you have the same problem . Dealing with Amazon 's returns is very easy .	-1
I have used several types of band clamps over the years . They all get the job done but the Bessey clamp does it faster and easier . A little pricy for the occasional user , but worth it if it you have a need often for a band clamp . You will probably want at least two.Joe Seidel	-1
I have tried to use this strap clamp on multiple projects and have not had any success . It 's either I do n't have 8 hands to hold everything and tighten it at the same time or it is beyond my knowledge base to operate . About the only thing it was good for was a miter cut box top or picture frame , something that can rest flat and that the plastic corners can lay on the bench top and tighten evenly . If its even a little off the plastic corners slip off the corner by rolling over the top or under the bottom . It 's like the moon and stars all have to align before I can get it to work as intended . I would not purchase this product again.Pat	-1
It works as intended . It works when you get it on ... . therein lays the core issue . Since i 'm not Octavius from Spider Man , fitting this onto a frame while tightening it is a Major Pain in the Chunk.When its on , its great . You simply wind the handle and you can squeeze that frame like the feared Kraken from Ulysses . It will creak for mercy.BUT there are design issues . The corner thingamabobs have a tendency to slip off . They do n't seem to grab the ribbon tight enough , so adjusting tension while doing the other 3 edges is an exercise in frustration . Getting the corners Just Right , then winding the large retractor a Goldilocks amount , THEN winding the red handle ... . man-o-man.Its an OK tool . It does the job , but if you are going to do this more than once , make yourself a cramping jig . You will lose less hair .	-1
Impossible to use . Need 8 arms or 2 assistants ... so fiddly . Need to ensure its & # 34 ; just tight enough & # 34 ; and then fiddle with the height , angle , etc all on top of managing the glue up itself.A decent idea , but it just does n't work .	-1
They worked fair . They arrived after I had all ready installed four cabinets.Bottom line , I was able to get a better fit with the plain old single clamps	-1
Too small if you have a 3 inch filler and the second set of claw clamps that is suppose to hold the face flat is to offset to be useful unless you are doing the simplest to frame line-ups !	-1
I bought a couple of these but so far I 've only used them for general things like clamping pieces of wood to my bench . I did n't notice any flex in the bars and they seem to hold tight.UPDATE 12/3/2013After using these clamps for a while now I 've changed my review from 5 to 2 stars . The main reason is that the bars now flex a huge amount even with light clamping pressure . The only reason that I 'm giving 2 stars is because technically they do still work but the bar bends quite a bit no matter what.I 've also had a chance to use some much older clamps of the size and model as these and those work perfectly without any flex in the bar at all . The bar is clearly much MUCH stronger on the old version.If you are considering these I would recommend the `` heavy duty '' clamps with the thicker bars .	-1
I generally do a lot of research and digging before I make a tool purchase . This has allowed me to build a collection of tools which I am extremely happy with . This clamp is the exception . I bought a pair of these based on the makers name and price . I should n't have . The & quot ; bar & quot ; on these bar clamps is flimsy . I bent one of mine the very first time I used it . I would never buy another one of these .	-1
I have several kinds of pipe clamps and these fit none of them.Make sure these will fit your clamps or they will be as useless for you as they are for me .	-1
The product description talks about the `` contact probes '' and it is described as `` pinless '' but it has two big pins that you poke into things to measure moisture , leaving holes in your drywall .	-1
Entirely misleading . This unit DOES in fact have pins . Even at that , I could n't get it to register on wood that I know was fairly green . Printing the return labels right now ...	-1
As a technology educator with more than 50 years of shop time , I can not recommend this grinder , unless smooth performance is not a criteria for you.I began by purchasing 2 DEWALT DW756 6-Inch Bench Grinders . The first one shook pronouncedly and made a metal on metal sound as it started up . Amazon customer service was very helpful and sent another the next day . Not as bad as the first , but this machine too vibrated too much..and the wheels visibly wobbled as the machine slowed . Removing the wheels in an attempt to discover the source of the vibration , I noticed that the grinding wheels had rather soft plastic inserts at their center . The Palmgren 's wheels had precisely drilled holes directly into the wheel itself , which is a standard mark of Quality in such things ! Both DeWalt 's went back to Amazon.Checked out Baldor grinders . Had one in our school shop . 30 years of problem free use with middle school kids ... . Superb quality but too costly for my budget ... .So I looked further.Then read reviews on the Palmgren 82061 . Not many reviews ... but the minor issues were asides rather than addressing any `` real '' problems.So I bought a Plamgren 82061 , and thought a small old company which makes only a few product lines , might be a better choice.When I unpacked the Palmgren and plugged it in ... ... . It ran very smoothly and the wheels had almost no wobble . No plastic inserts . Holes were accurately made in the wheel material itself ... .not plastic bushings.It also took an unexpectedly long time to slow to a stop . Good bearings , reasonably accurate machining , and a well a balanced armaturemight have something to do with this.The rest of the difference appears to be the result of better stones and cast aluminum inner wheel flanges which extend for 2 '' or so along the shaft back to the bearing area next to the `` motor '' section.DeWalt 's engineers thought that identical stamped cup washers with the inner ones resting on small shaft shoulders was a sensible approach to making a $ 100.00 class grinder.I disagree , and the folks at Palmgren demonstrate a better way ! In my estimation the Palmgren hits the sweet spot , combining good engineering , decent Chinese quality and a reasonable cost.Spend a few bucks more and experience the benefits of superior engineering.My son , who owns one of these Dewalts , was very impressed , and wished he 'd bought the Palmgren too .	-1
To their credit they sent me a new stone for free ( one extra star for customer service ) , but the unit wants to vibrate itself to death and is a pain to use because it 's hitting the material unevenly . Waste of money , wish I had n't bought it .	-1
Seems DeWalt has taken a hit in the quality control dept . I have some of their older tools that are markedly different from the build quality of their newer tools . Typical import quality here , nothing more than you 'd find at Freight by the Bay . The mounting scheme for the tool rests is comical . The rests themselves are far from square . One of the rests on mine required grinding to even fit the width of the wheel . All the metal and plastic parts are thinner and softer than DeWalt tools of old . Mounting holes in the base do n't line up . Mounting holes in the guards do n't line up . Paying more for Yellow plastic I guess .	-1
Why anybody would design an 8 & # 34 ; grinder with 5/8 & # 34 ; arbor is beyond me . Nobody sells wheels with arbor holes that small in an 8 & # 34 ; dia .	-1
I bought this based on the reviews and have had nothing but trouble . The wobble in the wheels is so overwhelming that it 's almost not usable , even after dressing the wheels . I took it apart and found that spacers on it were not true , so I ordered replacements . They were better , but the thing still has an unaaceptable wobble . I blame the design . This thing is junk .	-1
Only comes with router bit for 1/4 '' radius hinges which are virtually non-existent . Almost all hinges today are 5/8 '' radius . The 5/8 '' bit is impossible to find even on line , and as another reviewer noted , the manufacturer has no intent of making the bit available with 1/4 '' shaft . So , tool is basically useless unless you happen to be installing 1/4 '' radius hinges . Shipping back to Amazon . Guess I 'll revert to hammer and chisel . Makes me wonder what genius at the manufacturer ( DC Precision Tools ) is making the decisions ( so much for buying `` Made in USA '' ) .	-1
This corner chisel is designed well , but unfortunately it is not very well sharpened . It mashes wood fibers instead of cutting them . In the end , I went back to my flat chisel to square out the corners .	-1
It appears to be difficult to find a reasonably sharp corner chisel . The Porter Cable corner chisel is the same generic , Chinese-made corner chisel that everyone sells . Sometimes they 're sharp , sometimes they 're dull . More than likely , you 'll get one somewhere in between.Rather than gamble on getting a sharp Chinese-made corner chisel , why not buy a corner chisel that you can count on to be sharp : the Whiteside 9600 Corner Chisel ( WHITESIDE MACHINE 9600 SQUARE CORNER CHISEL W/ 3/8 SQUARE HARDENED STEEL CUTTING BLADE ) .I went through several Chinese-made corner chisels and butchered many test pieces before I discovered the Whiteside 9600 . Although it looks just like the Chinese version , the 9600 is made in the USA by Whiteside Machine Company . It 's extremely sharp , costs the same as the Chinese version , and is available on Amazon . Seems like a no-brainer .	-1
I had already written a review on this ladder system , but for some reason it was erased.It 's been almost a year since I bought my gorilla ladders ( the generic home depot version of the little giant ) & I could not be happier about it , I use my ladders day in & day out & they really perform in the same way as the little giant , those ppl who say that nothing compares to the little giant do n't know anything about ladders , the gorilla ladder is also rated 1A 300 LB and it makes for a better scaffolding base thanks to the hinges that come included with the ladder , my gorilla ladder ( Extension Height : 11'-19'Stepladder Height : 5'-9 ' ) + my extendable aluminum plank ( 8'-13 ' ) was cheaper than the little giant ! , about $ 340.00 all together , I was so satisfied with my first ladder that I bought a second one ! ( Extension height 9 feet to 15 feet , stepladder height 4 feet to 7 feet ) , I climb a ladder at least 4-5 times a day as I do home remodeling for a living , believe me I use my ladders much more often than many people here , there 's no doubt the little giant is a good ladder system I just would not pay the extra money for the same quality so save yourself some money , the shipping time & go to the home depot & get yourself a gorilla ladder you wo n't be sorry ...	-1
First , I checked littlegiantladder.com prior to ordering this ladder ( http : //www.littlegiantladder.com/little-giant/type-1a.html ) I purchased Model 26 - 10126LGW - which is marked ( Made in the USA of foreign and domestic parts . ) - I only buy `` Made in USA '' because I demand quality . I received 10126LG ( marked on the ladder ) - somewhere we lost the W. Though the part number on the box reads 10126LGW . I do n't know if that makes a difference.In any case the label on the ladder clearly says `` Proudly designed and engineered in the USA . Made in China . `` Had I known this is what I would receive I would never have purchased it . In inspecting the ladder ... .my father was a welding instructor , he worked on nuclear power plants..he trained people to work on nuclear power plants - he is a top notch professional who took pride and responsibility for the quality of his work - he can weld like art . I can see one weld on this ladder that is broken and never should have passed inspection . It 's not worth the money . I would n't even give it to someone I did n't like . I would NOT recommend it . I gave it 1 star because it would n't let me give it zero . I am ashamed of this ladder.Amazon.com however I commend - they scheduled UPS to pick up the ladder for return which they did the very next day.Still I am disappointed with Little Giant . Yes you can make ladders here in the USA with quality materials and workmanship . stokesladders.com , metallicladder.com , duosafety.com	-1
Bought two thinking would use on two ladders on 10:12 new roof . As with the other reviewers found that a pair is needed for each ladder.Good point : the wheel swivels.Otherwise : the radius of the hook is too tight and can not think that this will handle ridge vents ; the bearing material on the end of the hook ( angle iron ) is too sharp and will cut felt ; the adjustment of the bearing material is impractical - thought that if I loosened the bolt ( the nut is of the locking type so presumed this is the designer 's intention ) the angle iron would adjust to the roof , instead one end swiveled into the vertical position and gouged the roof surface ( am using the ZIP system so surface damage has to be repaired ) .What to do ? Looked beyond Amazon and bought the ACRO 11081 Roof Hook . One per ladder . None of the problems with the above . Only possible con is that the wheel does not swivel : so far not a big deal .	-1
Why would anyone spend 80 bucks on something a 2x4 and a couple of screws could handle ? The way I do it is mount a 2x4 ledger to the wall at my level line , set the cabinets on top so the 2x4 holds all the weight AND its pre-leveled so I do n't have to worry about that while lifting . Once its on the 2x4 , you can hold up a several hundred lb . run with one hand . Then a single screw up top of the cabinet run keeps it from falling off while I screw in the rest . Any way you approach it , its still a 2 person job unless its just a single cabinet.Are there any other good uses for this thing that I 'm not seeing ? I mean , I did n't buy it so I would n't know.. just looking for others input on the matter .	-1
I bought this T-jak with the intention of mounting my kitchen wall cabinets without having to get help from someone else . However , after seeing how the T-Jak worked after I received it I ended up returning it to Amazon.The orange quick-release knob that one sees in the diagram works in one of two ways . It can be used to raise or lower something on the pedestal by turning it on the treaded rod & # 8211 ; one screw thread per turn . If you tilt the knob the screw grooves disengage and you can slide the knob ( and the platform ) freely up or down the threaded rod . At the desired height you tilt the knob and reengage the screw grooves and fine-tune the height by turning the knob . ( Although this knob is rather ingenious in design , tilting the knob takes some practice . If you are not mechanically inclined , working this knob could be a problem . ) Although there is no doubt that the T-jak can be used to put up light cabinets ( and it can support up to 400 lbs . ) , I don & # 8217 ; t see how one person can lift a 50 lb cabinet onto the T-jak pedestal and then raise it to the necessary height without help from another person . After getting the cabinet to the proper height you ( or someone else ) still have to hold the cabinet against the wall ( or clamp it to an adjacent cabinet ) .The first T-jak I ordered arrived without the screw rod included . The second T-jak arrived with an extra screw rod included . Both packages were coming apart at the seams when they were delivered.Although I am a proficient do-it-yourselfer , I decided the cost of my wall cabinets justified hiring 2 professionals to put them up . One person pushed and held the cabinet up against the wall while the other person screwed them into the wall and screwed the face frames together .	-1
The handle is too short to use when rolling a 4X8 sheet of plywood . You have to bend over so much to reach it that you ca n't see forward enough to roll it . It is built solid and would be outstanding if the handle was around 7 '' longer . The small wheels limit the tool for use on flat hard surfaces . Will not roll across thick grass . If the handle was extended this would be great !	-1
I purchased these for a select grade Bruce 3/4 '' solid floor install in our home . Initially they worked OK for pulling less than straight boards into line with those already installed . They would not pull too hard , but enough to get a board into place close enough that the pneumatic stapler would do its thing . After less than 200 square feet of installation ( = light use ) , two of the straps started to fray , making use difficult at best . The cams also became less reliable , requiring fiddling around with them to work properly , and the metal portion that hooks on the tongue/groove portion started to pop off with ease , sending them clattering along the floor . In the end I ended up purchasing some no-name flooring clamps that cost much less and lasted longer ( still going , I might add ) . Twice I inquired with Bessey via email , but never heard back . Shame as the Bessey clamps of years back ( the original K-body clamps in particular ) were well made . I do not recommend these clamps and suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
Black and Decker is a vey reputable name . But this product does not live up to the brand name . The clamps are fastened with threaded screws into plastic slides that hardly hold the clamps in place , any pressure and things start falling apart.If I could return it I would , unfortunately I put it together well after the return period had expired.I ca n't imagine how this product is rated at 550-pound capacity.I would not recommend this product as a shop tool .	-1
Shame on B & D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench . AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate . I own an original and expected good quality . Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER ? Cheap metal , rough cut in places , thin cheap wood compared to the originals , an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt ( wow ! ) and handles that adjust as one . I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood , the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely . Does n't sound good to me . I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk . I will be buying a `` jawhorse '' and sell this new workmate on craigslist .	-1
My wife got me this for Christmas , which is today . First the instructions were the worst of anything I have ever seen in my life . Once I got it together , the surface is not level , the boards do not align properly . The handle part where you bolt on the last board were not even so I had to take that all apart and due to the tension on the bolts , it was a serious pain in the butt . To top it all off , when I raised the front bench to make it 90 degrees the first time , the whole orange handle mechanism completely fell off and I ca n't figure out to get it back together so anytime I want to use the handles the whole thing lifts up instead of being locked in position . I seriously feel like throwing the whole thing in the garbage !	-1
I purchased mine from Lowes . I was not impressed with it from the start . The boards that make up the top are never level with each other . They are made of some kind of Chinese bamboo plywood and two of them sag in the middle . As for clamping ... terrible . It would n't hold anything still . The metal frame is made fairly well but I found that mine was twisted and parts were not connected properly . After some tinkering I got most of the kinks out except the sagging top . Still , I wish I had returned it based on my first impression . All you are likely to use this for is a work table and it is a bad one at that . I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Like many reviewers , I once owned the original Workmate . I loved it , and eventually gave it to my son . I ordered this one with trepidation , knowing that Black and Decker has not made a quality product for several decades . This bench arrived slightly bent , even though the shipping box did not appear damaged . Several parts fell out of the box when it was opened . These were parts that were supposed to be attached at the factory . The assembly instructions were confusing , and nearly useless . The concept of the Workmate has always appealed to me . The execution of that concept in this current product is pathetic . I can not recommend the WM 425 in any way . Additional observations after a month of use : This workbench is truly a joke . It is so poorly made that I am constantly fiddling with it to get it to work right . As far as I am concerned , it is a disposable item , and that 's exactly how I intend to treat it . As soon as I finish the current auto re-upholstery project that I am using it for , I 'm going to set it out at the curb for pick-up by the local scrap metal hauler . Might as well re-cycle the steel into something more useful .	-1
I needed a workbench in a pinch as I had n't built mine yet and this received adequate reviews . After a couple months of using it , I should 've waited . Putting it together was n't too bad . The only tricky part was the the `` vise '' where it was tough to get the plastic lined up with the gear shaft . It 's hard to clamp things to it because of all the over hanging metal . You ca n't clamp things to two entire sides because something gets in the way . It seems sturdy but at certain angles it 's tippy . For example , on the box cover , there is a picture of a door being held by the table . For kicks , I tried this with a door sitting in my basement and it immediately fell over . I tried it with a 2x2 birch plywood and the same thing while it did n't fall over , a very small bit of pressure on the end ( where , for example , I 'd want to route the edge ) made it tippy . There 's no way I 'd want to do any power tool work on this as I just do n't trust it to stay stable . Nevermind getting a clean cut -- I 'm talking about cutting myself.The bench dogs work well but only for limited size pieces . I guess if you 're a model builder you 'll be OK , but anything bigger than a jewelry box will have issues with it . It 's also too small to use as a sit down bench . It has worked well as a small outfeed table for my table saw but for that I could 've just used a sawhorse . Bottom line is take the $ 90 you 'd spend on this , buy yourself some wood , and build something bigger , better , and more stable than this thing . If you do n't want to do that , buy yourself a small kitchen cabinet and screw a top onto it . You 'll have a much more stable and functional work surface .	-1
First , I got this at a deep discount , so am writing a review in context of the price that most pay . So lets start by saying that the instructions are crap . They have useless drawings and even have errors in the text . ( mislabeled parts-top block vs. front block ) Again , I had to giggle since there are only a dozen parts to put together , so it should be a cinch , right ? Well , my friend and I were laughing at first and then later we were just plain annoyed at why this should be so difficult.My friend is a process engineer and writes complex instruction manuals for a living . he could not believe that any quality control was asserted during the writing of the manual ! On to the nitty gritty : So , After we discovered that the belt-drive that makes the handles turn together was mis-aligned , we set to fixing that first . once that was done , we got all the boards on top . None of them lined up well . The cranks to tighten the work clamps are not going to last because they are cheap plastic `` snap-ons '' . The belt skips constantly , and is cheap plastic . The wood surface has numerous flaws as well . The metal frame is banged up too , despite the box being fine.Grades : Directions- D-Assembly ease- DQuality- c-Stability- BUsability- BValue- D+ ( or a B+ if you got the lightning Deal ) Overall- C-Now that being said , I just bought this to hold my miter saw . It will work fine for that purpose and the price was fine . Otherwise it is just the classic , `` made poorly in china '' junk that once reputable companies are putting out nowadays .	-1
... from what these used to be.Like most products that used to be made in the USA , Black & Decker has seen fit to manufacture the WorkMate in China . And it shows . Those of you unfortunate enough to have bought this piece of junk because you did n't know any better ... I feel your pain.I still have my old original WorkMate table ( a model 300 ) that is fast up on the quarter century mark . And it works better in every respect than the 7 year old model 425 I received as a gift . The steel on the 425 is rough edged and thin , all pivot points are pop-riveted and , after seven years of use , so tight it is still difficult to open the table . The ergonomics of the opening latches are such that you have to push down on them while trying to pull up on the table to release it ... nothing beats third world design . The larger bamboo wood table insert warped within a year . The overall fit , finish and function of this WorkMate is rough and cheap ... such a far remove from the originals . Had this not been a gift it would have been returned . I certainly would n't recommend this waste of steel to anyone.What a shame.B & D ; invented the WorkMate ( or at least brought it to market ) and it was a great tool to have for DIY 's and Pro 's alike . The fact the originals are still around and working is testament to how well they used to be made ... and made here in the USA.My advice if you want a *good* WorkMate ? Find one of the old originals in the aisles of everyone 's favorite auction site or score one from a garage or estate sale . As long as people keep buying the cheap Chinese-made junk U.S. tool manufacturers are footing ... the manufacturers will keep making cheap Chinese-made junk .	-1
I have one of the original aluminum die-cast Workmates ( made in Great Britain in the 70 's ) that had seen its better day . So I went with this `` updated '' model from Black & Decker . What a joke and an extremely poor excuse for `` progress '' . It 's mostly made of cheap stamped metal and plastic parts that make for a very rickety and unstable platform that is a mere wisp of the original Workmate . It came damaged , and I have since had to replace several plastic parts to keep it some form of working order ( such as it is ) . When I finally get some time , I am going to refurbish my old Workmate and junk this POS .	-1
Very poorly constructed . Flimsy sheet metal . Catches on the underside of the jaws do not engage securely into the holes in the frame . Adjusting screws were poorly aligned so that the first attachment of the moveable jaw left it crooked and required some disassembly and adjusting on my part . Reasonably sturdy with all 4 legs on a flat floor , but I suspect it will prove wobbly on an uneven surface . Definitely not for the serious DIYer who works with heavier items . Next time I would look for something much sturdier . Made in China .	-1
The Black & Decker Workmate 425 provides a sturdy durable working/clamping surface , however , there are several design flaws that make it less practical . The first being the instructions . They are poorly written and are in very small print . They are confusing and it took two of us a couple of hours to figure them out . We finally succeeded in putting it together without the instructions.The top working surface is cheap fiber board , not hard wood . The frame is steel but the attachments to the top are very breakable plastic parts . The top clamps are made of cheap plastic also . I do n't think the clamping pressure is suitably strong enough for holding glued surfaces tight.As a whole , considering the money spent , I do n't think that the poor quality of construction is worth the price . It 's like a glorified TV dinner tray . I would n't buy another one .	-1

Here 's a couple of things the pictures wo n't tell you:1 ) The vise handle , track and pin and quite loose and plastic . Once you install the handles on the item you ca n't take them apart again as they are held in with pins you have to hammer in.2 ) The area between the two ends on the vise planks opens only between 4-6 inches so you can only hold something thats between 4-6 inches wide3 ) The alignment on mine was off by about 1/4 '' which is a lot considering it 's supposed to double as a vise4 ) Overall I 'd say this item is not really suitable for any kind of serious work . Might be good as a kid 's play thing	-1
