They look good and stick good ! I just do n't like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating . I just wo n't buy a product like this again	1
These stickers work like the review says they do . They stick on great and they stay on the phone . They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister . : )	1
These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish ! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year ! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT ! ONE YEAR ! ! Great quality !	1
Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition . However , I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector . I never received one . Though its not a big deal , it would 've been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one .	1
awesome ! stays on , and looks great . can be used on multiple apple products . especially having nails , it helps to have an elevated key .	1
Came just as described.. It does n't come unstuck and its cute ! People ask where I got them from & it 's great when driving .	1
Good case , solid build . Protects phone all around with good access to buttons . Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day . I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm . I 'm glad that it lasts from start to end . 5/5	1
This is a fantastic case . Very stylish and protects my phone . Easy access to all buttons and features , without any loss of phone reception . But most importantly , it double power , just as promised . Great buy	1
this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I ca n't complain ! a+ recommend it to all	1
This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4 . The S4 fits very well , is slim and does n't add much weight to the Galaxy S4 . It doubles the battery life . You can charge either the battery , the phone or both . There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well . Well worth the price .	1
Performs exactly as advertised . It 's very sturdily built , and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it 's supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience . Do n't know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it .	1
Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases , PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days . It does n't heat up like most of the other ones , and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case . Before I was using the Mophie case but I could n't wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket , Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary , with PowerBear , I never take it off because I ca n't even tell the difference . Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times , its shock resistant technology wo n't let a single thing happen to the case or the phone . The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night , it charges both my phone and the case , and I have battery life for more than two days . I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job , fitness center , and throughout the community . Everybody was loving the case , and what they do n't know is that it cost me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand . This is the best purchase I 've made on the internet , and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays . THANK YOU POWERBEAR ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Just what I needed . I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons , but I also needed new replacement batteries . Now this is n't the case , since I got both in one . Awesome thanks A+	1
When there is no outlets , or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue ! Ordered one for my husband , and myself . Great purchase ! !	1
It works great . Does n't heat up like crazy like the other ones I got , and cheaper too ! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get , thats why I got one for me and my wife . I wonder why its called power bear..	1
Surprisingly , this inexpensive version works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive variety . It has been working for me for months now . No problem . Excellent value .	1
I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma ! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for very long . I bought 15 of them , because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last . I assume they will work fine . I have not been using them much . I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger . This passed and I stocked up .	1
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod . Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket . Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it .	1
just what you need , I am always having to charge my phone and then find I have another item to charge also .	1
They are nothing special for sure , but it 's nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it . able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice .	1
I have several chargers . Have more than one vehicle so I keep more than one of these in each . Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working , and you have no way to recharge your phone . That is always when you need it most . This one works well for any of my products .	1
I bought this a little skeptical . After I tried it I bought two more . It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months . If that changes I will update this review .	1
This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China . When it is charging the phone , the car radio gets LOTS of static . Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So , no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me , but if you listen to the radio , you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars .	1
Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion . And the item is just as described . Great buy if you ask me	1
This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru 's console . Passengers love it , I love it because it emits a blue glow , because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new .	1
I 've bough a munch of different things like this over the years . Most would n't stay in the jack , or would give out after a few days . This one is GREAT !	1
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone	1
It came at last , good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job	1
excellent product , works great , have easy handling , and good quality as it is announced . reached as is shown time and in very good condition thank you very much for everything	1
Purchased two and we put one in each car . Now we charge our ipad and iohone together . Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices . If you have to think about it you need counseling	1
great charger for 2 devices and i have n't had any problems so far 3yrs now	1
Purchased product about many a month ago . Pros : Loved it work just fine ! ! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter ! ! Can plug in two things at one time ... .Con : Top clear piece came off easily overtime ( I just put clear tape around the top ) TOTAL : PROS:95 % CONS:5 %	1
I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car . works for iphone but not the tablet . I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together . it 's cheap , small and compact	1
Works great . The blue led light is a nice touch in the car . We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet . Nice low profile too .	1
works great and charges ipads , tablets , smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger .	1
This charger works great and is short , unlike most chargers . It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car . Great value and easy on the wallet .	1
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go . Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go !	1
I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once ! Seems to charge quicker without GPS on , with it on , it only holds the battery , but better than it dying ! ! !	1
Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port . Works .	1
I received this product before I expected . It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone ( 3GS ) and my phone ( HTC Evo V 3D ) . It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price	1
I have several of these , from various retailers , all the same , each made in some anonymous Chinese factory , all exactly alike.They 're great . They really do work , and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do . They do the job.You would n't expect much QC for a $ 2 electrical product , but they each work just fine.They do n't last forever -- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par , then they suddenly die . So do have some replacements on hand . At this price , no problem.Yes , they work with both my iPhone and iPad . Also with every other USB device I 've needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is very helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel . If you leave one behind , hey , it 's only $ 2.I 'm totally pleased with these clever little gems . No complaints . I would n't be without a couple , especially for travel.Hope this is helpful . Happy trails , all .	1
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer	1
I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed . It works well , but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night . Overall , a very good deal .	1
I love this case ! It 's so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber . Very happy !	1
I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover . But alas , it came a day earlier than expected , and the beautiful pink product expected ! The `` rubberized '' cover feels a little greasy ( like it was armor-all 'd ) , but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking !	1
Another pretty phone case that I really love . I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks	1
The case is not white , its more of a silver . It 's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly . It took too long to arrive .	1
Defintiely worth the price ... You should order several . Most cases are $ 15 and up especially at the cell phone stores . I ca n't believe the mark up on these things !	1
This is a great case ... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time . Would recommend	1
Received this item very quickly . The design is even more vivid than expected . The cover is soft ( rubberized ) but durable . I have received many compliments . It was an excellent buy ! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a `` good look '' for their phone .	1
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new . I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone .	1
The color is more dark in person , and this isnt the best protection case . I get a lot of compliments on the case , and it was easy to put on .	1
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone .	1
The case is pretty good . It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little . Other then that i like it . Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch . Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent .	1
This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor . I bought mine from Electromaster . It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for . its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up . it looks great but its for show not for protection . if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box	1
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot .	1
Its rubberized does n't look like it in the picture but it is It 's really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes .	1
Received this in about a weeks time . Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was . It 's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it . I have n't tried to remove it yet , but hopefully it wo n't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers .	1
This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone . It is very stylish and I received many compliments	1
This is the cutest case EVER ! I love it because it was easy to apply . I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses , it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched . This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time ... WOO HOO ! !	1
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone . Use your judgement on that one .	1
very good charger , it woks fine , no complaints ! ! ! I would recommend it ! ! It was good , but not using it anymore !	1
This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised . It is a genuine Blackberry charger . It was brand new and worked perfectly . For the price , I do n't think you can ask for much more than that !	1
Great product . Use this with my Galaxy S4 . At this price I bought 2 more . One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger .	1
Honestly I have always loved this specific model , since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go . Though it does n't exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones , it works pretty well on all of them , you just need to be patient .	1
I 've had this charger well over a year now , and it still works perfectly . Most chargers would have broken by now . The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries .	1
so far no problems , it charges fast that is what i need it . it doesn ' have an USB as it specified , jus a direct wall charger .	1
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5 but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower . When this charger goes it tends to loose it 's fit firmly in usb and has a short .	1
Another very good phone charger that does the job and has a very affordable price that anyone can afford to buy it .	1
Works well . We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year . For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great . Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2 .	1
I needed a charger quick and I did n't want to spend $ 20.00 at the convenience store for a short , crappy charger . For this price , the charger is great.Pros : The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed . I do n't have to struggle to see my phone when I 'm laying down.Cons : The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about . The connecter does n't like to stay in place 100 % of the time . It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge . My phone is also old and the port is a little worn . That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price . Buy this !	1
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed . Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3 .	1
This Charger is awesome ! First of all I was n't expecting it until between 12/12 and 12/17 , but it arrived on 12/11 , So That was a plus for me ! Second , I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things ! but I figured what the heck its cheap , so what can I loose ! Well , I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4 , it charged from 80 % to 100 % in about 7 minutes ! ! Yes i timed it ! and also the cord is long which is a plus for me ! So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price , this is the one ! ! update : not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers , because I 've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it 's still going strong ! ! Love this charger especially for the length ! !	1
I purchase this for a backup at work . It charges my SGS4 . I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4 .	1
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4 . it chargers the phone fast and the price is great ! Highly Recommended product !	1
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future . money spent well ! ! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need ! !	1
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine . I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem . it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it .	1
I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend . They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am , I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I 'm happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes ( the kind you 'd normally receive in a new/refurb phone ) . Ca n't go wrong with the price and certainly ca n't argue with the benefits of OEM vs. generic ( mA output and reliability at the top of the list ! ) .	1
I bought this for my Samsung Charge . It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $ 20 Verizon charger . I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price !	1
It does what it needs to do , very pleased . I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back .	1
Charger works great . Have n't had any issues with it at all . I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I 've used , but other than that , I love it .	1
The big store that is in every town now ( ca n't say their name ) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock . If they ever have anything is stock , it is cheap junk that does not last . I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store . This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now . I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly . Since this one still works , I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out . This is a great car charger , and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store -- not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger verses their junk .	1
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot .	1
luving it right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them	1
A very good car charger for your phones , charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable , I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger .	1
Sprint wanted $ 30 fro the same item . This is OEM and not third party after market . Bought two . Work great	1
This charger works great . I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone . Great bargain .	1
Though I ` m not a expert in cell phone chargers . This thing works good , but its not all fireworks and hotel parties . Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it .	1
I used this charger for a couple of months now . Its a very good charger . It charges my phone very quickly .	1
It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3 ... recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone	1
I needed a car charger and this was very affordable and it worksgreat ! The same thing from the store was three times the price .	1
good oem car charger , i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine , I would recommend this product	1
This charger works perfectly . It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine . I highly recommend it .	1
I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk . This charger is working as expected , charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product , not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past .	1
Hope to use it soon . My other one worked sometimes . This one does not have the light on unless you are charging .	1
es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema	1
I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast ! ! ! LOVE IT , LOVE IT LOVE IT ! ! If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome .	1
I 've been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended . I would buy again . Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer , but it is of a decent length .	1
Works great nice long cord . Does the trick . Bought several of these to put in diff . rooms & one for work .	1
Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection . Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it .	1
fast delivery , works well . Not very long .	1
This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good . It works perfectly . The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone .	1
it 's a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping was n't more than the item . I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone . but great all an all	1
although i do not use the charger , the cable is useful . it is longer than what is given with the phone . the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight , instead of down by the wall receptical	1
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone . It is most definitely a good buy for the price !	1
works good with our phones , better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price	1
I have n't had any problems with it . It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2 .	1
thank you . it did not disappoint . was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently . shutting down by surprise etc ...	1
I love it . It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long . I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work .	1
I am pleased with this purchase . The detachable cable option gives very good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers . Good quality for a travel charger .	1
charges me up all the way . doubles my battery liek promised . case protects well and the color is awesome nice	1
The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it . They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it ! Great case , powers me up and VERY stylish . Matches my 5C PERFECTLY : )	1
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125 % battery . I am charged for the full day with this case .	1
Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone . Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear . Really like the name of the case as well ! ! 5 stars deff !	1
This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying . Plus the color is very beautiful .	1
Bought one for me and another for the wife . Acts as phone protector and charging case in one . Hold charge all day so no complaints .	1
This PowerBear case is a lifesaver ! ! Charges fast , always reliable . I also love the glossy texture of the case . Highly recommend ! !	1
This is a very well built and designed case , with a very cool and attractive color . Phone dies too quickly without it	1
I was surprised it game in three steps , but when i put the case together and slid my phone in , i loved it . It is hard to get off	1
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful . Good price and i recommend it .	1
Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design , it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would .	1
this is really cute phone case , i like it alot , and it came in when it stated it would too	1
Really cute but the heart does n't really show up if you have the white iPhone 4 . 3 piece case & fits like a glove , looks really cute . Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case . Do recommend .	1
Great case for my phone . Protects and keeps me charged . easy access to the button and sounds good too . i like it	1
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound . This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening .	1
Wow ! What a cute battery case ! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone ! That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white , ( since my phone is white ) , and my sister 's is black , ( since her phone is blue ) .Anyway , these little guys give you power for your phone ! If we run out juice , especially when on the go , we can just connect this case to our phone , and it is POWER ON THE GO ! ! ( I 'm just concerned about the functionality ) .	1
Great case . Doubled my battery life like promised . Ca n't beat the price . I would recommend it for a friend . A+	1
Great case , sturdy , doubles battery , wont have to worry any more . I purchased this for my kid and he is very HAPPY .	1
Bought one for me and the wife ( diff color ; phone , not wife , lol. ) . Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that ca n't always plug in to charge each day .	1
I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases , but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case ! ! What a great find ! ! 5 STARS	1
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying . the phone is great for entertainment . but battery could be better . the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment . im sold	1
This product is great . I like the kickstand on the back . The power indicator is very convenient to know charge pack status .	1
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price . I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $ 5 cheaper .	1
This is absolutely amazing , more than doubles my battery life , so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price , this is just the right deal . A++++++++	1
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping . Came in different colors to match phone . Can go entire 24 hours without charging ; but I am not a kid playing games all day long . No complaints or problems . ( Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f & % $ up )	1
Since I am always on my phone , the battery life is very short . After purchasing this battery case I am no longer worried about running out of battery life .	1
My brother just got the HTC One , and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look , fits well , does n't get overheated and saves the day every now and then ! Especially when GPS is needed !	1
The color pops out so well . Clips well to my phone and charges me up . I cant complain ! No cons !	1
The raised edges protect the screens from falls . The battery case looks stylish and charges me up . This case is fannnnntastic	1
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use . the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised	1
The S5 is a fantastic phone . However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly . With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power . Great buy .	1
Totally worth the money , It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days . BRAVO !	1
I got this case for my nephew , and he claims that it was not what he expected . He has a charge case for his last phone , and it covered the whole thing . This is just like a back of the phone replacement , so it does n't add to much weight	1
This is a really great case , looks and feels amazing , not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours .	1
I think this case is an excellent choice , since it is not so bulky , the color is nice , the texture on the back is good for gripping , and it extends battery life . It 's a life saver , and there is n't too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it . Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store . Would recommend .	1
compre este Case hace varios meses y protege el celular de manera excelente..ni siquiera tube que comprar protector de pantalla y gracias a dios mi cel este nuevo..	1
I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 ( At & t version ) . The store was selling similar cases for $ 20 and $ 35 . I just ca n't justify spending that much on a case . This case is made for the unlocked version of the Galaxy S2 . The size is the same . The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked . I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine	1
nice case , protective and good looking , it also has a nice changing texture in some areas . good buy for the price	1
Bought this for my new AT & T ; Galaxy SII , the case arrived super fast , its fits the phone perfectly and snug . I have no issues with any buttons , and the rubber is in a smooth , sort of laminated finish . It does not stick to your pockets . Overall , I am extremely happy with the purchase , especially for so cheap.And just FYI : This is for the AT & T ; ( i777 ) , or International ( i9100 ) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint , T-Mobile or the AT & T ; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones . You 've been warned .	1
I liked the case , and for the amount of money paid , its a good buy , i personally like stronger cases , this is very flexible and indeed looks like a hard case , a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there . Very Good purchase .	1
Like most of the other reviews say , this rubbery case has a smooth exterior , so it does n't feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber . While still appearing to have a hard shell , the rubber itself is fairly soft , and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky .	1
This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it.It is a high quality skin and gives a very good feeling in your hands.I recommend this product for your SGSII .	1
I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick . Lightweight and sleek .	1
I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is very shiny and soft to the touch . My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars . Well for the price i think it is ok .	1
Do n't expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Di n't Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone .	1
Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1 .	1
arrive on time , good quality , functionally , recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100 , fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone .	1
It is good , and look so cute . I like it . It is cheap than when i saw in a store .	1
I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this , its very safe , & not to bulky ! Overall very satisfied customer .	1
Very satisfied with my purchase . The quality is good and the shipping is quick . The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone . TPU ( the plastic material where the case is made of ) virtually resists oil and dust . I used to have an Otter box for my other phone . The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy . The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not . To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case . The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient ( anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out ? ) . I wish the top margin ( above the earphone ) can wrap down by a few mm . Overall I feel my phone secured in the case .	1
totally awesome , It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new !	1
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust .	1
This product arrived quickly . It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off , I have no complaints .	1
Great Grip , Great Style , Gerat Durability , Great PRICE ! Lasts long . SLIM FIT ! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5 ! Too bad HTC	1
this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable . . .	1
Well , went on the internet first ... . $ 14.00 , then to a very well known store , here in Gloucester , MA , $ 28 . I was not happy . Then , of course , I knew Amazon would come up with something ... they did , $ 4.00 and change ... it arrived promptly . I can not say enough about Amazon , they are realistic in their prices , knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire , ,for 14 or 28 dollars . I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it . Thank you again and again .	1
I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work , so I purchased this one . Nothing special as long as it is working , and it is.No complain .	1
There is a difference in USB cables . On some computers , including mine , the USB ports are underpowered , and some poor cables do not transmit data well . I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530 . This cable works great , even with my underpowered USB ports .	1
this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer . great value for the price .	1
This cable is better than original . Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection , as the original does , when plugged to PC .	1
I bought this recently and did not expect much , as it was only $ 2.99 shipped to my door . For that much money , how can you go wrong ? So , I have not used it to transfer data yet , as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging . When plugged in , my Palm Pixi prompts me , just as the factory cable does , to transfer or charge . I have used this cable about 10x to charge now , and it works great ! Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable , or two !	1
A good inexpensive cable that works like the original . I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased . After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one . While several inches shorter ( 40 '' ) than the original it works well and with the touch stone . I used this cable mainly for use in the car .	1
The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one , but I suggest purchasing the whole unit -- plug and all , not just the cable , because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price .	1
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly . I 'm glad I bought it . Thank you !	1
This charger does the trick . The charger in my car does n't work when the ignition is off , and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of vision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it , and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby . I may charge it every couple of weeks . Very convenient accessory .	1
The Motorola T505 does n't come with an AC charger , only a DC charger . This makes a great addition to the package . You can charge in your home at night .	1
I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also , but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers . So I took a chance ( due to the low price and free shipping ) and was pleasantly surprised . The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader , PDA , camera , etc. , and at less than 25 % of the cost . I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems .	1
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger . we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo . this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling . by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge . great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time .	1
It 's true ! This cable outperforms the original ! When I charge my phone , it 's chargier . The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general . If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie , people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher . If I circle my dinner plate with it , the food tastes better . Basically this cable makes everything better than the original . I 'm thinking about getting a 2nd one !	1
This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry ... but it 's a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I have n't tested it 's speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that 's all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product , that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product , this cable is 1m long .	1
I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper , but cheap is expensive .	1
I 'll never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working ... for the EXACT same phone ! I just do n't get it . I decided to try it out despite the people that said it did n't work , and I 'm glad I did . It 's exactly what I expected and wanted . I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work . For only $ 4 and some change for the both ... this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery !	1
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great . Does n't charge super fast but charges it none the less .	1
this product is great value for the price . and it works like it suppose to . you ca n't beat it . you always need extra cords .	1
It is what it is . A charging and sync cord . It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer .	1
works great . it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one .	1
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer . Works well and fits my needs and expectations .	1
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks	1
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far	1
It was what I expected to be and works fine , thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire ?	1
do you need to charge your phone ? so you need to transfer data ? then boy oh boy this cable does that .	1
It Works perfect . It charges my phone pretty quickly and it 's great that it retracts . No problems with this charger .	1
This is an excellent divice , I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine . Love it !	1
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it 's not necessary . Item was received quickly and was as seller stated . The cord retracts in a snap when I 'm done with it . It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere . I recommend it !	1
love it for moving from car to car . great for a mobile person . can pack in brief case or backpack when travel , without worry about cord hanging or wrapping .	1
I 've used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke . But I can still used it . The button that retracts it just got loose so it does n't latch anymore .	1
took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger . the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone . down side , ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord ! be careful ! haha .	1
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews . Price was great so I bought extras just in case . Quality seems great . Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments . Love not having the cords getting tangled in car	1
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely . I does the job just as well as a thick corded device . excellent product .	1
This works just fine to recharge my Captivate . With some products , it 's impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end ; this one does not have that problem .	1
Item shipped and arrived very fast . Item is perfect for my car & phone , very compact . Item is as advertise .	1
Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it .	1
Not much to say , here . This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store .	1
This is a very good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house . I use it frequently .	1
I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago , but this one is great .	1
It works great . It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone . I would recommend this item .	1
This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone . By dual use , I mean , the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end . Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply , which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery . Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately , but in the end , you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable ... like this one , which is just fine ... quality-wise and price-wise . Yep . Oh , and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall , whether your phone is plugged to it or not , so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep , you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light , because it is brighter then you may think .	1
we 've had it a month and it 's working great . wish the cord was a little longer but it 's much longer than the one you get with the phone .	1
it works and it works well . i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up . so far , so good ! the wire is thick and its well put together ! as far as im concerned , its well worth the small amount	1
Thanks for the quick delivery time . And , it actually is a quality note pad ! Mom loves it , it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work , this one is awesome !	1
I love that this has a longer cord ! It fits great in my phone ! Very pleased you have it so cheap ! Thanks !	1
Paid $ 0.32 for the charger and $ 2.81 Shipping & Handling ... ..Yeah , I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work ... ..which is an all day job huh ? LOL ! Wow , I wish I could write reviews for a living would n't that be nice ? I think the total price of $ $ 3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $ 10- $ 20 . Ms_Thrifty has done it again ! Stay tune to more reviews , Oh how I love Amazon !	1
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short . Works well . Charges phone quickly also . Would n't buy again however .	1
Its a charger and it works as advertised . It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well .	1
U can never have too many . Bought this as a spare for purse , home and work . Now I do n't have to worry about forgetting it .	1
Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed . Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do .	1
Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it ... ..Great job ... Would highly recommend this product to all customers.Thank you	1
Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel ... driving.If your BT is down on battery charge , this is handy . I just wish the length of the cord were longer ... .I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me ... . !	1
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months . So far all is well . Nice retractable cord . It retracts at the push of a button .	1
I have not used this as of yet , however , my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the voyage , it works on both really well .	1
works great for powering my Plantronics BT . i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way . nice and compact and easy to store when not in use	1
I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition , but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset . I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings , but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset . It is clean . No scratches . No faded labeling . It looked to be brand new . Oh yeah ... it works great , too. & # 128077 ;	1
I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece . The sound quality is great , and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this . The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt . The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it . Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic volume ( another nice feature ) or by moving the mic away from my mouth . Overall good purchase for the money .	1
I 've been using one of these for years ! I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out . The mic is always strong enough to pick up my voice , and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me . The ear-pad is comfy , and I occasionally forget I have this on . The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone , I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset , and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion . I do n't have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through .	1
Love this type of headset . I use one at work every day , so I got one for home too . I hate things & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; my ear , so this quality over-the-head type keeps everything where it belongs and I can wear it for hours with no pain or irritation . Comfortable and lightweight . Does n't even mess up hair . It includes a leatherette & # 34 ; cup & # 34 ; for the ear speaker , but I usually do n't even use it , finding it comfortable even without it . It converts to an & # 34 ; ear hook & # 34 ; type also , but I do n't find that very useful . The inline volume control and mute is nice , although a bit large and heavy . Great sound quality	1
I bought this for its durability , but the sound quality was pretty low/poor ; volume was low too .	1
This is a decent quality headset and sound quality from the ear piece is standard Plantronics quality ( i.e . very good ) . The 2.5mm jack means it wo n't fit on some mobile phones ( this is smaller than a standard headphone jack ) , but for my Blackberry it 's great ( both 8820 and Pearl ) . As a bonus , I also use it with my XBOX 360 controllers ( both with the attached messenger keyboard and without ) for online gaming . Some people have observed that I sound a little distant with this headset while plugged into the wireless XBOX controller , but repositioning the mic to be as close to my mouth as possible fixes it.There is an adjustable mic sensitivity switch on the plug , but this does n't seem to make any difference to people at the far end of the conversation.It 's held up quite well over the past few years , being stuffed in bags and traveling around . It 's not as cool as the wireless headsets ( bluetooth etc ) but it does n't take batteries , does n't have to be recharged and is n't subject to interference . I 'll buy it again if/when this one finally dies .	1
I love the product even though I messed up and did n't know I needed a 3.5 so had to purchase adaptor . I had a small issue that was my own fault and this company was outstanding with customer service .	1
These have great sound and my voice is clear to other parties . The volume switch and mute slider work well and it has lasted for some time .	1
I 've been buying these headsets for several years , recommending them to friends and associates and now I 'm buying them as gifts for the headset challenged . You know , people who literally have pains in their neck from clamping a phone between their head and shoulders.These are wonderful headsets . I 've used them with a variety of cordless and cell phones . As long as you have a 2.5mm socket , you 're in business . Audio reception is excellent even for those like me with moderate hearing loss . And the microphones are simply top-notch.I 've had only one break and that was because I crammed it into a travel case - and I mean crammed . With regard to ordinary daily abuse , these hold up well.All in all , an excellent value.Jerry	1
A nice change for me - having a headset that does n't slip and slide , fall out of my ear , or buzz . My favorite feature is the button that controls the sound level the recipient of my call experiences . The only time is does n't work well is when the listener is also wearing a headset , and even then , I suspect that it is the fault of the listener 's headset and not mine .	1
Before buying this set I searched a lot and did read a lot of reviews and finally I chose to go with this set . The screwdrivers are very easy to use specially with iphones.I had to change the batterry on my iphone and if Stanley screwdriver set was not there I was about to break my iphone.Thanks for making this set so helpful and easy to use .	1
Handy little set to have around if you tinker with electronic devices . This set has many uses for otherthings also . Product is as described and price is right . I recommend everyone having a set .	1
I bought this set to fix a pair of eyeglasses that had loose screws . The smallest screwdriver in this kit was perfect for that job , so mission accomplished . The tops of each screwdriver twirls independently from the shaft , meaning you can keep a finger on top of the head to stabilize the driver while you 're screwing . ( Sorry , there 's no other way to say that . ) The box suggests these screwdrivers can be used for repairing eyeglasses , cameras , watches , fishing reels , hobbies , electronics , and small appliances . I think this set will come in very handy .	1
Screwdrivers work well , however plastic separator tool tip broke off on the first phone case I used it to open ... what a drag .	1
I like them but they are not super duty materials . Works great for the application but when I was dismantling a hard drive one of them stripped . Im not too concerned because of the price . Over all good value !	1
This comes with 4 flats and 2 philips . I believe they are also metric in sizes . I used one to take a part a netbook . I like the fact that they spin , come in a plastic kit . They are reasonably priced . These items are high quality . Handles are small and can be hard to loosen a screw if torqued down . I used them for a laptop not as a jeweler so ... Nice case , nice color , small area , ... Comes in a card board cover as well . Packaged and more packaged . A little over doing it there . Ca n't be at times a little difficult to open the plastic case . Was going push up or down . Comes with different sizes . Some of the flats seemed a little thick in the blade . Not a bad item for the price . Always good to have a set of these around for glasses/sunglasses or for other items with small screws .	1
I had to replace the battery on my phone cause it had gone completely flat . Apple was charging a lot and this battery did the job perfectly for a lot cheaper and came with the tools .	1
plastic pry tool kinda sucks , but all the other tools in the kit are quite handy , helped me fix a broken screen on a $ 500 phone so saved a bit of cheddar there .	1
The tools helped greatly . I used the tools it provided and followed the instruction video on Youtube . Everything was done in about 30mins , for a beginner like me . The battery , which replaced my 2-year old original one , works well so far after about one and half months . It gets charged very quickly and lasted very long . For average user like me , the battery last for about 10 + hours every full charge .	1
Wish it was magnetized but it 's sturdy & has the common pieces I need when I 'm working on smaller items or electronics . Seems sturdy though only time will tell .	1
bought tool kit to do a battery upgrade on my cell phone . since it has an embedded battery I needed to take the phone apart . like the saying goes when you got the right tools things go a lot easier most of the time .	1
Used this in a phone I repaired , battery fit perfectly and seemed to work fine , phone was on 5 percent , left it for two days , then I checked and it was on 1 % , seems legit .	1
I must agree with Gary Tuscon 's review . For under $ 5 , even though the smallest flat-head screwdriver in here is 1.4 mm ( too large for the screws that hold the links on a Seiko women 's watchband ) , the quality is such that I will keep them . The case is very good and labeled very clearly . The screwdrivers have a decent weight as well and the handles turn smoothy.If these came in smaller sizes , with tempered tips that smaller sized tools need to be strong , I would definitely consider them as well.If I had one minor nitpick , it would be that a color-coding of the handles would be a great help , but really , this is an excellent value for the price .	1
These tools gets the job done . Had no problem I was able to finish less than a hour going to also buy two more for my friends . great deal and quality product quick and fast Thanks ! !	1
Very pleased with this tool kit . I have already gotten a couple phones repaired with this kit with no loss anywhere in the kit . Would purchase again if necessary .	1
This set has some very unique screw driver heads , the kind of set you need for working on cell phones or household small appliances . You would have a hard time finding some of them .	1
Seem to be high quality compare with the cost . Have every thing I needed ( or more ) to open my Motorola Droid .	1
I should 've ordered at least two sets . These come in handy for a lot of things , home , workplace , etc . And as soon as others know you have them , they need to & # 34 ; borrow & # 34 ; . Keep you eye on them ! Great tool for a lot of little projects . Fair price .	1
These tools are better than expected . The handles are hard plastic but fit my hand nicely and the the rotating tops work well . The tweezer ends match perfectly so they pick up small parts with ease . Similarly , the driver tips are well machined and accurately sized . Only the plastic prying tool seems a bit flimsy , but it nevertheless held up to some hard prying without breaking . In all , a good deal and I 'm ordering a second set this evening .	1
Needed for my Razr cellphone to change the internal battery . More tiny screwdrivers than I 'll ever use but are of good quality for what I needed .	1
After viewing some youtube videos on this procedure , I was able to swap the battery in about 1/2 hour ( which included taking pictures and studying the insides of the iPhone 4S.The tools are good enough to get the job done -- I never felt that the tools were going to fall apart . In fact , I 'm keeping them around for other mobile phone work.The only thing I 'd recommend ( esp . for older folks with not-so-good eyesight ) is a good way to magnify things so you can see what you 're doing . I use a big magnifying glass , 1.5x reading glasses ( 3x would be better ) , a headlamp ( to add light where I need it ) .	1
Does not fit the 4s so make sure you are ordering the right one . You will need tools , so I suggest you get one with tools .	1
I had to pop open my Samsung Galaxy S3 to fix it up but none of the tools I had worked or fit . These worked perfectly and fit the screws and took it apart with ease . Compact and easy to carry around.It arrived on time and in good shape . Thanks !	1
worked great	1
I use these for electronics repairs . There are several sizes and configurations to meet various needs . The most helpful thing about them is the independently turning barrel which allows you to apply pressure on the end of the tool and easily turn the barrel/screw right or left . They may not be the best tools on the market , but they have served me well .	1
Nothing too special over here . Just some screwdrivers . Seem to hold up well . I used them on my g-shock band , and they worked and did n't strip , so I was pleased .	1
I got this to try and replace a screen , found out I 'm not a phone repair person . It did have what I needed , lacking skill needed to do the job . I can replace my hard drive in my home computer , and add memory , this takes allot more skill . If you have the skill , the tools are great and very complete . I had everything the video said I needed , minus the skill .	1
very helpful and good quality	1
I rate this 5 stars . Love this product ! great price and quality . Love how it works with my iphone 4 . And it comes with a lot of tools which is great , in case you misplace one of them .	1
Very fast delivery . product is as described and useful tool . If you need a set of these this is a good one	1
I use these mostly for electronics repair and they get they job done . Great for phone repair or and small electronics .	1
I watched a short video on you tube then ordered this kit . I changed the battery in just a few minutes . Amazingly simple . All the tools you need are here ( the star screw driver is the only thing thats not really standard , but here its all in one place ) . Just do it .	1
You may not need these types of screwdrivers often , but when you do need them , nothing else will do . They 're great for tightening eyeglass screws or opening up the cases of small electronic devices.This is a nice set . It comes with 4 slotted and 2 philips style in a variety of sizes . They seem to be well made and I suspect that they last a long time . The swivel heads allow you to put downward pressure on the screwdriver as you turn it to minimize the risk of stripping the head on delicate small screws . The case has a labeled space for each screwdriver . It 's your typical plastic case with a snap top and should hold up as long as you do n't step on it or drop something on it . This set is a nice value for the price .	1
It is chinesse ( like almost everything in this world LOL ) but they are really well done , and for the price they are a bargain.The screw drivers have a free rolling top to make pressure , and the body is rellay good , nice grip and 3 lobules ergonomics.The pliers are just as good as you can get , no problems with them and good finish on the edges , not like razors like othersthe prying tool is just what you need for almost any device you want to tear apart ( besides the iPad ) they have enough strenght to pry out plastics and even aluminun bodys of smartphones.There is to mini screwdriver , a flat an a phillips , I use them for electronics.Overall pretty satisfied , I would buy another one later on	1
Once or twice a month you need a smaller screwdriver than your always handy six -in-one . This setfills the bill nicely . When you need it you need it . A must have .	1
this item came in a timely matter and fit the descrition the only thing that the plastic broke a little to easily but other than that every thing else is good	1
Nothing fancy but is extremely useful when you need it ! love the tweezers and the big writing telling me which tool is which size . Took a while , 3-4 weeks i 'd guess , but was worth the wait ! I 'd easily recommend them .	1
Like others have said here , the screwdriver set is solid and good quality and will last forever . The issue of course here is that the screwdrivers are not a true jewelers set and will be too big for most jewelry/watch related tasks . So if you are looking for that type of set , this isnt the one to use .	1
I needed a new screwdriver set to work on laptops with , as most of my old ones have mysteriously disappeared . At the price , there was no way I was going to beat a set of Stanleys . The best part so far , to me , is that they come already magnetized . I put them to use the day I received them , and am quite happy with them .	1
now I have it . I can carry it with me and always have the perfect size tool for the little things that go wrong .	1
i have used this kit to fix a bunch of cell phones and price is right and tools work great	1
I bought this for my wife 's 2 year old iphone 4S . She said it seemed to work about the same or a little better than the old battery . Not a huge improvement , but an acceptable replacement if you need a new battery .	1
This review is for the iPhone 5 battery and tool set . I realize now that the company is selling several different items under the same listing , so the reviews can be confusing and not accurate.Like many other & # 34 ; power users & # 34 ; ( i.e . slaves ) of their iPhones , I came to the end of the usefulness for my iPhone 5 's internal battery . After lamenting on whether or not to buy some of the cheaper options available , I went with the & # 34 ; you get what you pay for & # 34 ; cliche and paid for the extra assurance that I was not getting a cheap knockoff.The battery I received had a manufacturer date only a few months from when I ordered the piece . Who knows how accurate that is , but if you 're taking it at face value , I find certain comfort knowing that my battery has n't been sitting on the shelf losing it 's potential usefulness in holding a charge for my crushing of candies.After successfully opening my phone , I can confirm that all the labeling and signage match exactly to what is on the original battery in my phone . Any copycat can do this , but it gives me hope that this new battery comes from the same manufacturers as the OEM battery.The tools worked just fine for me . I was able to pry the top glass of my phone off by using the tools provided in the kit . Do some extra research around properly removing the battery . Use the clear plastic sheet under the battery to help lift it up and separate from the adhesive . That was the most challenging part of my battery replacement . After two months of use , I can make it through the whole day after heavy phone use without looking for a charger . My life is complete again !	1
This is a good buy if it is what you are wanting . I misread the product info and did not realize this is all Torx screwdrivers .	1
This was a great deal . Easy to install and a direct fit replacement for the iPhone 4s . Does what it should and hopefully it will last .	1
I fix my own phones and Tab 3 and Mac computers ( desk top and laptop ) , and IPad ( s ) . So having the right tools are very important to me . The price was the thing that did it for me . Great price ! !	1
I bought this set and have repaired my android a few times already and it 's a must have tool set when working on such small electronics	1
Great tools , I still use them and I like the quality , great price as well.Good vendor.I would buy more .	1
This tool set is better than expected . The machining and finish is very good . If used for small electronics and similar applications , this set should be durable .	1
This was a great deal for the set . High quality materials at a low price . I would recommend this product to a friend .	1
Tools were required for opening GPS , iPOD , etc cases . Nice selection of sizes . The plastic wedge tool is easily damaged . A five star rating if it included a case ( I would have even paid extra for a case )	1
the Torx screwdrivers were great , the tweesers were substandard , and the spluger was very cheap , mine broke the first time i used it . For the price you can not expect high quality . all in all it did the job	1
These were a supper price and while not supper strong they will do the job and you get a lot for your money .	1
For the price , you can not beat this little Stanley screwdriver set . This one features several very tiny standard and Phillips head screwdrivers . If you have a need for very small head screwdrivers , this one is for you . These are useful for messing with eyeglasses , certain electronics gadgets , and firearms . I have several revolvers and pistols which have sight adjustments that have outrageously small adjustment screws . For these sights this little kit is a must -- none of my other tools could manage to fit these screws but this one did . That alone made it worth the Amazon price and this little kit has a permanent place in my range shooting bag . RJB .	1
This tool repair kit is useful for repairs on a laptop , smartphone , eyeglasses , and anything else with very small screws .	1
I really needed the torx driver tools to fix broken Nexus 4 back plate and this kit worked great . I 'm really glad to have it around in case I need it again .	1
i ordered this to replace my iphone battery , i am a deployed soldier and now i have become the cell phone technition	1
The battery worked very well ! I used the screwdriver and the plastic pieces of the kit in replacement , and the tips of the spudger get bent without hard use - such as prying the old battery out . Still , a great value in a DIY kit to give new life to your tired iPhone 4S !	1
I tried two ( yes , two ) batteries and had to send both back because both were crap . I finally decided to spend a bit more hoping it would equate to more quality . Well that seems to have paid off ( third time 's the charm I guess ) . The battery itself replaced my old battery perfectly . It holds a charge well and reads the correct battery percentage . The included tools were a bonus . I already had a set of tools from replacing my wife 's battery a while back . However these were much better . The old tools I had were stripping the tiny screw heads . This set of tools gripped the screw heads perfectly . Overall I 'm very happy .	1
very handy tools i mostly use it when i have to fix soomething small like phones docks and other cool stuff	1
very nice quality set of screwdrivers . they sell bigger sets on here for cheaper , but made by a different company . DO NOT BUY THEM . if you want a quality precision set of drivers . this is the company to go with .	1
Got this to replace an iphone5 battery that was only useable when it was tethered . Now it holds full charge and is ready to go . Great OEM repalcement . The tools are nice enough to use again too .	1
I have never bought an actual set in a box before . Over the years I have just cobbled together an odd assortment of small screwdrivers . This was well rated , inexpensive , and in a case . It is all that I expected . It works for me .	1
Good but if you plan to repair or take apart apple products this kit is completely useless and wo n't be worth it	1
Was about ready to send my Jawbone Era back . Then I ordered the Jabra ear gels . Now I can wear my Jawbone all day ! Aliph should include these with the Jawbone headsets . And I intend to tell them ! Jawbone Era is awesome too !	1
I bought these eargels for my bluetooth , which happens to be a Samsung WEP200 , and it fit it perfectly . Gives great comfort and a perfect fit . Comes with more than just three . Comes with a whole bunch . Highly recommended product	1
I bought these to use with my Jawbone Era bluetooth headset . The Era comes with 9 different options for ear inserts . But I always felt like the earpiece was about to fall out , unless I jammed it into my ear so far that it became uncomfortable.Enter the Jabra EarGels ... These made a huge difference . It fit perfectly onto my ear ( the nub on the top goes into the spot above the ear hole ) . I could wear this all day . I would n't wear these eargels without having an over-the-ear hook attachment on my Era , but these have made a huge difference for the comfort of my bluetooth earpiece .	1
I bought these to redirect sound into the ear for my jawbone . TO that end it worked like a champ . the only issue I have is that after about a year they started to yellow . I guess that is common with these clear jelly products though .	1
The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I can not believe how comfortable , and user friendly they are . Thank you , if not for these , I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..	1
I purchased these because the original ear pieces from jabra were OK but left me pushing on my headset constantly trying to get it in my ear more . Which , unfortunately , resulted in a lot of accidental button pushing and disconnecting calls.I saw these on Amazon and thought they were worth trying . I loved that you get basically 6 ear gels in 3 sizes for both right and left error.I found a size that fit my ear perfectly and was able to use the headset without the earband which was a surprise.The ear gels are gentle and fit in the ear . Only reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is that it takes quite a bit of adjusting and finesse to get the gel on the headset . Also , while I enjoyed the product I feel it may be slightly over priced for what you get.But overall a great product and the sound is now channelled directly into my ear so I do n't have to keep pushing my headset in to hear . I would recommend this product to others who find the jabra sound decent but also wish it would go in the ear a little more .	1
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them	1
These Ear Gels Work Very Well , Comfort Is The Main Reason I Bought Them , Fit The Ear Very Well , The Price Was Right , You Will Not Go Wrong With These Ear Gels , That Is Why I Gave Them Five Stars	1
Works great on ear buds . I bought these to put on my basic ear buds and have them fit more comfortable so I can wear them longer . Great for wearing in the car during long drives .	1
Purchased the Jawbone bluetooth headset . It was just not comfortable , but with these all is great now . Could not ask for a better set of earpieces . Great use of my money to get these .	1
I like this Jabra earboom so much that I have purchased 6 of these so far . And that is my biggest complaint , is their poor quality of workmanship . They work well but just do n't last . Granted , I 'm a road warrior and my earbooms probably go through more abuse than a casual user . The reason I keep buying them is the audio quality is fantastic and the fit within my ear is solid . I keep two spares on hand at all times so as soon as one fails I can throw it away and move on . At this price , I can afford it . Also , Jabra customer services is great . I lost the windscreen for the boom mic once and an email to them got me a set of windscreens in my mailbox , no charge .	1
these are the very best quality at a AWESOME price.Save $ 20 . over a cell phone company price .	1
Yeah , I know , they warned me ; but I thought I was smarter than the average bear- not so.If you have auto reverse on your tape player and you can not shut the feature off , this will not work . It may work for a few minutes at a time , but will always end up frustrating you by switching every few minutes.If you can turn off the auto reverse ( or do n't have it ) , it 's a very solid product that sounded great.For those like me who need a FM transmitter instead of the tape version , I 'd suggest the Soundkase FM Transmitter for iPod & MP3s . We 've been using it for a week or 2 with good results ( and from my research , probably the best results you can get if you ca n't use a tape connection ) .	1
Good Item , BUT ... ..The sound could be better ... U get what u Pay For ! ! $ 8.00 for this as opposed to minimum $ 130 for a CHEAP CD installed in the dash.Well worth the couple of $ $ $	1
I was worried about having problems with the Auto Reverse , but it worked the very first time in my '05 Audi A4 with factory stereo . The sound quality is n't CD level , but then again its better than my old FM transmitter .	1
Purchased this to try out in the workplace . Do n't have access to a decent sound system , so wanted to be able to pipe some mp3s through the clunky boom boxes that are available , without having to lug around a CD case . I was very pleased to find the sound quality is excellent . Playing mp3s from a phone or player sounds more clear and louder than if I were to tune in a radio station . This model had some of the best reviews on the site , and it appears to be a good unit so far . I had to go with 5 stars because you ca n't beat the price for something that works this well . **Update** It has been about a couple of months so I thought I should add that this unit has worked out great so far . It gets many hours of use and delivers very clean sound . I could n't be happier with this purchase .	1
I have been using this Coby CA-747 Cassette Adapter for more than 2 years to use my car stereo to play audio of my DVD-player and CD-player . Until lately , my car tape player kept rejecting it out . I thought it was broken and I was about to buy this same product from Amaonz again . While reading some other people 's reviews , I bump into R. Penny 's feedback on 10/26/05 about the `` skip '' mode as following : '' One thing to keep in mind when using any product like this - some ( but not all ) car tape players have a `` skip '' mode . When a tape player 's `` skip '' mode is active , it listens for silent portions of the tape . If it is detects any silence for more than a few seconds , it will automatically go into fast forward until it `` hears '' sound again . If your tape player has a `` skip '' mode , be sure to cancel this mode - i.e. , put the player in `` normal '' play mode . Otherwise , you will find the tape player trying to `` fast forward '' over any silent portions of your audio feed . `` This is exactly the problem that I was having . By turning off the `` skip '' mode of the car tape player , my car tape player does not reject the Coby Cassette Adapter anymore.Again , even if it is indeed broken , I will buy the same product again . Very good product for the money .	1
I bought this cassette adapter to replace my old one who 's cord got ripped in half when stuck in my door . I get better sound out of this one than I did from my other one that I originally bought for more than twice the price.The best part of this cassette adapter is that the cord is coiled , and can be stretched to be super long ( probably at least 8 feet although I have not checked ) yet when no tension is applied ( during normal use or storage ) the cord is only about 3 feet long . This keeps it from getting stuck in things like car doors or wrapped around steering wheels or getting all tangled which my old adapter did.I am very pleasantly surprised at this adapter . I more than got my money 's worth out of it .	1
works great in my 2002 honda accord ! other adapters have either gimped the frequency range or only come out of one speaker .	1
Just for kicks I did a `` local order '' at 2am Monday morning because it said the package would still arrive on Monday . I did n't believe it , so I figured , `` I 'll pay for that and when it does n't arrive on time I 'll get my money back for the shipping cost '' ( I mean come on , it was 300 miles south of me ! ! ) . Only 12 hours later the package had come 300 miles onto my doorstep . That my friends is dedication to one 's time commitment . Wow.As far as the product goes I love it ! The plug is the stretchy spiral type so it does n't hang around getting tangled on my feet while I 'm driving . It was way better than that last stupid cheap one I bought at best buy that the cord wore out on after 2 months . The sound quality is really not bad once you learn how to adjust the volumes properly . Everything you should expect from a cassette adapter.In order to get the volumes adjusted for optimal sound quality ( without that white noise the tape players give off ) , adjust your phone or other mobile music device to 75 % volume and keep it there while plugged in . From this point just use your car 's volume to amplify the volume.Good luck !	1
I have a cassette player in my car and wanted to be able to plug my MP3 player into it . This adapter looks like a cassette with a wire coming out of the end . It slides into my car player and when I plug it up to my mp3 player , it plays through the system with no problem . I have not had any trouble from it yet as others have written about . I went on a trip 2 weeks ago and used it for several hours . It worked great . The wire can be changed to come out of the side or the back , depending on which way your auto player is oriented .	1
OMG , if u have a tape deck and need AUX use this product , it 's not exspensive and sounds great and works with MP3 , CD players , phones . its got awsome sound ! ! ! way better than a FM Transmitter ! ! ! ! !	1
I was using an FM modulator , but did n't like that with my iPhone , it would create feedback in the car speakers , so I decided to switch over to a cassette adapter . This one works fantastic for the price . Sound quality is fine , about what you would expect from a cassette tape . The cord can be adjusted to travel from the adapter horizontally or vertically , which is great depending on your tape deck.The only negative I found was that after a few weeks of use , it stopped working properly . My car 's tape deck is an auto-reverse deck , and I have no idea why it worked perfectly for weeks , then shut down on me and stopped , but if you look at J Cristofferson 's review , there are tons of comments on how to fix this . I used these instructions to open the cassette ( Carefully , lifting the two screw side so as not to lose all the pieces ) , and removed the tape reverse assembly . Then , as stated in that review , remove the metal screw that holds in the white gear without the black band around it , putting the screw and spring back on without that single gear . Put everyhting back together , and like magic , the cassette works perfectly now , even in my auto-reverse deck.I only wish that it came designed to do this without modifying it , but trust me , opening up the tape and fixing this is so simple . Takes about 5 minutes , and I have no experience with this kind of thing whatsoever , so if I can do it , you can do it !	1
Pros : - Love the adjustable dual position for the cord . Most players you need to insert the cassette sideways , but I had some players before that you need to insert the cassette lengthwise . You will never go wrong with this adapter as you can feed it to your cassette player both ways.- Does not look cheap . It looks more decent than other cassette adapters I have that costs 20 $ - The coiled cord is great and much less clutter . I had a cassette adapter that has a cord that was too long , it got caught under the seat and the only way to remove it is to cut it.- Sounds good too with my Ipod.Cons : - The only thing I can think of is it still makes noticeable clicking sound while in the cassette.Bought this item twice already .	1
We have a 93 Mercedes which has a tape player that is oriented to take the tape width ways . This unit can have the input cable changed to accomodate this type of side loading tape . Sound quality is great . I did not have to modify the unit like some of the other purchasers have mentioned . Sometimes the adjustable input cable connector gets loose and just needs to be plugged in tightly .	1
my car had to get used to it as it is old but after a few try 's have n't had any issues with it since and it just plays the music on and on now but i will note it does n't sound beautiful might be my cars speakers though not sure .	1
I would agree with the majority of the reviews . I purchased this for my car . I do n't have the MP3 connection but do have a tape deck . And I was n't thrilled with the quality of sound with the FM tuners ( my brother has one for his car ) . There is a little bit of a clicking sound that appears once it starts playing , but with road nose and the general nose of the car , it is a non-issue ... ca n't even hear it . The quality of the sound is not as good as if having a direct MP3 connection , but I consider it very good ... ( not sure it 's even fair to compare ) . I use this primarily for audio books , and I am very happy with my purchase . I have not had to try the fix that some of the other reviewers had ( something about needing to take out a pin on the inside of the cassette ) .I would definitely recommend !	1
My car does n't have an iPod connector so I bought this product . I have been using this for over a year now and I am very happy with it . This works amazingly well .	1
I set my phone down on my computer desk for 10 minutes and I checked the Signal Strength on my Droid X and it read -87 dBm . After putting the Universal Cell Phone Antenna Booster on the inside of my batter cover I set my phone in the exact same spot for 10 minutes and It read -83 dBm ( closer the number to zero the better the reception ) . So I guess it works a little bit . Check out the picture I posted of the signal strength before and after .	1
DO NOT USE THIS THOUGH IF YOUR PHONE IS STILL UNDER WARRANTY CUZ US CELLULAR SAID IT VOIDED MY WARRANTY , BUT US CELLULAR IS THE WORST CELL PHONE CARRIER OUT THERE . I SHOULD NOT HAVE EVEN NEEDED THIS WITH A BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 BUT I DID ... THE INSTRUCTIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT	1
I 've always had one of these on my phone . Had to get a new phone while on vacation and the service at my rental was terrible ! ! ! Slapped one of these on and , I do n't know if it 's the power of suggestion , but my new phone works soooo much better ! ! ! ! Love these things ! Recommend ! ! !	1
I bought tis booster for my phone because I needed better recepion , I tryed it and it made my phone come in a little better I would buy is product again , if fact I bought one for the whole family .	1
It helped me get improved signal strength for cellular ( phone ) communications , but does nothing to improve my Android phone 's 3G data signal or WiFi data signal . I did n't expect it to and I do n't think it 's design to improve 3G/Wifi so if that 's what you 're hoping for , forget it . If you want more bars ... this works very well .	1
Order this product just to find out if it does work..and sure enough I was surprise that I get more bars reception in my cell than I had before and the price is right .	1
Its simply awesome . What else to say ?	1
I 've had my T610 for about 3 months now and I 'm still in love with it . I highly recommend getting a bluetooth adapter for your computer to take advantage of customizing this baby . I 've downloaded Midi files , games and photos off the web and copied them to the T610 for FREE ! No SMS charges or web site fees . It 's everything I wanted in a new cell phone . Camera , color display , fully customizable . It 's great . Battery life is still good . Standby about 3 to 4 days , talk about 3 to 5 hours , maybe more . The down side ... Color display hard to see in bright daylight ( but not impossible ) , it has frozen on me a few times , mostly with internet . Internal antenna may not be as strong as an external , but I usually get great reception even with only 1 bar showing ( inside bldgs ) . Highly recommend , might want to look into the T626 or T630 for better color display . Go get it !	1
Overall , I think that it 's a safe investment in a mobile phone . One sad thing about cell phones is that they improve so quickly , there 's always a race to have the best.Right now , this phone is one of the best , without the 300+ pricetag . If you 're paying 300 for it , you are n't getting a good deal.Clear reception , included ear piece is more comfortable than the generics that come with a phone like the R225 Samsung.Great display . Only downside is the wiping it off thing . Oils form your skin and ear show up easily on the pristine surface . Very clear pictures and nice graphics.I give it a 10 out of 10 .	1
I 've had mine for almost two months now and I 'm happy with all aspects of this wonderful powerful phone . Will definitely buy another S-E phone again in the future . I still do n't like T-Mobile 's coverage and especially service support , but this phone is a star . Some may find teh buttons a bit too small , but they are well-spaced so fine for my large hands . Voice clarity is superb for me , and the quality/durability is great .	1
Now that I have used the SE T610 phone for almost 2 months with my Palm Zire 72 and HP IPAQ 4155 , I must give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1 ) The Camera is great . The pictures come out real clear and beautiful after you send it via Email . Please do n't judge the quality of the pictures by what you see on the T610 . I admit that the pictures look a little fuzzy on the T610 . But with only 2MB of memory the purpose of taking pictures is to upload them or send them via Email to others . The quality of the pictures improves dramatically once they are sent and viewed via one 's PC.2 ) The Bluetooth features on this phone are outrageous . I have paired my SE T610 using T-Mobile 's unlimited VPN GPRS Data Service with my Palm Zire 72 , HP IPAQ 4155 , and Logitech Mobile Wireless Bluetooth Headset and Performance is Great . If you got a Bluetooth enabled Palm or Pocket PC , then this is the phone for you . Sony Ericsson was in on the ground floor on this Bluetooth Revolution . I send data via my Pocket PC and Palm to my SE T610 via Bluetooth in a flash . Moreover , web surfing is much faster than I thought via Bluetooth.3 ) I have absolutely NO problem with signal strength or clarity of voice calls in NYC where I primarily use this phone . Where I go in the boroughs of Queens , Bronx , Manhatten , Brooklyn and Nassau County ( with the exception of Garden City ) is great.People need to realize that T-Mobile does not have the extensive network that Verizon or even Sprint has . So , if you are looking to buy this phone to use with the T-Mobile Network , I can enthusiastically recommend it if you live in most of NYC ( outside of Staten Island ) . However , you need to do your own due diligence and check out in advance whether this phone will perform well with your service provider in the area where you live .	1
I 've had my T610 + Tmobile for about a month now ( So no word on the rebates yet ) but as for the phone and service ... I 've been pretty satisfied . I get pretty good reception everywhere ... The phone is small and comfortable and everything seems to work on it without a hitch . The camera is good enough for a cell phone ... and the phone was more pleasing after I got a few new games/themes/ringtones on it via the infrared port . The phone does n't have all that much memory but I deleted all the predefined themes/songs/graphics ( or at least all the ones it lets you ) , and that gave me more than enough . It has n't frozen on me yet ( and mine came with the oldest firmware ) . I heard upgrading the firmware resolves freezing issues , increases the quality/compression of the pictures , and overall makes the phone more useable ... but I none of these things have affected me like others , so I have n't looked into how to upgrade it . Unfortunately , you cant just update the firmware yourself ... Two of my friends also have the same package and are pretty happy with it . I think most the reviews on here are just people who 've had negative experiences ...	1
Good product . Quick shipment was provided by the vendor and item was exactly as described . I am Very satisfied with this purchase	1
This is an excellent replacement battery , it fit just fine and the price was amazing . Anyone needing to replace that old battery that wo n't hold a charge should totally look into getting one of these !	1
The item is working very good . My phone does not have problem with power with this battery and me neither .	1
If I 'd bought this battery where I bought the cell phone , it would 've cost much , much more . I did n't need a new phone - just a new battery - so instead of adding another used cell phone to the trash heap , I 've recycled a used battery and kept the phone I really like ! The phone now works like new !	1
I bought this to try and repair a POS dash cam , even though this battery is great it was not the issue ... It fit perfectly and accepted charge as it should .	1
Works great . I 've been using this for over a year , seems to hold charge good as OEM ( it is OEM )	1
Bought this for my wife to use with her Samsung Exclaim . For those that do n't know , the device clips to your earlobe after placing the speaker in your ear . She loves being hands free now . If you want to go hands free without going the bluetooth route , get this headset . It will only work in a phone with a 2.5mm jack . Most smartphones are 3.5mm ( like standard headphones ) .	1
I love the compact design and fit of the ear rest . You can barely tell you are wearing this thing . The mic picks up great ! Using this thing all the time now and keeping spares in the car for when bluetooth gets fussy ...	1
This has to be the cheapest headset I have ever purchased , yet the best small headset ever made . It lasts forever ! I only bought it for Xbox live but it works great with cell phones too . It says its made by plantronics in the description but the headset itself says verizon on the side so I 'm not sure what the deal is with that but I know that it works great . So if you 're looking for a nice regular headset for xbox live because the microsoft headsets break all the time or for a cell phone , buy this headset . I went ahead and bought another one before they 're sold out . Try to buy from OEM planet if they got it in stock , they are the best in my opinion .	1
I do n't know , I 've always liked high-tech and loved the idea of bluetooth , even though it tends to make one look like a space alien contacting the mother ship or a blathering fool until someone notices the bluetooth unit in your ear.But I 've never gotten good reception with bluetooth units or enough batter life . Do n't get me started on static and wind noise.That 's why for the money you ca n't do better than these wired units . They 're lightweight , comfortable , and have ample cord length . I 've ordered several , and you 'd pay 3 times the price in a bog-box electronics store . Do yourself a favor , even if you do own a bluetooth , keep one of these one hand . Well worth the price .	1
It 's perfect for those of us who do n't have smartphones or a headphone jack . Sound quality is excellent and it makes multitasking so much easier . Long wire so that you can put your phone in your pocket no problem .	1
Purchased a total of 3 so far.. 1st one had no sound but seller replaced immediately.. others were purchased to use by co-workers instead of the $ 50.00 apiece ones they were given from verizon purchase.. Stay in ear and work well ...	1
Does what it is supposed to and comfortable to wear . The only downside is there is a slight whooshing sound in the ear piece , may or may not be caused by the phone .	1
It was liked so much that even when it broke the user wanted the same product as a replacement . I ordered 3 .	1
I purchased one of these headsets many years ago and was very happy with it . Well , my husband tried it and decided he needed it since he did a lot of driving for work . I was very happy to see that these were still available and at a much better price than what I paid way back.I love that I can use these with my cordless phones as well as my cell phone . I prefer the corded sets , they just seem to have a better sound quality . I love that this earpiece fits snuggly around your lobe . I wear glasses and this works out great . I go between this style and one that wraps around my head , it just depends on which handset I pick up . Highly recommend to anyone who prefers the corded headset .	1
I 've bought about 20 of these things by now , and shared them with many friends & family , who rave about them . It 's comfortable and fits in your ear , and the sound quality ( especially the noise cancellation on the mic ) is *stellar* - you can be driving down a noisy freeway and the person listening to you will *never* know you 're in the car.I tried several Bluetooth headsets and was thoroughly unimpressed : you have to charge them , they add latency , they add extra compression artifacts , and the audio clips in and out on you.This headset has the disadvantage of having a wire , but it 's also about 1/20th the price of a Bluetooth headset , and wo n't give you cancer . ( Ever since I got a large benign osteoma in my skull after , suspiciously , 6 months of very heavy cell phone use , I 'm a bit paranoid about cell phone radiation ) .The jack is the smaller size ( 2.5 mm ) , which is unfortunate , as most smartphones these days are 3.5mm ( so you can plug in a headset or just headphones ) . So , once I got a smartphone , I ended up buying half a dozen adapters , because I love this headset so much .	1
I got a pair of Plantronics-branded headsets in Verizon OEM packaging ( plastic bag ) , each coming with a `` universal '' adapter ( micro-USB male to 2.5mm female ) . The price was substantially the same ( per unit ) . But there is a small issue -- there are two sets of pictures on this product that represent two different units . The two on the right , with the plastic bag that is clearly labeled MX150xxxx are identical to what I have . Note the obvious button showing through the plastic ( this one mutes , turns off the call or voice-dials on my Blackberry , but it may do other things on other models ) . However , the other photos show the same headset , but without the control button -- not a different button , but nothing at all ! This made me wonder what is being sold as MX150 . The other issue is color . It 's not clear if you get the black or a gray one or even if there is a choice . From the photo , one would assume that this dealer supply the gray ones , but I am not so sure . This is not exactly an item one buys for style points ( it 's compact , but looks bulky on the face ) , so it 's a minor point , but it would be good to have some clarity.But , as far as the product itself goes , it 's perfectly functional for the purpose -- cheap branded headset ( for me , specifically to complement a BT set , which this one replaces when charge runs out ) . I 've had a number of cheap or free headsets ( often even enclosed with a phone ) and virtually all of them have awful raspy and tinny sound . That 's not what I want in a headset , even for $ 3 . But I needed an emergency headset and this one fit the bill . The sound quality is far superior to no-name headsets -- on both ends . It 's better than an average Sony/Ericsson handset -- I always add a headset to those when using them since Sony deliberately puts crappy speakers into Ericsson phones to make you buy their headsets . When traveling through NY or DE or any other state that requires no-hands on the phone , it is essential to be quickly disconnect and replace a discharged BT headset . I have no qualms about using this one.UPDATE ( 9 months later ) : I got another of these sets for a friend but , although it fit , the phone rejected it as not compatible . It was a cheap ATT/Nokia handset to replace a lost phone so I am not surprised about compatibility issues . But that also meant that I got an extra set . About a month ago , one of the sets died when the phone got yanked too hard ( probably a loose contact ) . At less than $ 2 each , I had no problem tossing it and pulling out the next one ( and I still have two more left , having spent a total of $ 6 , including shipping ) . So , aside from Nokia compatibility , still no complaints .	1
The ony draw back to this product is that it is corded . IF they could make the same product wireless it would be Exceptional . I love it , has great sound , cofortable in my ear and it plays the different ringtones i have for callers so i can know whos callings .	1
I have an old style flip phone which uses 2.5mm plugs . This works well by being clipped to my ear and I can use it to chat hands free .	1
No problems connecting to my pre-existing phone at work . Ear loops not the most comfortable so I have ordered the behind the head neckband ( Plantronics 64397-01 Neckband for CS50/M3000 ) ( waiting for delivery ) . Highly recommended headset regardless !	1
Like most people I have owned multiple styles of headsets and had varying degrees of success with them . This Plantronics CS50 is simply the best unit I have ever used . The unit worked my desktop phone answering system in my office . I was on the phone every day and for 6 hours or more on a rough day.I got tired of holding a phone to my ear in the office for hours and being 50 feet away from my desk and missing the important call I was waiting for . This device solved both problems . The headset unit gives you call answer and end control with your fingertips as well as volume and mute control . It gave me remote ring detection and allowed me to be up to 300 feet away from my desk and catch that important call . It would operate for up to 8 hours but it has a desktop control stand that charged the headset while I am in a meeting or at lunch.I used the Plantronics HL 10 Handset Lifter and by touching the button on the headset I could answer the phone remotely with ease . The sound going both ways was excellent and I never had an issue with the unit . Other designs I had tried were not always clear and people would complain that they could not hear me . Not with this unit . The noise cancelling mike and the cushioned ear piece made for excellent communication and comfortable wearing for long hours during the day.The unit has a fast recharge time in about 3 hours for 100 % full charge from empty . The headset is extremely light and comfortable and the phone transmission is digitally encrypted for security and privacy . This is the first tool I would buy if I were setting up a new office today . It is great !	1
Very clear transmission of calls both incoming and outgoing . Easy integration with current phone system . I would buy again if needed .	1
I took one start off , because I think that these headsets should be ~100 or less for what we are getting , and this one was the best deal that I could find ! The plastic housing on the charger unit could be sturdier f they are going to charge consumers these prices for must haves items like this.That being said , this is my first day using it and I have a 12 hour conference call at work , so I may edit my review later . I am impressed so far . The setup was super easy . I plugged it into my VoIP phone and away I went ! There was something in the description about & # 34 ; USB , & # 34 ; but this unit is hooks up to the phones headset port via a regular old telephone jacks input . There is not USB on this model . The company does make a USB model , but this is not it . I called Amazon to confirm that before I ordered it and the rep looked it up for me , he was very helpful.I am using the mute feature now , and I like how it beeps every so often to remind me that I am muted . I can go about my business here without the person on the other end hearing everything that I do , but I can still hear what is being said on the other end.Overall I would say if you are on the phone all day , or work from home like I do , get one !	1
Mine died and I needed a new one . Works perfect just like my old one . Good product would recommend to anyone .	1
I 've had this headset for many years ( at least 5+ , but I ca n't remember exactly when I got it ) . I am giving it 4 stars for : -simple set up-great sound quality-solid talk and standby time-comfortable , with a variety of wearing options-durability ( still serves its purpose after 5+ years ) I am taking away 1 star for 2 reasons : -Over the course of several years , the charger has gotten finicky . If I do n't place the headset in just right , and jiggle it a little to make sure it has a good connection , it does n't charge . Not a tremeendous problem except for those rare occassions when I forget to double check when I put it in the charger , and I end up with a dead headset.-There is a very noticeable buzz in the line if you use the phone handset , which means you MUST use the headset . I 've looked at set up , but there is really only one way to connect the wires , so I do n't believe there is way to avoid this . The simple solution is to just always use the headset , which is fine , but ... ... on those occassions where the headset is dead ( see above ) , you 're left with no great option . When that happens , I end up having to use the speakerphone on my phone until the headset is charged again . Not a really big deal , but then I get people asking `` talk me off speaker phone '' , and I have to explain to them that I can't.Since this model is older , the 2 negatives above may have been fixed in more recent models . Since this unit is still for sale , and apparently people are still buying it , I though I would just write this quick review.One thing to keep in mind ... ..know what you are getting with this . If you have a typical desk phone , then you will need to physically lift the handset to answer calls , and physically lower the handset to end calls . You can get a remote lifter that does the lifting for you , but I 've never had one , so I ca n't comment on them . I 've heard mixed reviews about the remote lifters , but do your own research . Regardless , just know that for a typical desk phone ( i.e . one that is used in a home office , with the phone line going into the phone ) , You ca n't just tap to talk or tap to end the call . Somebody or something has to raise and lower the handset . If you have a `` soft phone '' ( calls over the inernet ) , or are in an office environment with a PBX type system , I ca n't comment . My experience is stictly in a home office environment .	1
I bought this for my son and this is what he has to say : & # 34 ; This is a great case and held my phone waterproof on a whole cold weekend trip . My whole pack got wet and this case kept my phone dry . I would recommend this to anyone who needs tough waterproof case. & # 34 ;	1
I got this otterbox to hold my valuables at the pool this summer . It is the perfect size for what I need and it is completely waterproof and crush proof . I put some paper inside of it and held it under water and it was dry as a bone . Then I had my 100 pound son stand on it and then me at nearly 200 pounds and it did not crack .	1
very durable , water tight , use this in my backpack to keep medical supplies dry , the clamps hold tight with a solid click when shut	1
This case works great ! My wife and I are taking up kayaking and we needed some way to protect our phones . I have a samsung galaxy s2 , she has a blackberry bold 9000 . We each put our phones in our cases and immediately plunged them into the water to test to make sure they did n't leak . They worked perfectly ! My wife even flipped her kayak and that was the true test , we righted it and checked the phone , dry as can be.I recommend these , i do wish there was some padding these came with as the phones do bang around inside a bit . I 'll put my own inside , but for the price I think they could have included something .	1
I have one of these filled with charging cables ( both dock and lightning ) for iPhones and iPads , car chargers , wall chargers and everything needed to power our mobile devices while traveling ... conveniently placed and easy to grab if we 're going anywhere , knowing all the while that we do n't have to worry about forgetting anything or cannibalizing our cables from around the house . Keeps everything safe , secure and dry .	1
I do n't want to rehash all of the stuff that 's already been said about this phone . Here 's something that nobody told me before I bought it : You can not use the Infrared port on this phone to transfer data to and from it using a PC . You can use the infrared on the phone as a wireless modem for Internet connectivity ( this works for me ) but the EasyGPRS software provided to manage phone entries etc . does not work with Infrared . I 've checked out all of the online support forums for this phone and I have not heard from anyone who has actually done this . When I called tech support they suggest that I buy their data cable ( read : shell out another $ 70 ) for that purpose . It is very misleading to show this phone as being IR equipped while its use is crippled.BTW , I gave this phone 4 stars because it is still a sleek looking great phone .	1
..and I 'm from Europe , where the phones and networks are much better than in the States . I have to say that I think Samsung currently have the best software ( and I used to be a huge Nokia fan ) . Amazingly light , very intuitive , great audio , and just looks great . I recommend this without any reservations whatsoever .	1
I had the Samsung V205 and then I decided to try the E715 out . FYI to people with battery problems , with these kind of batteries , you must let it drain completely and then charge it.. kind of like building up your battery life and doing this a few times , it will improve your battery life immensely . I 've been a T-Mobile customer for a while now and I stay with them because : 1 ) They are now no . 1 in customer service , 2 ) Great rate plans , 3 ) It works great where I need it the most ! Now the additional features that the V205 did n't have that this little gadget has is:1 ) Caller ID pics.. although you wo n't be able to see it on the external display , when you flip it open , you 'll see that person 's face.2 ) The camera now has a flash as well as a zoom . And with that , it is able to take pictures in gray ( black and white ) , negative , sepia , and sketch . Also , you can do multi-shot with this as well as put lots of different kind of frames to your pictures.3 ) You can download games with the E715 whereas you can not do so with the v205 . Furthermore , the games are actually java with E7154 ) The flash can also serve as a flashlight . Which is quite useful sometimes when you do n't know where you 're walking and the light is pretty bright.5 ) Voice memo.. nuf saidOtherwise , it has the usual features . It has an alarm , calculator , calendar , to do list , MMS , SMS , you can download ringtones ( which is a big help since some of the ringtones sound pretty crappy ) , as well as games and pictures . Pretty much all the usual stuff is in this phone.. except you wo n't find bluetooth on this.Another thing is that the external display is like a blue-green thing against a black background.. which is pretty cool since you wo n't have to press a button just to see the time ... it 's always lit up so you can see it well . Also , the pictures that you can take by lookin at the external display will be a bluish-green color but when it 's saved , and you look at it , it 's in full color so no worries there.Overall , I have enjoyed this phone and no problems with it really . Another great thing is that it does n't have an annoying external antenna to get in the way so it 's a good buy .	1
And it was pretty much worth it ( if you sign the plan and get the phone for $ 250 ) . Otherwise it is a little pricey . The gain was enough to make me feel good about buying it though , and my plan was up anyway so no remorse there . It 's difficult to tell from this picture if your i95 is any bigger - but it is less bulky . The features are the same but a little better . And of course GPS is nize .	1
I 've glanced at a few reviews and looked at the overall review for this phone , and think it 's a little underrated . I 've had a couple weeks to try out mine , and the battery life with my usage is 3-4 days , and I use the phone for short calls about 5 times a day . The phone does n't squeak when squeezed , and all of the construction is tight ( even the flip screen does n't wiggle much ) . I saw a few complaints about the weight of the phone , and even a complaint about the metal battery panel . It 's called quality , sometimes quality weighs a little , and if the phone makes your pants fall down when it 's hooked onto your jeans , buy a belt . The phone employs java applications , so you can download programs to fit your needs from nextel , at a cost . You can also get them from third party sites , also ringtones , wallpaper , etc . The phone uses GPS , can locate your approximate position for free , with software it can give you directions from one location to another for free ( navigational software ) , called telenav . The quality of the speakers and microphones on this phone is great . The speakers can be loud enough to hear in different rooms of the house , or quiet enough you can barely hear them . The sound is crisp , even on direct connect . Also , an answer to the slams against nextel itself , do n't listen to it . The only problem is their tech support does not operate 24/7 , other than that their customer service is as good as any service based organization I 've ever worked with . This phone is full featured , it is n't exactly a PDA phone , but it 's software capability and 65k color screen make it perform many of the same functions as a PDA . Great phone , if nextel services your area , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
Other than the high initial cost ( I got it before they put in a promotion , duh ) , i really love this compact and stylish phone . It 's the best Nextel has offered yet , although there 's rumor that a camera phone is coming out soon . If you can wait , wait a bit longer , otherwise for walkie-talkie style cellular , Nextel is the best . No delays like with Verizon ( up to 30 seconds ! ) or Sprint ( 10 secs ) . Walkie-talkie that actually works where there 's coverage . I 'm a happy customer .	1
I have to say that this is a great phone and the Nextel service is great also.As for the review from the moron from Denver You need to have used it and the service before you open your mouth and make a fool of your self.People that review something and not have a clue just goes to show that stupid people should not breed.I have had the I90c , I95cl and the i730 and the 730 is great as for a alarm buy a clock if you need a alarm.The screen is a little smaller but the brilliant color makes up for it , the sound is as good as the other phones I have had.As for service I have had every carrier that is in the state of Colorado and Nextel is the best and for any one who is thinking of Verizon for push to talk well it sould be push to wait.If you want the best this phone and service is the best .	1
A phone which has got lots of very useful features and functions.Pros : Very Good reception . Works great inside buildings.Clear beautiful color screen and camera . One of the best out thereCons : The buttons are kind of small and needs getting used to.Little bulky if you compare it to a Samsung flip phones . But does things better than the Samsung .	1
The front screen went out on my S105 and T-Mobile wanted me to buy another phone since my warrenty was up . From the deal I 'm seeing on here , i wish i could have just canceled and got a new account , but thats too much effort ... . anywho , my choices boiled down to getting the E105 or this v300 . I chose the v300 b/c of the extra gadgets ( mainly the camera and speakerphone ) even thought the rep said samsung users have a hard time getting used to the Motorola OS.She was wrong ! Navigation of this phone was a breath of fresh air ! i will say I preferred how the phone book was layed out better in the S105 , but everything else is easier to use on this phone and the T-Zones is so much more functional ! I 'm going to have to upgrade my plan to allow more internet usage ! There also seems to be a much better seleciton of 3rd party applications and games for this phone which makes for better usability IMHO.Reception is the same as far as i can tell between the two ( meaning signal strength ) . Clarity is a tad better in the S105 , but nothing worth chosing that over this . If there is even the slightest background noise , they sound the same . The S105 and this are almost identical in size , but the E105 was smaller ... not a bid deal to me.Bottom line : If you are a prude about clarity and size , go with E105 . If you want more from a phone than just making calls , get the v300 ( or higher ) .	1
I 've been using this phone for a few months now and have had a chance to use most of the features . Most of them are pretty standard to cell phones these days , but a few things are worth commenting on : -Great speakerphone . Very loud and clear sounding , both ways.-Decent battery life . Almost lasts a week with minimal usage ; 2 days with heavier use.-Battery meter is very inaccurate below 1/2 charge . Seems chronic with Motorola phones.-Nice , clear display . A bit hard to see in the brightest sunlight , but other than that , no problems.-Camera is of average quality at best . Takes okay pictures for a new wallpaper , but that 's about it.-Serious annoyance : One of the side buttons that remain exposed when the phone is closed controls the type of ring/vibrate . It 's very loud if you do n't already have the phone on silent/vibrate only . Basically , to quickly change to phone from a loud ring to silent -- say in a theater -- you have to make a loud noise . Very short sighted . And since the button is exposed even with the phone closed , you end up hitting it by accident quite a bit.Overall , I 'm pretty happy with the phone . I could 've chosen a smaller phone with a better camera , but not with a speakerphone , or with speakerphone , but not at this price . ( ... ) Ca n't beat it on value .	1
First a quick confession : I do not like T-Mobile . I had them before and hated their ( lack of ) coverage and bad service.That said , the v300 is a very good phone . I wo n't rehash the long feature list here . What I really like ( after playing with a friend 's ) is the loud ringtones , the good reception ( despite the lack of GSM coverage in Brooklyn ) , and the great styling . This phone is not made by Motorola per se but by their Asian partner , maybe that explains the & quot ; girlish & quot ; styling , but it 's still pretty cool . Of course , the light weight and good battery life make it a stand-out.My favorite phone is still the Sanyo VM-4500 video camera walkie-talkie speakerphone cell phone for Sprint PCS ...	1
This phone was purchased with the T-Mobile plan to replace a Nokia phone with AT & amp ; T. I changed phones and service because my old phone could not get reception inside of buildings . I chose the V300 due to the external antennae . I have had the phone for two weeks now and I have been very pleased . The reception is a bit tinny sometimes , but overall I have not had any problems with dropped calls.I text message quite frequently and the phone offers you two choices for writing your text . The first is an intuitive text entry method where the phone guesses the words that you are trying to type and displays them on the screen for you to choose . This method is supposed to save time , but I have not yet gotten the hang of it . The second method is the tried and true press each button for each letter method . My only problem with the phone is that the buttons are not the same shape and are spaced apart which makes text messaging a bit trickier at first . Plus the numbers and letters which are written on the buttons are very light and I often have to shift the angle of the phone in order just to read the buttons . The light text might also be an issue for someone with vision problems.Overall , I would recommend this phone . The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I think that Motorola needs to darken the text on the buttons for those users who like to text message or who have vision problems .	1
I recently used two of the plug on a trip . I used the one for Chile and Argentina and they both worked perfectly . I would recommend this set .	1
They look cheap but work great . I took these on a trip to China and had no problems at all .	1
UPDATE : The person actually using these adapters ( an 80 year old grandma ) just reported from Bassano Italy that they worked just find and she charged her phone with no issues . So if a octogenarian can deal with something , that speaks volumes to the product ! In her case , she was using an iPhone overseas , so any issues of power converters were moot . All she had to do was plug the US style plug into the adapter . Even so , it did work for her and she did it on her own . So that is a plus ! **********************************These little adaptors look like they are well made and the price was right.i will add more when I get back !	1
Bought this for a trip to Europe ( Netherlands ) and it worked perfectly without any kinks . I am quite pleased with my purchase .	1
I was happy with this purchase . Just returned from a Europe trip where I used this to convert and charge my electronics ( Iphone , Ipad 3 ) and was very impressed.I was concerned it might fry my Ipad 3 , but I was assured by an Italian gentleman in an electronics store , that it would be just fine , and it was ! So I recommend this .	1
I bought this set of adapters specifically for a trip to Europe . There are two different Europe plugs , I took them both , and they both worked everywhere I went.I used the adapters primarily in Denmark and Norway , they worked great and gave me no problems charging iPod , iPhone , iPad , camera batteries , etc.Note that there are numbers on the plugs , the numbers correspond to the cardboard insert to let you know where to use the plugs . It would be better if the plugs themselves had that information on them , but at least they have the numbers ( which I did n't see at first so I put my own numbers on them ) .I will undoubtedly keep using the adapters on future trips , and I 'll keep this updated.Update : Have also now used in Thailand , worked great .	1
Works as it is supposed to , lightweight , compact , and very economical . Covers nearly every plug Ive ever needed in Asian except for India .	1
A few months ago , Sabrent sent me several samples of car inverters to try out , and I have been pleased with all of them so far . This review is my honest opinion.As I have mentioned in a previous review , these power inverters are not new and have been around for many years . Still , with mobile devices spreading like chicken-pox at a kindergarten , I have seen an upsurge in the amount of USB-charging inverters on the market . This particular charger offers dual USB charging ( 1A and 2.1A ports ) as well as a standard power socket . Let 's cut to the chase : this inverter functions excellently.Form is the only area I have to take issue , and it 's not Sabrent 's fault . My 2003 Subaru Outback has the AUX power ( cigarette lighter ) low down on the console , right behind the shifter , and with this inverter plugged in it 's actually quite dangerous for me to have USB cables sticking out . If you 're in the same boat as me , I highly suggest another inverter from Sabrent , also 150W : Half a star was taken off for the bulkiness of this product , another half star was taken off because I find the LED to be too bright and rather distracting during night-time driving.If you have the space , this is an excellent converter and a solid price . Recommended for most , reservations for some .	1
It 's no problem charging mobile devices while you 're driving , since these devices can be charged from a USB port , either built into the vehicle ( newer models ) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle 's power port ( aka cigarette lighter ) . But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power , and for those devices , a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer . I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers , but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop . I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru , and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power . I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger : Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop . The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running , which is well below the inverter 's limits . While using the inverter for AC devices , I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution : Every vehicle 's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle 's power port . For my Subaru Forester , the owner 's manual says this is 120 watts . Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse . I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle , but it costs about $ 300 , while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle , the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider . The inverter is also available in 150 watts ( Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC ( PW-C15U ) ) and 300 watts ( Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC ( PW-C30U ) ) .A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes .	1
Bought this thing years ago and it has n't stopped working . It was a little noisy but under the seat it was fine . I have n't used it recently because not needing it .	1
A very nice power inverter , especially for the price . Just be aware of the wattage required for what you 're trying to run . I purchased this intending to operate a coffee pot , with no result . After doing some research I find a coffee maker needs somewhere around 1000 watts to run .	1
I 'm standing in a room with a TV blasting , just 10 feet away . Talking to Hertz reservations - they tell me ( a ) my voice is the clearest one that they have heard all day and ( b ) they do n't hear the TV at all . I replace this unit with my old earphone . `` Now your voice sounds muffled '' , he said , `` and I hear that TV now loud and clear '' .I have other stories like this . Walking down a busy noisy street - the Etymonic makes my voice clear and there is no noise of traffic or wind . My old earphone almost seems to exaggerate the background noise.I use the foam ear piece and it is very comfortable and stays in place . I do n't like the hard plastic ear pieces.Nice .	1
I started using this headset two days ago . Sound is good . You can speak at a normal volume level and you will be heard . I do n't use it outside though . The earplug does give you a sense of being underwater , the way it blocks your whole ear canal . But that 's how it blocks out noise . I do think for the money there should be some sort of volume/mute control on the cable . But , I knew there was n't when I bought it . My only complaint is that it comes with a case , yet the headset does n't fit in it without bending the microphone stalk and I 'm not comfortable doing that . It 's sensitive equipment , with a filter in the earpiece that I know I 'll have to change eventually hence the included tool for same , then it should n't be left in the open to collect dust . Why not give a case that accomodates it and its accessories ? UPDATE 4/30/08 : After months of using this headset , I have to say I find it mildly annoying . You feel like you 're hearing something under water , because the thing is so jammed in your ear ( it 's a little bit violating ... ) . I would n't recommend it to anyone shopping for a headset . I really bought it because it was so hard to find a headset compatible with my AT & T ; 8525 .	1
This is by far the best wired or wireless headset I 've ever used ( over a dozen ) . It comes with a the headset , a medium length cord with 2.5mm plug , a small and large windscreen , and a 2.5mm-line in/ line out adapter for your PC and a carry case , plus 3 different sized earplugs and a cleaning tool . I use it for 4-5 hrs per day on averagePros : Very high quality speaker . Like high quality headphones , if you phone has good signal it sounds great , but you 'll hear lots of distortion with a poor signal . I use it with a blackberry 9650 and a femtocell - it is sounds as good as a high quality landline . It did n't sound as good with HTC and Samsung ( CDMA ) phones , but this is indicative of the quality of the phone 's voice circuitry.Great noise cancelling microphone - with the windscreen on , you can use it outdoors even in strong wind ( 20 mph ) . Background noise is very muted and callers are usually amazed that I am on a cell.Works with glasses and hats - unit is held in place by friction . It 's light enough so it works well . This makes it great for outdoor activities.Cord is perfect length and is designed to work with the phone on a belt clip or pants pocket . Form factor is great and it takes little space.Surprisingly , friction alone holds the unit in place . It is pretty durable too ( sitting on it or dropping it ) Cheap - for $ 35 , it performs much better than the Jawbone/Plantronics bluetooth variety without the radiation risk and outperforms high end corded headsets too ( call center sets , theBoom ) Cons:2.5mm plug . Every modern smartphone uses 3.5mm . Time for an update.Uncomfortable and itchy after extended ( 4-5 hrs ) use . The plugs are made of soft plastic so you need to air out your ear after a few hours ( no discomfort then )	1
I have a BlueParrott , but I keep forgetting to turn bluetooth on , or it is paired with something else so I 've been wishing for a wired headset with noise cancelling ability for a long while . This is it.On my motorcycle you ca n't hear the engine , and with the windscreen it is good at low speeds ( sans windshield - at 30 mph the smaller windscreen starts letting noise through . You ca n't hear my stereo blaring . I would say it is just slightly less able than the BlueParrot - but that might be because the boom does n't quite reach the corner of my mouth . But I only have problems if the noise is coming in at just the right angle.It has an isolating insert so it blocks out external noise ( you might need an earplug for the other ear in really noisy environments ) .A few nits : They should have cases for the windscreens - they tend to get squished . A stereo or dual mono version would be welcome . The boom could be a bit longer.Only negative is they do n't include an iPod/Blackberry/ ( some ) Android 4 conductor 3.5mm adapter , but I already have several . They have a VoIP adapter.So maybe not perfect , but this is way beyond all the other `` handsfree '' wired headsets I have used , and it is n't that expensive for what it does .	1
I have bought other USB hubs in the past , and they all failed . plugging in 2 powered devices would make them not work.This USB Hub I have 4 usb powered hard drives and an external DVD burner plugged in and they all work without any problems ! This is one of the best Hubs I have found .	1
This usb port is sleek and functional . It is plug and play . It even come with its own power supply in case you have power hungry peripherals . Even though it works fine for me without its own power supply I chose to use it as recommended by the manufacturer . It comes with a lifetime warranty . I have a CyperPower UPS that has been very reliable and I expect this little Cyber wonder to be nothing less .	1
Over 100 reviews all rate theCyberPower High-Speed 7-Port USB Huba good to excellent product for adding usb devices to your PC , Mac ; desktop or laptop . I do n't disagree . I think it works as promised , and is well-built by a reputable company that backs its product with a lifetime warranty . I like the solid base and the layout of the device . It 's powered ( AC ) and adds 7-ports to all my computers with plug-and-play compatibility . No driver disc or software to mess with is great . Mine is already full and it makes me wonder why I waited so long to get it ; swapping things out instead of using a hub.So what 's wrong with it ? I give this product a 4-star rating only because I ca n't shut off the blue power light , which is so bright , it illuminates my home office as well as any night-light ! Since the room doubles as our guest room , it would be great to be able to shut off that light without unplugging the device .	1
I had more USB adapters then I knew what to do with . Enter the cyberpower 7 port hub ... I am very pleased with it . I 'm not a techy , just an every day computer user . I use my hub with my iMAC and it works seamlessly , have had no issues . I bought another for a friend and she is pleased as well . Like I said , it does what it says it will do with little effort , and works quite well for the technically challenged .	1
Okay , this little guy ROCKS ! When plugged in to an outlet , it will support 2 HDDs , a external ODD , and a printer with no issues . Also , during a move I misplaced my power cord , so I called up the company ... WOW , for free , the NEXT DAY , they shipped me out a replacement . I would DEF . buy from them again , and will use more of these as the need arises.Also , it 's been quite some time now since the purchase ( over a year ) and it works perfectly like the day I got it .	1
i have use this product for 6 months it does a great job , the dlink i used on another system kept losing connection in the middle of transfers i threw it away , this one works.i use lots of usb devices and i have TWO of these on ONE computer and they work fantastic . when i copy movies to my personal video player from my network hard drives these never fail . the other ones would stop sending packets in the middle of a trasfer . i have 2 printers , 2 scanners , video capture , mouse , and keyboard , tv , external hard drives , 2 flash card readers , docking for sandisk mpeg player , docking for ipod player , external game system for updating firmware , wacom drawing board for adobe cs3 , and other attachments i hook on and off . these hubs always works.downside , ive had to learn the tricks of windows xp on keeping track of drive letters and changing them around , there are third party programs that i have tried but i 'd rather use disk manager and do it myself.you will need to do a little cable management because the unit is small and the volume of cables attached to it can physically push it around , but some cable ties or electrical take easily takes care of the problem .	1
I really like this hub . I have an Acer One Netbook , and I use this hub to power my cd/dvd external drive , my laptop cooler pad , and my 1tb external hard drive . My cooler pad also has a few usb ports , and I have a 4-in-1 memory card reader plugged into that . Everything works fine . Sometimes I have to unplug my cd/dvd drive to get the netbook to read it properly . I had that same problem with another hub though , so I think it 's the drive . It works more often with this hub than with my other though.This is very small . The main picture makes it look huge , but it 's really palm sized . I took it with me on vacation , and it fit just fine in the carry-on . You do n't need to keep the stand on it.I also like the one port in the front for when I need to plug in a usb drive .	1
I use this hub with my Mac and it is great . I just plugged into my USB port on my MacBook Pro and have never had a problem with it . You can optionally power the device with the included AC Adapter , which lights up a bunch of green lights and one brilliant blue light at the top of the green lights . This blue light is extremely bright for its size and may need to be covered if you are sleeping in the same room with it . I have plenty of open slots for additional devices . If you are using this device vertically in the stand there is a front USB slot for you to attach your flash drive without any effort . Everything ( at least with a Mac ) is recognized and ready to go once it is plugged in . I would highly recommend this hub - you ca n't find anything as nice for the price that is powered .	1
I have an older computer with ony 4 usb ports and a laptop with 2 usb ports . I have 4 external drives and a printer and various other devices that require usb , and all i have to do is disconnect it from one computer and plug it into the other and everything Works great . As far as small flash drives that require external power i have no idea . hope some reviewer will elaborate on that . In any case its well worth the money . It stays forever lit , and thats okay . It will look funny 10 years from now when the lights are extinguished .	1
Great hub . it 's a plug in , which is actually a plus because it came power larger items too . I have not had any dead usb ports .	1
This little hub seems to be the only brand that does not blow out its ports . Terrific for dental OP 's running digital equipment . Provides a local hub source for on top of the cabinet when the computer is located underneath . Easy access , works well and very inexpensive . Be sure to use the same port for the camera and the same port for the digital x ray sensor and label the ports .	1
Because of proliferation of USB based products , the USB hub is now more neccessary than ever . If you have multiple USB based devices ( printers , keyboard , mouse , flash storage , USB speakers , iphone/ipod jack etc ) and want to consolidate all your devices into a one single hub , then this hub does its job well.This devices works equally well both in Windows ( Vista ) and Mac OS ( Leopard and Snow Leopard ) .It is about half the size of a medium sized hand.Each USB port has its own dedicated LED light . The LED light indicators , however , are little brighter than I would like . It MAY bother those who are extremely light sensitive while sleeping . But a cheap way to alleviate such a problem would be to cover the LED lights with tape.I used this device as a hub for all my USB devices for my MacBook Pro ( 2009 ) and the device works flawlessly , including for my USB speakers .	1
I use this on my MacBook so I can connect several items at the same time including a USB keyboard and optical mouse , my iPad and iPhone , a webcam , an external hard drive and even a light o Rama controller for my Christmas lights . This thing works great and provides plenty of power for all devices . I have n't seen any slowness in my webcam , iPad/iPhone syncing or even copying large movies to my external hard drive . This guy works great and I am not at all disappointed in performance . I am however a bit disappointed in the design . This has to sit on the corner of my desk and i need plenty of room on both sides to allow the USB cables to plug in . I would have had them design it like a tower with the plugs all on the back one on top of another . That being said , the current design does offer some added stability to keep the hub from falling over . Overall a great performer and a decent design .	1
Does what it 's meant to do , the light in the front seems like their only for looks , their always on . Bought this for my Magic Jack , always hearing an echo & the call ID does n't always work . Echo seems to be fixed now , but still have problems with the caller ID . I also use it for charging my PS3 Sony bluetooth headset & controllers .	1
I was surprised to find this excellent powered USB hub for much less money than I paid for an identicel one over three years ago . Somehow , we misplaced the power adapter so I ordered this one mainly so I could get the power adapter . The older hub still works fine so I just use the adapter so I can run USB 3.0 Hard Drives with a TV Android mini-pc . My grandson wanted the hub for his his Playstation 3 slim , which sees a lot of use . He uses it for video gaming and for a multi-media center . He accidently damaged one of the two USB ports and he was limited by having only one USB port.I gave him this hub . He is so happy with it his friends want one !	1
It is reliable & works well with the power adapter . But with all cables plugged in it tips easy & is far too bright for bedrooms . So for the actual function it is 5stars . But for other considerations it is about 2.5 stars . So , even though it is only USB2 ( not the faster 3 ) I give it 3.5 stars .	1
I used to be a USB doubter - I thought USB would n't catch on . Was I ever wrong ! Without a hub , I would n't have enough USB ports to plug everything in ! Over the past several years , I 've gotten a number of USB hubs to handle the problem . I bought a 7-port CyberPower Hub from another vendor to use at work . It 's lasted with day in and day out use for about two years . One heavy use is that I use a password manager on a USB thumbdrive and it gets plugged in at least twice a day . The CyberPower hub at work does n't seem to mind.The hubs at home , and even the USB ports on my motherboards , seem to loosen up and not keep a good grip on the USB thumbdrive . So , when my home hub flaked out again , I decided to get a hub that I know works , and keeps on working , for use at home.The only drawback to the hub is the LED 's on it . They are a little too bright , and not really all that useful . However , it 's not a problem at work , and at home , the hub is hidden behind a monitor . I would n't want to use it in a bedroom.If you 're looking for a reliable hub , this is it .	1
I bought this one based on all the good user reviews and its popularity . I had to replace an older D-Link USB that just did n't seem to work at all on both our mac 's and PC 's ( I had two D-Link 's ) . I had hoped this Hub would actually work unlike the D-Link hub and it does the job great ! I bought two and hooked one up to the PC and the other to the Mac and plugged 7 devices into each . Everything worked and I did use the power just to make sure I could charge off of it if I wanted to . This hub works perfect and the LED 's look awesome.Very happy with this product and would buy same one if I needed another USB hub . Of course I 'm sure the 3.0 versions will soon start to proliferate but until then this is a great USB hub and priced well for what you get .	1
1 . The USB ports on the sides are spaced far enough apart that I can use all the slots . And the one in front is great for the thumb drive.2 . The lights are cool3 . It works great4 . It stands up most of the time ! when I came into the office this morning it was on it 's side but no biggie . I righted it and it was fine all day.The weighted base does make a difference and I think they made it as heavy as they could without taking away the portability feature.5 . Did I mention it works great . My laptop had no problem going to sleep . It was instantly recognized . All the devices I 've put on it have been recognized6 . I do n't know what one reviewer meant by it making noise . Mine is absolutely silent.7 . I agree you need a scissors or knife to open the clamshell packaging no biggie.I liked it so much I bought a second one ! !	1
Easy to use ... ..you can see clearly by the function lights if the unit is on and if a port is active . Have been using this now for over a year and it is still going strong .	1
Product is as good as it was advertised . It works very well and I would very much recommend this product because it would give you more usb access to your laptop or desk top .	1
Problem : It seems there 's always something else to plug in to a USB port on my laptop , but I 've long since run out of ports for plugging . In desperation , I bought a 4-port hub ( working just fine , thank you ) , but I still did not have enough ports to do the job . And the idea of daisy-chaining was not practical because my desk is already overloaded.Solution : Enter the CyberPower 7-port hub . Space-saving solution to running out of ports . And , with its own power supply , it 's not draining power from my laptop . Works like a charm ! I did find the glow light annoying , but it 's easy enough to unplug the hub when I finish working in the evening , so it 's not a big issue for me.I 'm a happy camper now , and I whole-heartedly recommend this hub for those who need more ports in a small space . I should also commend Amazon for super-fast delivery . Problem solved ! P.S . Mikey is my cat . He likes this hub and shows it by periodically knocking it off my desk.I would prefer that Mikey did n't like it !	1
This is an excelent USB port it has the option for it 's power . Ether pluged in an A/C outlet or power from your device 's nice option	1
A very good high quality USB hub . Windows recognizes everything you plug into this hub and , the USB ports are nice and tight.I will say in my opinion , for a USB 2.0 hub , the Cyberpower-CP-H720 is at the top of the quality hub chart . You can plug a DVD player or web cam into this thing and it will work perfectly . My only complaint is a lack of a method of securing it to a table top but I suppose double sticky tape will do just fine . The rubber base piece is removable so it can lay flat as well .	1
This is a great hub and has been good for several months . Highly recommend and will buy it again for additional needs .	1
ok , so this is only a USB 2.0 hub , not a 3.0 hub , but if your computer only supports USB 2 then this is all you need . Plug count/location is as follows : Along the left and right sides ( 3 per side ) It has 6 USB female type A receptacles ( this is the bigger USB connector you normally find on a PC ) On the front near the bottom , there is a 7th USB type A receptacle ( at the bottom of the unit when it 's in the stand ) a USB mini type A receptacle ( to connect the hub to the computer ) and finally on the left side there 's a power input for the external power supply.I 've had this hub in use for almost a year now and it 's held up very well to multiple plug/unplug cycles . The blue LED at the top is unnecessary to indicate power as there are the other green LEDs for each port . I 've used the plugs for keyboards , mice , HDDs and thumb drives . I 've never had any problems.Overall it a solid and small hub and recommended if all you need is USB 2.0 and up to 7 plugs .	1
[ Apart from minor issues like stability of the `` weighted '' base , this hub has been such a consistent , heavy-duty performer , while holding its price point ( just short of 30 ) for exactly 4 years , that I 've had to award it 5 stars ( and order the identical model for my wife ) . But just in the last 2 months the hub has been behaving completely opposite to expectations . It goes totally dead with my hard drives , telling me that they 're drawing too much power and therefore the hub is shutting them down until I remove them . But even when the hub is naked with the exception of a tiny flash drive , it remains dead , dark and non-communicative . It comes back to life only when I disconnect the AC power and rely on nothing more than the power supplied by the USB ports . That 's fine , but not what I need with my 1TB ( and bigger ) hard drives , which until now had been showing on my computer 's desktop with each start-up . I 'm about to call a rep in order to get an idea of what 's going on and whether there 's a fix ( could it be Apple 's latest update to OSX ? I 'll be back pending further info . ] I realized I needed a 7-port hub and checked out the D-Link , Kensington , Belkin -- the usual suspects . Then I chanced upon this unlikely contender , looking more like a jukebox in Amazon 's picture than a hub . I was intrigued by the off-beat design and noticed that the price was competitive ( though a couple of the others are presently offering rebates , a free flylight , and other sweeteners ) . Now that I 'm looking at the CyberPower USB port `` in person , '' I can provide a few initial impressions:1 . It 's a lot smaller than the picture might imply . Compactness is nice , but you also want a hub that will stay put and that allows sufficient space between adjacent plugs.2 . Although the hub is designed for either vertical or horizontal use , the added and welcome weight of the detachable base makes vertical use the more sensible option . Otherwise , you 've got a lightweight ( and fairly generic ) loaded-up plug which could easily move around , dislodging the USB mini-plug ( a necessary evil except for small cameras ) at one end of every USB 2.0 cable.3 . It seems to handle my equipment off of the USB power supplied by the computer , but I still breathe easier using the included AC power adapter . ( To the manufacturer 's credit , it 's one of the slimmer , lighter wall-warts that I 've seen. ) 4 . The flash drive mount is practical ( but not unique ) . Now I can finally use that old Sandisk thumb drive that formerly was taking up the space of two USB ports.5 . The individual port lights are on all the time and , unlike most hubs , are not indicative of the presence or absence of a USB device.In conclusion , it 's a reliable performer and a convenient as well as eye-catching device -- providing you go for the vertical look . If I were to suggest one design improvement , it would be to `` fatten up '' the tower so that it would be wide enough to permit horizontal insertion of USB devices with the hub in vertical position . Doing so would assure unforced accommodation of all your USB plugs , even the most space-devouring ones . Biggest `` gripe '' : the vertical design is not real stable . The hub is easily dislodged from the base and bounces around quite a bit . If I had to do it over , I 'd look at the heavy , dome-shaped Kensington . [ Revaluation after almost 3 years : I tried the Kensington . It was no more stable but less reliable . So I returned to the CyberPower , but without the base or vertical position . I velcroed its back side to the wooden surface behind my desktop machine , with printer and two 500GB storage drives inputted to the rear , one USB cable from the front side to the USB of my iMac , and a flash drive connected to the top side of the hub . Absolutely no problems . This item continues to rise in both popularity and price because it 's so good . Should it ever fail , I doubt there 's any other hub available that could surpass it . Forget the `` cuteness '' factor ; this thing is all business . ] [ 4 years later : This `` off brand '' hub continues to be an Amazon best-seller while hubs like the Kensington `` round mound '' have fallen off the map , so this one is a proven winner . Only lately I 've had some difficulty with getting it to recognize really large ( 1TB ) hard drives . Before condemning the drive , I going to try some different cables and maybe a call to the manufacturer . Otherwise , the next step up would be either a 3.0 USB hub or a hub with dedicated switches , permitting you to assign just the power-draining devices to the AC-powered inputs while allowing the other devices ( iPods , mouse receivers , flash drives , printers , etc . ) to run sheerly on USB power . ]	1
This is a really nice USB 2.0 hub . It works way better than the 7-port DLink it replaced . The LED lights are a bit bright , but for me it 's not much of an issue since the hub lives down on the floor in my setup . I agree that it would be nice to be able to to turn them off though if it 's too bright , just cover over them with a strip of tape-problem solved.I am impressed with this hub and would recommend it.Note-it is actually smaller than it looks in the pictures .	1
My my newLogitech G11 Gaming Keyboard ( Black/Silver ) did not work when I plugged it onto myD-Link DUB-H4 High Speed USB 2.0 4-Port Hub . After researching a bit , I bought the CyberPower one and now the keyboard works fine . In fact , lots of other usb things now work without being plugged directly into the computer . I 'm quite happy with it .	1
I needed a self powered USB 2 hub for my iMAC , and selected the CyberPower.It works as advertised and comes with its own plug-in power supply . I can leave my Palm TX hooked to it even when the computer is off and it will charge it . The only drawback is that the thing is loaded with eight LED 's and they stay on whenever it 's powered either by the computer or by its own power source . If you have the thing in your sleeping area and are light sensitive , you 'd have to unplug it .	1
This device is wonderful , very light weight and portable and works excellent . I purchased as a replacement USB hub for use on my laptop and very much like that you can tuck it anywhere easily . Great quality product .	1
I 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it . The only disappointment so far has been battery life . Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I do n't really talk on it that much.Why is this phone so great ? Simple . It has it all . This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , USB connector and a speakerphone.If you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you .	1
OPERATION : It 's like BMW 's I-Drive - It does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface . For example , the memory card is under the battery . The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card ... and turning the phone back on takes a little while . This is representative of the entire phone operation . Not for the impatient.If you 've never used an advanced mobile phone before , you might assume this is par for the course , but it simply is n't . Even the instruction booklet is out of order.APPLICATIONS : It has lots of applications and they work very well ... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open . No matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications . On the other hand , one may leave many applications open at once , hide them and return to them just where they left off - similar to a Mac . Me likes.The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone , Camera ( VGA/zoom/night mode/timer ) , Video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , Speaker ( good sound ) , Bluetooth , infrared , Modem for computers , electronic wallet , Internet access , Calendar , calculator , converter and more.The phone does not have an Mp3-player , FM radio , 200k+ color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , PDA , photo editor . I 'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet . ... I 'm not sure I 'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device , anyhow.DEPENDABILITY : I 've seen no glitches . I 've had no problems w/ this phone.STYLING/ERGONOMICS : The keys are small , which generally does n't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing.As for appearance , well , that 's subjective . Few will look at the phone and know it 's 'all that ' . It 's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung . Less Benz/obvious ; more Audi/understated.Although it has chubby hips , the device is n't really so big . Solid , squeak-free , large screen.MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless . First of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc . Secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires . Still not sure ? If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer , there is a memory card w/a good deal of storage as well . This is no small deal . If you 're still whining about storage , deleting some games will free-up still more memory.RECEPTION : This really depends on locale & carrier . The 6600 ( T-Mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including New Zealand and Australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from Cingular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) . The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries , excluding New Zealand and Australia . The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas . As the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620.The battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness . Remember , this phone uses an operating system - Symbian ... and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors . It films 10 second video , for crying out loud . The battery life ca n't be very long ; let 's not be greedy.GAMES - Java . Do n't use them , so I delete them for addtl space . In my humble opinion , games , along w/ 'flip phones ' belong in the hands of teenagers.IMP : Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia 's site . There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost . The downloads are for basic and advanced operations.The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone . If you expect to be able to pick things up when you 're out and in a rush via common sense , many times you 'll end up frustrated . A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you ... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price . Keep in mind that for nearly every screen , there are a number 'along side ' and 'beneath ' them ... for every 'save , ' there are choices of phone memory , memory card or sim card.Despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) ... does more than most ... does it well ... is dependable . It 's a high-line Audi , on a Cadillac suspension , at a reasonable price.When you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that is n't easy to out-grow.I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded ... or those who simply do n't need so many features .	1
Its been 11 months now that I 've held on to my Nokia 6600 for . I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available . I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time . I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held . It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.Now I 'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I 'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer . My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610 . I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone . Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad2 . The looks are absolutely no nonsensical . Some complain it being a tad too bulky looking . I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be3 . The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface . There 's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed . The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature . I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages , take a thousand pictures and videos . Capacity is not a problem here.4 . The Build is just right . The phone is sturdy . I 've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever . Its a tough one this unless you wan na drive your car over it . This is n't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gon na play aeroplane with this , are you.5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome . I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth . The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary . The use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phoneBesides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality . It has great upgradibility . I can play MP3 files on my phone by simply downloading softwares freely available on the net . Now that is neat . The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving . I would n't do that because it 's not worth my life.Anyhow some demerits of this phone , The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use . Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds . You can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved.Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone . When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought did n't please me . In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied . This makes for a great phone.Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth ? gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS !	1
I have been waiting to finish my 1 year contract to get this phone . i did find some bad reviews about 6600. but let me tell you folks its a awesome phone . I have a Palmone T3 and i am really having a good time with both now . neeed to try sync option soon . over all i am much satisfied . giving 4 stars cause the keys are placed little odd . thanks nokia	1
For the money these are great . I use these for a home based business and they get a years worth of abuse in a month . That being the case one will last me between 3-18 months then the wire will develop a break ( normal ) but at these prices I can toss the bad and replace on the cheap .	1
Jabra makes , by far the best hands-free devices on the market . The EarWave Boom is a good model that will satisfy 90 % of people who need hands-free functionality for their cell phones.Jabra has gotten away from the full molded ear gels for this model . I personally prefer them to the mini ear gels , but this unit fits fine in your ear with the ear wrap-around . It 's comfortable and works fine.As for the hands-free jack on your phone , you have to make sure you have a 2.5 millimeter jack . That is the one with 2 stripes on the plug . Calling this `` Universal '' is a little bit of an overstatement , but with a little research you can verify which model fits your phone . Unfortunately , a specific compatibility list is hard to come by . Look at the specs for your phone and give it a try.The microphone will capture sound just fine . For those who experience a lot of interference or muffling , I recommend you try the version with `` Noise Cancelling . '' It 's about $ 7 more but for certain models of phone the difference can be worth it.The Jabra EarWrap has a slightly better wraparound attachment and a slightly longer arm . For those who do n't like the microphone arm , the Jabra EarWave Bud does n't have a microphone arm , but instead has the small mic on the cable with a clip to attach it to your tie or shirt . Personally I do n't like those models.I have not found much difference in sound quality between the different Jabra models . The differences are mainly in comfort , style , and ease of use . This product is decently priced , but I think it could be more affordable.Try other higher end models if you are more demanding , like I am , and are willing to spend the money . This is a pretty good model though , definitely enough to satisfy most users .	1
Good , I was happy with this product . I got tired of accidentally keeping my bluetooth earpiece in my jean pockets and sending them through the wash , so I bought this and it worked great until I bought a car that had bluetooth built-in .	1
I got this because I had to use a non-Bluetooth cell phone for a while and I prefer talking hands-free.PROS : Confortable . Very good sound quality . Cheap . Fits in my ear well enough that I 'm able to keep the phone volume very low and still hear just fine.CONS : Corded.I 've since gotten my Bluetooth phone back , but still keep this around in case the Bluetooth has problems .	1
Used this to replace an original with an old cell phone . You ca n't beat the price and lasted years . Thanks .	1
The Pros : The function and design of this headset are first rate . Right out of the box it was easy to pair with my Motorola v505 phone.It is small and unobtrusiveThe battery life is really good in standby mode , and lasts several hours of talking . ( and it does issue warning tones when the battery runs low , plus the phone issues a message saying `` headset signal weak - switch to handset ? `` The combo belt clip/charger is a really cool idea . It would have been EVEN COOLER if Jabra had made it compatible with nokia , Moto , and Ericsson phone chargers . Now I have yet ANOTHER power supply to drag with me on trips ... .Reception is very good as long as line of sight is unobstructed by anything full of water . I can pump gas in my car with the phone on the passenger seat or wander all over my hotel suite waving my arms wildly while the phone sits in its charging stand on the desk . If there is a body in the way ( or an aquarium , etc ) then the signal drops off ( attenuates ) dramatically . In fact , there is a marked difference between putting the phone on the opposite side of your body from the earpiece when carrying your phone in your pocket . If on the opposite side , the signal degrades noticeably.The Cons : I have been unsuccessful getting it to pair with either my laptop or my PDA however ( an HP iPaq 4155 ) .If you have a bluetooth PDA and use BT to Activesync with your PC , it will interfere with this headset while it is `` connected '' ( from Activesync 's perspective ) . You will hear a constant `` crackling '' noise that sounds like the other person is popping popcorn . It took me a while to figure out . You do n't have to turn off the BT radio on the laptop or PDA , just `` disconnect '' the BT session temporarily while talking . This is a hassle , but not a killer ( one of the reasons for 4 instead of 5 stars ) My biggest problem with the unit is that it does not fit my ears without feeling very insecure . The `` hanging '' design always feels like it is flopping around for me , and if I lean too far to that side , the unit will actually fall off my ear . There is no way to tighten the fit of the unit ; I have already tried different earpieces and positions of the earpieces , but this does n't help . This is the reason why I will probably replace this unit with another . Its a shame , since it is such a nice unit , but the floppiness on my ears is unacceptable.BTW , I am not a midget - I am 5 ' 10 and weigh 160 lbs . I have a fairly narrow face , but I think the bigger issue is that I have small earlobes . If you have small earlobes ( rather than pendulous ones ) you may want to test fit this unit in a store before buying one here . I wish I had ...	1
I received this little gem for Christmas and now I refuse to speak into the phone itself . This BT enabled unit is the perfect gift for anyone with a cell phone.No more complicated setups . As soon as I turned this on , my Nokia found it , recognized it , associated it , and I was speaking into it.The battery life is great and the clarity is also dead on.Once you use this product , you too will never go back to speaking into your phone the old fashioned way .	1
I 've been using my Jabra headset for a couple of weeks and have been very pleased with it . I bought it primarily for use while driving . It 's very comfortable to wear . It has performed extremely well in the car . At times , I 've used it at home . The range of the headset is quite good , but I get more static in my apartment . From time to time , I lose connection with my phone . I suspect that it 's more a problem with my phone than with the headset ... I only wish that the phone would come with a charger for the car as this is where I ( and perhaps most people ) will use the headset . In any case , I can highly recommend the Jabra headset .	1
I bought 2 of these headsets ( one for me and one for the girlfriend ) on recommendation by my Cingular sales guy . It was either the BT250 for $ 80 or the Moto HS810 for $ 99.Not knowing too much about Bluetooth headsets at the time , I opted for the BT250 . Two weeks later and I 'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear , but I 'm sure most , if not all , Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience . The other minor inconvenience are the buttons ; they do n't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it 's one thing I would REALLY like , then it 's a replaceable [ rechargeable ] battery . I 'd really hate to buy a new headset just because the battery will no longer hold a charge.Regardless , I have found the BT250 to be a better value than the HS810 .	1
I owned two versions of this unit . One with the Nokia 3650 ( apparently the 3650 requires a specific type as compared to some of the other BT phones ) and the second one that I currently own is with the Motorola V600.This comparison will cover both Jabra units and will compare them to the Nokia HDW-2 Blutooth adapter as well as the Motorola HS-820 bluetooth adapters.The jabra unit boasts a much better design . The other two sit on the ear and feel extremely awkward . The jabra design provides a much better and more comfortable fit even with glasses on . the other two has flimsy over the ear plastic pieces that feel very out of place.I felt this unit to be relatively easier to use as compared to the other two . I had NO problems teaming either of the units with the 3650 . I did have to jump through a few hoops to team with the V600.THE most important reason I wanted a BT adapter in the first place was to due to the fact that i get a phone signal in my liviing room and there is no signal at my desk in the basement which is directly under the living room . The reception was about the same for both ( not use-able ) . I also noticed that when I went around the corner , I would lose the signal . true for all units.All in all , I would rate each one as follows on a scale from 1 to 5 : Quality : jabra-4 , Nokia-3 , Motorola-2.5Design : Jabra-5 , Nokia-1 , Motorola-1usabaility ( range ) : Jabra-3 , Nokia-3 , Motorola-3usability ( ease of use ) : Jabra-4 , Nokia-3 , Motorola-3Overall : Jabra-4 , Nokia-2 , Motorola-2One thing i did not get to test was the battery life . Jabra did provide a good two and a half days of battery time with a single charge . i did not get to test the battery life of either Nokia or Motorola units .	1
Paired with a nokia 6230 . Awesome headset . The battery life is pretty long . It feels really light on your ear and the sound is excellent.Some of these people must be going deaf or something because this thing can get loud . I never have the volume at max when I use this . And if this thing feels heavy on your ear , you must have ears the size of nickels . Or you 're using two of them on the same ear ... i do n't know.Whenever I use this I sometimes forget I have them it until the unit rings ... which makes me twitch because I 'm not expecting a ring blasting thru my ear.I hate : -wind noise . You ca n't carry a conversation when you 're driving with the windows down . or walking and the wind blowing in your face.-voice dialing may or may not work.-it makes my phone hang and reset . but that could be a phone problem in general.-30 feet ? more like 10 . 15 at best .	1
I 've had this headset for about a month now and at first I was very satisfied . I like the shape , it 's comfortable enough to wear all day ( and I wear it from 7:30 a.m. to about 9:00 p.m. ) , and the battery lasts almost forever . The headset loads into the charger like a knife into its sheath . The charger even has an accessory belt clip so you can carry it with you as a holster for the headset . The sound is loud and clear unless you drive with your windows down , and the ear gel can be adjusted to put the sound right where you want it . So why 4 stars ? My only complaint is that aside from being wearable on either ear , this headset is totally NOT adjustable . Perhaps the shape of my face and/or ear is unusual , but the earpiece keeps pulling away from my ear . Add to that the fact that the headset wants to work itself off my ear entirely , and the lack of adjustability is a problem for me . Lest anyone wonder , I 'm not a small person and my ears sit stylishly flat against my head.I solved the foregoing problems by cutting a heavy duty paperclip to length , bending it into the appropriate shape , and taping it to the headset with electrician 's tape . Then I bent the wire so that the earpiece fits snugly into my ear . As a bonus , the tape adds a little extra bulk around the upper loop of the headset , which helps hold everything in place . Problem solved , but why not engineer some adjustibility in during design ? I 'd still buy it , no problem there , but I ca n't give it five stars because the lack of built-in adjustibility is , to me , a definite oversight .	1
I picked up this headset the other day and I 'm relatively pleased with it . Despite a few bad reviews , the sound quality is acceptable for making telephone calls and dicatation , though the sampling rate is obviously too low to listen to music with it . I easily paired it with a Sony-Ericsson t68i and my 15 '' Powerbook running Mac OS X 10.3.8.My quick testing with iChat AV was positive and it seems quite usable for use with an iSight for the voice portion of a call . I also was able to set the sound output to the headset and am currently listening to some music with it , but the low sample rate and the fact that it is n't in stereo makes this only a novelty . Nevertheless , it is still useful when a real pair of headphones are not available.The range , as mentioned in other reviews , is n't amazing , but was sufficient to move about an average-sized room and worked intermittently through a cinder block wall.It fit fairly comfortably on my ear and seems to easily hide , though is a bit cumbersome to put on at first . The multiple earpieces are also a plus . The dual charger/belt clip is an interesting idea , but seems to be poorly executed . It seems somewhat unstable , so I 'm not sure I 'd actually keep it on my belt . However , it might not be bad for riding around clipped to something inside of my backpack.All in all , it 's not a bad device , though there is certainly some room for improvement . I 'd probably buy it again , having used it for a little while .	1
The light works exactly as expected . As long as you are using your headset then the light will indicate that you are on the phone . I do wish that the lights were a little brighter , or possibly multicolored . We have an individual in the office that is color blind to red , so that would have been a nice touch.Also for obvious reasons , if you are using your handset , this light is not on . I wish that the lifter had a feature that recognized when the handset was lifted by hand . But that is a wish , not a product defect.Overall , I am happy with this device .	1
Plug it in , stick it high on the wall above you , tape a Post-It `` ON PHONE WHEN LIT '' and you 're done.Nobody 's bothered me since ! The nice thing is even lifting the headset from the cradle activates the lights , so I can choose to avoid being disturbed even when I 'm not on the phone .	1
If you do n't have your own office and/or you have co-workers who have a tendency of indiscriminately interrupting , pointing to flashing lights will effortlessly embarrass them into not interrupting you when you are on the phone ! In my case I bought the light as a courtesy to my co-workers ; I am the first one in the office to wear a headset and they were uncomfortable approaching me whenever I was wearing it . Now there is no question whether I am on the phone or not . Easy to install , plug into lifter and place for greatest visibility ( cord is about 5 feet long , secure with screw or double stick `` squares '' ) .	1
This item is awesome . The two drawbacks are:1 ) The random light patterns are just weird , I wish I could set it to just one pattern , or to just blink regularly , or to just be on when the phone is engaged.2 ) Plantronics ' website lists this as compatible with all of their wireless headsets , however it is not compatible with their CS60-USB . So when I moved to a soft-phone , I had to give up this gem .	1
Easy to use and set up , works reliably , but in my workplace people walk in and see me facing away from the door , do n't notice the light and start talking to me while I 'm on the headset . I 'd like to see Plantronics come out with a brighter or larger LED version , but otherwise , it works as advertised ... now about those darn co works that do n't pay attention to it , I do n't know how to fix that !	1
The only thing was that I wish the cable was like 5 ft longer . It does n't exactly reach where I want it to go with out an extension .	1
I tried a yagi antenna with my repeater , but never got a signal . I finally put this up on my metal ( ground plane ) roof . 2 or 3 bars inside , even though a phone outside in the same place has only 1 bar . Downgraded some because everything Wilson makes requires an adapter to plug into something else . Be sure you get the right adapter .	1
I needed a second antennae for my Wilson Sleek cell booster so I could leave one with my vehicle and the other at my weekend residence for convenience . This antennae matched with the Sleek booster exceeded my expectations for strengthening a weak cell signals where I often find myself .	1
This was definitely easy to install . It can be removed and transferred from one vehicle to another . Adds just enough gain to work great .	1
Very please with the antenna but had to buy extra adaptor for it to fit my booster . Should have a bit more info .	1
This headset was purchased to replace TWO crappy jabra freespeaks . This is very small , but unlike the goldlatern bluetreks or the Jabra , does not hide its mass well ; it all sits right outside your ear , and in completely inconspicuous . With my old bluetrek and even the jabra , my hair hid most of it , which for me is a plus , as I do not use Bluetooth headsets to impress people or get atttention ; I do n't want peoples attention and questions.Which is this headsets only drawback - it has this HUGE , BLUE ORB-LIKE LIGHT on it that takes up the whole front of the piece . YOU WILL ATTRACT ATTENTION with this headset on . It blinks in standby , it blinks when in operation , it blinks all the dang time . But , if you can get passed that , it does work pretty well . The sound is a little tinny , but pretty clear . And unlike all my other bluetooth headsets , the headset volume only operates the headset , and does n't link to the phone volume - this means that you have more adjustability for volume level and loudness , which is good . The mic seems really good - no complaints from those on the other end , basically . And the battery life is n't TOO ugly at 5 hours . And the ear anchor could be a little more rigid and smaller for smaller ears , but it will do as long as you are not jogging around constantly .	1
This product appears to be a genuine original equipment Blackberry car charger . It has the Blackberry name and logo on it . The plate on the bottom of the cigarette lighter plug of the unit states that the electric output is 5 volts , 500mA ( 500 milliamperes or .5 ampere ) . The plate on the wall charger packaged with a new Blackberry 8800 states that the wall charger output is 5 volts , .75 ampere . Thus , it appears that the car charger produces two thirds the electrical charge produced by the wall charger ( .5 vs. .75 amp . ) This car charger is used with a Blackberry 8800 and has performed admirably and without any problems . It costs a fraction of the price charged by AT & T ; ( $ 29.99 ) , apparently for the same product .	1
Since BB battery does not last too long , I plug in my BB car charger into my BB every time I 'm in my car . This keeps my BB charged all day long . A must for every BB owner out there .	1
Love it works great never had a issue with it at all would buy a million more ifi needed them	1
It works fine . I like it if I have any problems I will update you .	1
I have been using my Blackberry Curve for almost 2 years and only 3 times have I been able to run the battery to empty in one day . This car charger works as you would expect it to so if you 're more addicted to your Blackberry then I am ( and I am fairly glued to mine ) this charger will keep your thumbs moving even longer then they probably should : ) .	1
I bought this to fit inside a kit that creates a storage space below my car stereo . The pad has good grip on an ipod , my phone , and a couple pens while sticking to the smooth plastic .	1
These things are great and work for a lot of areas , not just the car . I actually use them on my art table to keep my items from moving that I use .	1
works great	1
Not only is this sticky pad great to keep things from sliding but you can trim it to fit an area or 'shelf ' on the dash .	1
This pad is really good it works for the porpuse that is described , obvisly of you put something really big or something too round , it is going to fall with any movement of the car , but for the phone , glases , coints , some small papers , etc . it works and is really easy to remove and replace in any part of the car board . Highly recomendable.Note : It also looks nice in black car boards .	1
Nice sticky pad to keep my phone and glasses from sliding across the dash when I turn . How many time have i done that when i take them off to look for a paper or phone charger when driving . Its a bad habit but so is reaching for the glasses across the car and still be driving , but no more .	1
I put this sticky pad on top of a cup holder cover i have on my Honda Accord 2010 . I tend to put ipods or my cellphone there and whenever the car moves it slides out and falls to the car 's floor . Using this sticky pad , it prevents that for me.It is easy to remove if you decide to get rid of it altogether . You do n't have to stick it permanently on any part of your car.Things that do n't bother me about it but should be noted.It does n't stay on the cover that well.Its like it could fall off if there was enough dust between it and the cover.Just like any other sticky thingie , this thing can easily collect dust . It looks like you can just wash it off though . I have n't tried.Update : Yep you can just pull it off , wash it , dry it properly ( overnight ) and put it back where it was.I bought a 2nd one so that I can put stuff on the dashboard now . So I can use the cupholder .	1
I always have triable keeping my phone from moving when in my sports car . I like to keep my phone close to my hands and this sticky pad allows me to do exactly that even when I make a sharp turn . The phone alway stays in place . If it gets a bit dusty , you can wash it and is as good as new again .	1
Works as advertised . It 's a tacky pad that is non-adhesive and keeps stuff from sliding around on the dashboard . Problem with the iPhone ( 4S ) is that the back is a flat panel of Gorilla Glass and does not lift easily off the Sticky Pad . Instead , it tends to lift the Sticky Pad off the dashboard by sticking itself to the back of the iPhone . I 'm sure the problem would be solved by using an iPhone cover , but then if I did I would n't need the Sticky Pad at all .	1
I did take off a star in the rating because products like these are marketed in a slightly exaggerated way.There 's nothing & # 34 ; sticky & # 34 ; about the product . The pad is made of a specific material that is able to hold the objects in place while you 're driving . It 's not perfect , but for the simple task of holding a cellphone , sunglasses , loose change , perhaps your EZ-Pass , it will do the trick.I place a camcorder there to film road trips , and for the most part , it stays put . Like any other product of this type , if you off-road , drive over unpaved roads , or you intentionally drive abnormally , the contents of the pad may not stay put.Summary : Just drive normally , and you wo n't have a problem .	1
I keep one of these at my office desk and one at home . It provides a great place to locate my cell phone or bluetooth stereo speaker . No clanging when I lay the items down . No strange echo vibrations from hard surfaces . AND no vibrating off the counter - which had happened before without the pad .	1
She used to keep her cell in the side door pocket and was always missing calls & messages , but problem solved.Has never fallen off .	1
I bought a similar one @ a local store & was surprised how well it held my phone , my sons phone & iPod . I pd almost $ 6 & it is 1/2 the size of this one . I needed another one & it looked bigger . Wow ! ! It 's bigger , I have a . Portable fan even on one of these ! ! I loved it so much , I bought another one . WARNING ... . This has NOTHING to do w/ the product itself , BUT if u use this for your phone , iPod & it 's HOT outside & u have this on ur dashboard ... DO NOT put your phone or iPod on it ! ! My phone over heated ! ! ! ! Thank goodness it ok my phone ... . But u live & learn . I also keep loose change on it ... Glasses ... Small toys stay too ! ! ! ! Enjoy ! !	1
Like so many other reviewers , I had this Think Outside Stowaway `` collecting dust '' as I had bought it for an older phone . I was actually looking on Amazon for a foldable keyboard and came across this and these reviews . So I found my Stowaway ( quicker than I thought I might ! ) , did not load the software that came with it ( as the instructions tell you to do ) , but just decided to see if it would sync with my Playbook . First , of course , I had to put 2 AAA batteries in it and , VOILA , it worked ! ! ! I am a happy camper ! ! ! As another reviewer said , it is surprising that some other manufacturer has n't continued this concept in folding keyboards .	1
I just paired this with my Hisense Sero Pro and it works great . I 've tried many portable keyboards but none with this build quality and keyboard comfort . Truly feels like a real keyboard that folds up small . The stand holds my 7 inch tablet well . No more lugging around my laptop . This is all I need .	1
I bought this keyboard when it was first released back in 2005 took it out today to test it with the idea of selling it . But after installing it on my current device ( Verizon XV6800 running Windows Mobile 6.1 ) , I decided I liked it too much to sell . I forgot how much I liked this keyboard . I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of two annoyances:1 . The numbers are accessible only through function keys - a bit of a pain . I would have preferred another row of keys . It would n't have added that much size or weight.2 . When the keyboard is open , it 's supported in the middle by what becomes the case and the ends extend on either side like wings . If you are a slow typist , this is fine . But I 'm a fast typist and I tend to hit the the keys pretty hard so the keyboard tips from side to side when I type . Really irritating . I fixed this by making two little supports from stacked cardboard glued together . I stick these under the `` wings '' and that solves the problem.Here 's where I got the latest driver released for the device ( it 's no longer supported by iGO ) : [ ... ] This driver is for Windows Mobile 5 , but it works on my Mobile 6.1 device . : ) You MUST install the driver in MAIN MEMORY - not a storage card . If you install it on a storage card , it wo n't work.After I installed the driver , the configuration utility suggested that I upgrade the keyboard 's firmware . I thought this would n't work since the keyboard is no longer supported by iGO , but to my surprise , it did - my firmware was updated from 1.1 to 1.2.The previous reviewer said he had to use the pointing stick to send email . That 's because he did n't know the keyboard shortcut for Send : Alt-S.The keyboard folds up very small and compact and it 's very light-weight - not a big deal to carry it around along with my SmartPhone . No more picking at the tiny on-screen keyboard when I want to send email from my phone !	1
This is a great Bluetooth keyboard that is very compact and easy to use . It does work for Android and iDevices and has a shelf for you device to rest on so you can see the screen while you type .	1
The iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard is truly portable . Running on two AA batteries , you can easily carry spares around . Only gripe about this product is that it lacks a dedicated number row ( for 1 to 0 ) . Else , it would be perfect .	1
I just love this keyboard . I 've used it with my HTC and now with my unlocked iphone using BTstack Keyboard from Cydia . The only issue is that it really needs an extra row of keys . The numbers and symbols are placed on the top row of letters ( where the letters QWERTYUIOP are in the keyboard ) . To access a number , you need to press the left function key and the corresponding letter . To type a symbol , you need to press the right function key and the corresponding letter . I work in finance and many of my annotations need numbers and symbols , like 10 % for example . For that , it takes a long time . I find it easier to type `` ten pc '' instead of 10 % .I 'll buy a new keyboard just for that . But besides this , the keyboard is just amazing . So if you do n't need your numbers and symbols too often , I really recommend it .	1
First off , I have had this product since 2007 and was fortunate to catch it at a great bargain ! ! Since then , I have not had one problem with it except when I forget to change the batteries ! I have been able to successfully pair and use this keyboard with originally a Samsung I760 , then a HTC Touch Pro 2 and now my Motorola Xoom tablet . I was surprised that I did n't even have to download drivers , it worked once I simply paired it.Not having number dedicated keys was a sacrifice but I can type memos , emails or simply work on a novel at anytime conveniently by having this portable keyboard . The keyboard itself is very durable and has a sturdy feel when you are typing .	1
Great sturdy design in every aspect . After pairing , it features flawless instant connection to your device every time you open it . A keeper for long , its quality shows it 'll last for ages.I just wish iGO would start working on supporting Windows Mobile 6 . It does perform as a keyboard should and it does carry out it 's core functionality ; but , I ca n't find the drivers for my device or any other WM6 device for that manner . I am currently using similar ones which , though do allow the device to work , do n't allow all function keys to carry their purpose or softkey support to be accurate .	1
I have infrared ( IR ) keyboards to use with my Palm Treo 650 and Palm TX . They do n't work very well , at least not for me . I had major problems with lag : characters I typed simply did n't make it to the screen.Taking a chance , I bought the Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard . . . and I am very , very impressed.Set-up is very quick and Stowaway 's set-up software is simple to use . Reading the short user 's manual ( not the brief Quick Start ) is a must . The learning curve is n't steep , but because the keyboard is intended as a `` universal '' device , tweaks have to be made for using it with Palm or Pocket PC devices.Once set up , the keyboard performs superbly well . Every key I struck showed up immediately onscreen . I have large hands and I was concerned that I would encounter many typos because of my large fingers . I need n't have worried . The keys have a firm touch and the spacing is wide enough to keep typos to a miniumum . Because of the immediate feedback provided by Bluetooth , I felt no tendency to go back and retype because the character did n't show up . I had no idea that the IR keyboard with its lag was causing me to do that so much.Others have commented about instability because the ends of the keyboard are essentially unsupported . At first this struck me as a design flaw , but within a few minutes this is easily compensated for . I had little difficulty with my keystrokes causing the keyboard to rock.Some have also complained about devices slipping off the minimal stand provided . I had no problems with the Treo 650 or Palm TX.Finally a number of people have complained that there is no fifth row for entry of numbers . You have to use a function key + number combination or you can set the keyboard to number lock . If you have to enter a lot of numeric data , the complaints are justified . On the other hand , for people like me who have limited need for numeric entry , it is an inconvenience , but not a major one . I 'm happy to trade a fifth row for numerics for the small size of the unit.Construction of the unit is typical for many of today 's products . It 's plastic with some metal , but overall it does not feel like it is built like a tank . On the other hand , it does n't feel overy flimsy either . Time and use will tell how well the unit stands up.Overall , this unit makes it eminently possible to use handheld devices like the Treo 650 and Palm TX for serious typing . I was surprised to find that I could type almost as rapidly on this keyboard as I can on a full-sized unit . The Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard is a very slick piece of work and well worth the cost for anyone who wants to use their smartphone or PDA for typing more than a few words .	1
Once you get a keyboard for your pda / smart phone , you wo n't go back . This keyboard communicates via bluetooth and does a great job at turning your small device into a productive tool you wo n't want to be without . I use this keyboard with my Palm TX and it does a fabulous job during meetings - it 's small ( smaller than a notebook ) , VERY portable and reliable . the entire keyboard as well as my Palm PDA fits into the pant pocket of my cargo pants / shorts . You really ca n't get much more portable than that.To use you invoke a 3-button key combination to help it initiate contact with your device . Once connected , you 'll be off and running . My Palm TX will only stay on at 1-3 minute intervals so the only thing I do n't like about this combination is that I have to keep hitting a key once in a while so my Palm does n't shut off . This of course is a design flaw of the TX and not reflective of the keyboard .	1
This keyboard fills my left pocket and my `` Ultra mobile PC phone '' fills my right pocket . This keyboard allows me to type at normal speed on a device I can keep in my pocket , and I was astonished to see that it would have even worked for text messaging on my older phone , the Nokia N-Gage . If you have any HTC phone or any phone that supports bluetooth or this keyboard , or even a PDA , I highly recommend this product , although it is costly . Pair it with anything that can run TextMaker Office for WindowsMobile and you have a meeting powerhouse in your pocket that can tackle the best college note taking in a much more mobile manner than a laptop , since you do n't need to take it out of a bag , plug it in , and otherwise waste time . I also suggest pairing it with the mouse by the same company for the same purpose .	1
I have an older PDA ( Dell Axim X50 ) and this keyboard works great ! The connection is Bluetooth and was easy to set up . It is compact when folded up and very light , yet feels fairly sturdy and responsive when typing .	1
The iGO bluetooth keyboard works great . The only complaint is the extreme left and right tips a little when typing .	1
For the money , this is a great item and a must have for mobile road warriors . I am using the iGo keyboard with a Blackberry Curve ( 8300 ) .Like others have said , there is a nasty sticker that covers both the outside cover and the keys that may never completely come off . When peeling it off the keys , it feels like the keys will rip off their fragile posts.Also , as is common with Bluetooth , getting the two devices to communicate with one another can be tricky . I have n't used it a lot yet , so maybe I have n't figured out the right combination of button presses . But I hate when things do n't simply `` work . `` The keyboard is fairly solid and certainly easy to type on , especially if you 're accustomed to typing on a laptop . The keys are marked with several shortcut functions to launch tasks or apps.This is a great item for anyone who wants a lightweight substitute for traveling with a laptop . While sitting in a hotel room checking e-mail , this is all you need .	1
I purchased this keyboard so that I could start doing some serious word processing on my Treo 650 , and I 've been absolutely pleased ! First off , the keyboard does not come with the Treo 650 driver -- - you must DOWNLOAD THIS DRIVER OFF OF THINK OUTSIDE 'S websiteHowever , downloading the driver is easy , and from there , you can sync it to your Treo , or email it , in an attachment , to itOnce the drive is installed , the keyboard is flawless ! My biggest complaint about BlueTooth keyboards is that they lag , as you type -- -- but this is not the case with the Stowaway -- - every key I pressed showed up INSTANTLY upon my Treo 650So far , it has worked terrificly with my address book , calendar , and email ( VersaMail ) In addition , the keyboard folds together well and is EXTREMELY thin and portable -- -- I do n't know if you could carry it in a pocket - but a backpack , briefcase , etc will not feel any extra weight with this productlastly - these keyboards are small -- - I wish the delete key was bigger ( as I often make typos ) but nonetheless , I 'm very happy , and certainly , typing on this quicker than the phone 's keyboardhighly recommended ! HAPPY TYPING ! HAPPY BUYING !	1
Originally created for use with Palm devices , the iGo Stowaway Ultra-Slim Bluetooth Keyboard for PDAs and Handhelds is still among the best folding , nearly full-sized Bluetooth keyboards available . Its metal case and relatively simple folding mechanism result in a durable product that has given me years of reliable service . The keyboard feels great ; the throw of the keys is nice and tactile feedback is on a par with many laptop keyboards . My fingers are none too slim and they easily fit on to this keyboard . Like many of us , these days , I 'm a touch typist and I find using this keyboard as comfortable as any I might find , particularly on most laptop computers . I 've owned a couple of these - not because they wear out ( I still own and use the first one I purchased , nearly a decade ago ) - but because I find it 's useful to have one at my bedside and another in my gear bag.Powered by AAA batteries makes it easy to operate . There 's no proprietary power source or charging system required . It sips power , too ; I find it lasts and lasts on a pair of NiMH rechargeable batteries.Pairing with a phone or other device is very simple . However , my Symbian phones do not handle this as they should any authorized peripheral . I have to manually connect ; I can not just turn the keyboard on and start to type , in order to get the keyboard and phone to connect . I suspect this a deficiency with the Symbian OS and not with the keyboard.The folding stand is very useful and fits a variety of devices of roughly phone-size , in either a portrait or landscape configuration.Even without its zippered case , this keyboard travels very nicely and has a durable aluminum shell.Why did n't I give this a perfect 5-star rating ? The keypad is available , I think , only with the functions of the old Palm OS mapped on to the keys . It does n't undermine the use of the keyboard with other operating systems , but can sometimes be distracting that the keys are printed with functions either not available on your phone 's operating system or the keys can not actually perform that function.I find it very unfortunate that most so-called `` smart phones '' do not support mapping special functions on to Bluetooth keyboards . Admittedly , this is not a shortcoming of the keyboard itself . Phone manufacturers are simply more interested in equipping their systems with eye-candy and games , rather than the kinds of productivity enhancements which might make their devices more useful to those of us who try to rely upon them to aid is in our work and home lives.It is astonishing to me that this keyboard is n't more popular and being emulated by other manufacturers . It would be terrific if it were to ship with software that could enable iOS , Android , and Symbian devices to map functions to its keys.I highly recommend this keyboard , if you are looking for a durable , reliable , and comfortable folding Bluetooth keyboard for your handheld device .	1
It is so funny watching text fly into my T-Mobile SDA smartphone ( aka iMate SP5m or HTC Tornado ) using the Stowaway keyboard . This keyboard is all class : just like a laptop keyboard , with the same spring to the keys , quality , durability and lovely looks to boot.Entering numbers is get-used-to'able , however symbols such as ( ) and & or % can be a major pain , due to the fact that a ) you have to use `` custom '' key commands using ctrl , fn1 and fn2 buttons and b ) if you are an experienced typer , you `` already know '' the `` motion '' for & or * or ( ) , and you 'll find yourself doing them ! ( meaning you are incorrect , on this keyboard ) That said , entry is obviously very fast and natural as this is a proper keyboard , just with some multi-purposed keys requiring key combos.The only solution is to FORCE yourself through it and just do it . You will get used to it , just like you got used to fast touch-typing.Anyhow , this thing is a gem for hammering out quick SMS text messages , etc . I mean no more `` click-click-click , clack-clack , click-click-click-click , clack-clack '' to type out a single four-letter word . Nothing feels quite like that lol ! This thing will fit EASILY in a purse and will fit in a men 's pant pocket . I wear shorts , pants , etc . and it fits fine.The keyboard clicks are quite silent . I use this in class to quicly type out extensive class notes , as I can type far faster ( and more legibly ) than I can hand-write.The case is durable sandblasted aluminum ( like my old minidisc player ) and the detachable device stand is sweet ! I use it all the time to put my phone on one of those little chair-mounted desks in class , and type in my lap . Sweet ! Anyhow , is this thing essential ? I mean , I kinda hate not having a notebook around when in , say , a statistics class with graphs and stuff ... you ca n't draw graphs with this thing very well . However , for text-based notes in a college setting , this thing is well worth it . A smartphone as above and a keyboard , and you have one of THE major functions of a laptop , but without having to carry a laptop . Just the phone you 'd have anyways , and this flat little thing.NOTE : if you have troubles reconnecting this thing , use the bluetooth connect on your phone first , then use the special driver provided by Think Outside to finish the connection . Two part process.In all , I am a college student and I wish I did not have to pay over $ 80 for this unit ( why ca n't they make it for $ 30 ? ) , but in the end this thing is slightly sweeter than it 's price , so it 's worth it .	1
I bought this to work with a Palm T3 , years ago . They never produced good Palm drivers so it was pretty much worthless . It 's been sitting in a drawer for five years and some of the keys stick , but they can be prised up with the corner of a credit card . The keyboard syncs cleanly with an iPad 2 and , if you can tolerate the way it rocks back and forth as you type , it works fine .	1
It always worries me when devices like this are still being sold at retail , while third party sellers are able to sell them for under what wholesale would seem to be for the stated retail price . Usually this reflects a liquidation by the manufacturer . But sometimes that allows you to try a gadget that you otherwise might not be able to afford . And if you need the gadget for its originally designed purpose , it may well be just what you want , despite being obsolescent . It is pure speculation on my part , but I believe that the market need now requires F1-F12 keys and this device does not have them.I 've considered PDA keyboards before but they always impressed me as flimsy junk , not possibly able to stand up to the rigors of travel or even more than occasional use . This one is different - I believe that if I put it in its little paddded bag it could go into my black bag and come out after 6 trips , two weeka later , in the same shape , ready to go when I needed it . The aluminum construction seems as solid as it poaaibly can for a folding device.When I look at the support forums for the device on the manufacturer 's web site , I see that people are asking about support for portable windows devices . This keyboard has no traditional windows function keys ( originally F1-F10 , now ( and for many years ) F1-F12 ) [ Sidebar : Why 12 ? Because that is how many the IBM 3270 , a special purpose mainframe terminal used by the designers had ] and without those you probably ca n't use it effectively with windows . I paired it with my laptop , and I was able to use it as a keyboard , without special drivers . Probably , with a great free program called anyhotkey I could get it to simulate the sending of pfks using extra non-momentary shifts , but why ? A wireless or wired full sized keyboard is what you need on a system like this.I had no trouble getting used to left ( blue ) function shifting for numbers and right ( green ) function shifting for top line punctuation , although I wish the silk screening had been against an ivory background and not the gunmetal grey one . While it might be possible for a driver to use multiple shifts to simulate F1-F12 , what then about shifted keys ? If the shift to get F4 includes a chord with the alt key , how would you then type alt-F4 ? The only possible way I could see was if this was something that you got by pushing both blue and green shifts and the top line , but if you then accidentally hit cntl , you 'd put the keyboard into pairing mode.So I believe that they are , as I write this , available at a great price for their intended market - Palm PDAs , Some Smartphones , and such . But not having function keys limits this keyboard 's future , specifically Windows Mobile devices that can be used with a full Bluetooth keyboard wo n't be fully functional when you use this device as a keyboard.One other thing that I did was to try it with my PS3 . Works great , and the PS3 does not use F1-F12 , so this is probably the perfect occasional use keyboard for the PS3 - you can text with it , or type addresses if you are surfing , or use it for naming things without having to have a full sized keyboard wired to the PS3 ( or a full sized bluetooth keyboard taking up space ) . Nothing special , I just paired it and then typed the number the PS3 gave me on its screen.My main use for this is as a keyboard formy Palm T|X . I downloaded the drivers and synced the T|X . I then went through setting up a secure connection . The only thing that I do not like ( and I am not sure what to do about it ) is that whenever I want to use the keyboard , I ca n't just open it up and start using it . I have to open it , go to applications , start the keyboard application , go into bluetooth configuration , tell it to connect , dismiss the warning that the keyboard has to be paired in the device list , and then do the cntl-greenFN-blueFN chord to make the keyboard discoverable . Then it connects and the keyboard works , and I can change to another application and the keyboard still works.This needs to be done often enough that I made an input area icon ( the touchscreen areas that allow you to immediately bring up an application ) start the keyboard app.I believe that this is an issue with the way the Palm OS works . Other systems do n't seem to need this manual restart of the drivers.Once that is done , so long as the palm does not need to be reset , the keyboard will work as soon as it comes on - so long as you do not use another bluetooth device . According to the release notes , the Palm Bluetooth support can only talk to one device at a time . If the keyboard is unused , it will power down after a couple minutes . But when you touch a key , it will resume communications immediately , without going through the menu . No , it is not a full sized keyboard , and there are some compromises , but it has a really good feel , even compared to many full sized keyboards I own.When one opens the keyboard , the first thing to do is to extend the palmtop support . The little arm that the palmtop rests on is spring loaded , and pops past a stop - if you like it at that first stop , be careful to block the rest with your thumb . There is a release on one side to open the keyboard , a release on the top that holds the keyboard open and which needs to be released when you want to close it . Just go slow.There is a single feedback light . Off ? Keyboard is not connected . Fast blink ? Keyboard is ready to connect . Slow blink ? Keyboard is connected . Red ? Low battery.Simple , easy to use , and works well . This is not a PC keyboard , and it is not a heavy stationary keyboard . For what it is sold for , it is best of breed .	1
I received the item in a timely manor , but the best thing about this product , was the outstanding response I received by the seller . It was an excellent purchase experience and excellent customer service . I would buy from this seller again . I was unable to make the item work with my blackberry 8310 , and the seller provided me the opportunity to return it for a full refund , however , my life got busy and the time alloted to return it expired , but that 's my fault and not the seller .	1
Use it for my Nokia N95-3 and it works very well.A bit bulky since its not really pocketable but fits in any bags for easy transport.Great for using it on airplanes since it is small and will not take up the entire table.Some keys are very touchy since I noticed that the `` E '' button will press twice.All in all a very nice product !	1
Great ideal for a product , works perfectly and as advertised . I just think its another item for the bag with the laptop when you are traveling .	1
Works great with my Moto Q. Typing sound is annoying but easily turned off.I also caution that you should probably store the batteries uninstalled . I put a brand new set of Duracells in it and they were dead a month later with almost no use ( Just sitting in my briefcase ) I discovered this at the start of a 5 hour flight and fortunately was able to cannibalize a set from my MP3 player . This only happened once so I ca n't say for sure that the keyboard sucked them dry.What really annoyed me was the `` Fold and unfold '' sticker which had some sort of industrial adhesive . What a stupid thing to use . It took me 25 minutes with cleaning solvent to get that darn thing off . Also the black vinyl zippered pouch stinks like some toxic chemical . If not for those two things I 'd rate it 5 stars	1
Long battery life , connects quickly to phone . Phone callers ca n't even tell I am on a BT headset , no complaints of inablility to hear my voice will on a call . It is not for people with wide necks , does not stretch much . Can slide back when active and the earphones are not in your ears . Otherwise light , controls are easy to reach and distiguish . I have the similar LG HBS730 but prefer these due to the ease of finding the buttons you want but prefer the flexible neck of the LGs .	1
Pros:1 ) Excellent call clarity and loudness both ways2 ) Excellent for listening to music3 ) Fits snugly and stays put around your neck while exercising ( unlike the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 ) 4 ) Feels much better than theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 when in contact with your skinCons:1 ) Connectivity is not as good as with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 , e.g. , it does not connect to 2 devices as once and you have to first disconnect it from the device it 's currently connected to before it connects to a new device . The LG does not have this annoying problem.2 ) The power button is located all the way in the back and it 's awkward and difficult to power on or off , unlike theLG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7303 ) Does not vibrate when you receive a call4 ) Does not have easily accessible buttons like the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7305 ) Does not look as good as the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-7306 ) Does not announce the battery level like the LG7 ) The battery life is good but subpar to the LGOverall this Bluetooth Headset offers excellent sound quality ( as good as you get with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 ) but overall it 's very poorly and unintuitively designed compared with the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 and does not have as good , seamless and versatile connectivityI 've had both for about a month and the LG Electronics Tone+ HBS-730 is clearly the better headset overall.I will be returning this one mainly because I 'm tired of the problematic connectivity and the very unintuitive design .	1
I bought these to replace my LG headset which kept dropping audio during phone calls . The sound quality is very good . It has a longer range than the LG . Overall very pleased . The software that runs the headset is not as advanced as the LG , it does n't announce the battery level and it can only be connected to one device at a time . When it announces it is connected , if two of your devices have bluetooth on at the same time , you do n't know which one it is connected to because it does not identify the unit it is connected to.Overall , though , I like them a lot . The sound quality is very important to me and I wear them a lot when I am listening to programs on netflix and for my day-to-day phone use .	1
I have been a fan of the LG HBS series since the amazingHBS-700and also own theHBS-730and the newHBS-800.With the SF500 , Motorola has clearly taken a more than close look at the HBS series and attempted to improve on it . Here 's how I find these two compare : - Battery life : Moto wins . This thing keeps on going , and lasts even longer than the already amazing HBS-730 . Too bad the remaining battery life estimator is so inaccurate ( it reports 4 hours remaining on a full charge , when it 's much closer to 10 ) - Convenience and durability : Moto wins again . The Buds sit tight around your neck and do n't bounce . The cords are not as fragile on the LGs , and the magnets holding the earbuds are much stronger on the Moto Buds . Unlike the HBS-730 and 800 , the Buds do not report their power level to the Bluetooth host ( the iPhone shows a little bar next to the bluetooth icon indicating the battery status when you use the LG headphones ) . That 's funny since the older SF600 have the feature.- Ergonomy : LG wins big time . The button layout and functionality are intuitive and logical on the LG , and completely convoluted and inconvenient on the Buds ; on the Buds , the same button is used for FF ( one press ) or REW ( two presses ) ; also , the power button on the LG is a sliding switch , whereas the Buds use an electronic switch which makes it much more difficult to find out if your headset is on or off.- Sound quality : I would rate the Buds somewhere between the 700 and the 730 ; mostly , they lack bass and presence.- Range : excellent , but the outlandish 150ft range advertised is only available when connected to a Bluetooth Class 1 device , and these are rare -- only featured on a few Motorola phones as far as I could tell . When connected to a Class 2 device ( which most devices are ) the range is 33ft like all other devices ; I think Motorola is a little disingenuous when advertising this extended range.In conclusion ... They 're not bad , and if the LG series did n't exist they would deserve 5 stars . However , considering they 're a blatant rip-off of a successful concept , it 's disappointing that Motorola improved on some of the flaws of the HBS series ( mostly the cord durability and the magnet strength ) but failed to pick up on the ergonomy ( button layout , power switch ) .Which one should you pick ? in my opinion , the cheapest one you can find , unless you need to connect to two devices , in which case the Moto Buds or the HBS-800 are a must ; and if you easily get irritated and confused by complicated controls , stay away from the Buds.Recommended , but they 're not the LG HBS-series killer that Motorola probably designed them to be .	1
The headset sounds excellent . The earbuds will not aggravate your ears when they are in ... even for long lengths of time . I would definitely recommend these .	1
Update : I 've been asked how they hold up with sweat ( see below ) . No problem working up a sweat on the treadmill , but I must stress that I 've not put in a summer run . I also must say that I do not expect longevity from a non-sweatoroof product , and that the s11 headphones are designed with a sweatproof nano coating . HOWEVER , since you asked , they still sound and work excellent . They bounce around running , but it 's not intolerable ... Just not ideal . BATTERY : I 've used them every day since I got them , and often times days at the house studying all day and going to the gym . They last from morning to night constantly connected . I often forget I 'm wearing them when I turn on my music and do n't hear any sound from my phone/tablet.Edit : just for the record , the Motorola site says these are NOT for working out ( under questions about product , it says not sweatproof and should be kept away from moisture ) . I 'm going to work out in them anyway and I 'll report back when they fail.=============================================================I bought the jaybird bluebuds x for my girlfriend , and I 've used them several times , so that is my comparison point.These headphones have a very utilitarian , price conscious design . They do n't sound as awesome as the $ 180 bluebuds , and they are n't as sleek as them ( bluebuds are just a cord with tiny ear pieces ) . BUT , they are very easy to control , very light , and sound very good . I 'm not taking away anything by saying they do n't sound as good as the bluebuds ... The bluebuds sound as good as Bose or klipsch wired models of similar cost ( even MKBHD says they are amazing ) . The Motorola buds really sound great . I 'd choose them based on sound over any of the cheaper wired sets I have ( skull candy , JVC , etc . ) The ear pieces , at first , I was worried about them . They did n't look like they would be very secure , but I was wrong . You can easily work out with them and they will stay in . And they swivel a bit at the ear pieces , so every time you move , you do n't hear a bunch of thumping like many in-ear wired sets.And taking them out to hear the world around you is nice , because of the magnets . No flopping around.The built-in equalizer settings are nice , the controls are easy , and they stay around your neck when laying on your back.So you sacrifice some portability over the bluebuds , but you get a great ease of use , very good sound , and less than half the price.And truthfully , while they are n't super stylish ... People are walking around with those giant beats studio headphones on . These look way less ridiculous than that , and really are n't that bad . Do n't wear them to a job interview .	1
I can walk away father than the next leading one and it does n't fade out even thru some of my thickest walls	1
These ear buds are just wonderful . Let 's you listen privately to anything you need to and still participate in daily activities . I would highly recommend .	1
I bought these after TWO sets of LG Tones broke on me . I like these a lot . Very comparable to the Tones . What was most important to me was battery life . I used these for listening to sports and talk radio . I have wired buds for listening to music . The only two complaints I have with this item is : the neck band is kinda tight in comparison to the Tone . Not as easy to get on and off . However , they do n't move around as much as the Tone 's . My second complaint : the on/off . I have to take the headset off to access the switch . The Tone 's switch is a much better setup and easily accessible . All in all , I would recommend these . I am hoping the quality is better than that of the LG Tone .	1
VERY COMFORTABLE , CLEAR VOLUME AND GREAT FITTTING AROUND YOUR NECK . DO N'T TURN AROUNDYOUR NECK AS MUCH AS THE LG . GREAT	1
My LG HBS-730 that I use for bike rides with no problem . Recently , the route I took has a lot of interference from the near by power lines and tower . Music from LG glitches so much that I ca n't enjoy my music anymore . I also have a Plantronics BackBeat Go 2 . This one is a little bit better , but my music still glitches and break up at the area with the most interference . My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S4 Active and it 's stored in my bike jersey back pocket , which is less than two feet from the headset.Before I try this unit , I went and try a LG HBS-750 ( one user review said it has less interference ) . HBS-750 was worst . It started to break up even before I enter the interference area.I finally give this one a try . Wow , I do n't know what kind of power they use , I had three rides so far and I have n't experience one single glitch yet . No music break up , no phone call conversation break up . It 's so nice to finally have some uninterrupted music.I problem I had was that once time , I receive a phone call and the party on the other side could n't hear me . I do n't know if it 's the other party or the headset . The party calls me back and this time , when I press the pickup button , the headset does n't respond with button push.The sound is very awesome as well . I say the bass is better that the HBS-730 . The magnet is stronger as well . I like it when I tuck the unit behind my shirt and when I am not using the ear plug and let it dangles , it naturally falls down and attached itself back to the magnet of the unit ... through my shirt . This keep the earplug from swinging back and forth when I am not using it . I do n't know if this is by design or just accident . Either way , it 's cool .	1
SPOILER ALERT : this is a stupidly long review . I like to provide as much detail as possible when I write a review , because that & # 8217 ; s the sort of thing I look for in other reviews . Buying things from online retailers is great and all , but it prevents us from getting any hands-on information until we & # 8217 ; ve already shelled out our money . Detailed reviews are the best way to combat disappointment and buyers & # 8217 ; remorse . So either get some popcorn and/or a coffee , or skip to the end , or skip this review entirely & # 61514 ; Seriously though , it & # 8217 ; s a long review . Prepare yourself.This headset is about as close to ideal as I 'm probably ever going to get , at least until headsets are implanted subdermally behind the ear , or when music and communications are beamed directly into the brain or something . It has great sound , features , fit , and looks . There are a few downsides which I 'll get out of the way first , and then I can get back to gushing about this thing . First , I feel that the earbud cords are maybe .5 to .75 inches too short . I wear this mainly when I & # 8217 ; m at work , underneath the collar of my polo shirt . The cords therefor have to dip down under the edge of the collar , and then make the trip back up to my ears . It 's fine if I 'm looking straight ahead , but if I turn my head too much it will tug on the 'outside ' ear ( if I look left , it tugs on my right ear and vice versa ) . I 've gotten around this somewhat by removing the little silicone o-rings that are intended to manage the earbud cords . It releases a little more cord length so the tugging is less noticeable , but it is still there . The cords are a bit short for my taste even when wearing a t-shirt , but aren & # 8217 ; t too bad . The next downside is that the headset does not support connection to two devices at once . I get that this & # 8220 ; one device at a time & # 8221 ; thing improves the handoff between music and calls , since this is easier when both services are provided by one phone/device , but I still wish I could listen to my personal phone 's music collection while being able to take calls from my work phone . Other headsets like the Sony MW600 handle this with ease . I should clarify that the Buds can be PAIRED with multiple devices , but can only be connected to one device at a time . Currently , I & # 8217 ; ve got them paired with my Android tablet and phone , my iPod , and my work iPhone . I can switch from one to another by manually disconnecting from one and connecting to another ( via each device & # 8217 ; s settings ) , so I don & # 8217 ; t have to go through the pairing process every time I want to switch & # 8211 ; pairing the Buds is not difficult at all , but that would get annoying real quick.Now that I 've got that out of the way , I can talk about the stuff I like about the Buds , which is pretty much everything . First off , let me assure you that this headset DOES support Apt-X Bluetooth connections where available . Apt-X is a Bluetooth audio codec that is designed to provide sound quality equal to a wired headset . Other Bluetooth audio connections have to compress the audio , making it sound somewhat muddled and , well , bad . This happens regardless of the quality of your source audio file . Apt-X support is most commonly available in recent Samsung ( including the Galaxy S3 , S4 , and S5 ) and HTC phones ( including the One and M8 ) , but there are others out there as well . If you & # 8217 ; re interested , there is a ridiculously complete .xlsx spreadsheet available from jessebandersen dot com , but a simple Google search will also yield results . I found Jesse & # 8217 ; s page by searching for & # 8220 ; aptx enabled devices & # 8221 ; & # 8211 ; it was the first result in the list . Sadly Apt-X is not supported by Apple yet , and knowing them they 'll come out with some proprietary alternative to it that only works with their own headsets ( they bought Beats by Dre in the last week or so , so get ready ) . I almost passed on the Buds because Apt-X is n't listed anywhere in the specs or reviews that I saw here on Amazon . I had to go to Motorola 's site and look up the user manual to find it . I was originally going to go with the LG Tone headset line ( which also supports Apt-X ) , but did n't like the & # 34 ; flat loop & # 34 ; design that most of them have & # 8211 ; it looks like a great fit & # 8230 ; for a robot . In my opinion the Buds are designed for a better fit on an actual human : the front of the control stalks bend gently down , following the curve of the neck/shoulders/collarbones . The majority of the headset ( including the very small weight of the battery pack ) rests on the base of your neck , and the control stalks rest comfortably near the collarbones . The LG Tone ca n't do both at the same time since it is formed in a flat circle : the stalks aren & # 8217 ; t angled relative to the neck band , and they carry all the weight of the battery so they & # 8217 ; ll fall to your collarbones while the center section will be halfway up the back of your neck ( the newer ones are curved like the Buds , but are $ 70 more expensive ) . I & # 8217 ; m wearing the Buds headset right now , and can hardly feel it & # 8211 ; a great improvement over traditional & # 8220 ; earhugger & # 8221 ; Bluetooth headsets . While I & # 8217 ; m talking about fit , I should probably mention that I wear a 17.5 & # 8221 ; collar , and can & # 8217 ; t stand having things touching my neck or throat . The Buds fit quite comfortably , and provide just the slightest reassuring touch on the front sides of my neck . They widest gap between the left and right control stalks measures just a hair under 5 inches.The Buds have a tidy control arrangement and are easy to navigate . Play/pause/answer/end/track-skip commands ( as well as EQ settings and voice dial activation ) are handled by a rocker switch on the left , and volume adjustments are handled by a rocker switch on the right . The microphone is underneath the rocker switch on the left , and the power switch is underneath the body ( center section ) of the headset , next to the charging port . Play/pause/answer/end is done by a single press of the forward half of the left rocker switch , which has a little bit of texture to it for identification/grip purposes . You can activate voice dialing ( like Siri or Samsung & # 8217 ; s S-Voice or Google voice search ) by long-pressing this same button while no music is playing . Track-skip forward is done by a single press of the back half of the same switch , and track-skip back is done by a double press . I kind of wish skip forward/back were handled by separate buttons , but it & # 8217 ; s easy enough to get used to . One thing to note about the mic being on the same stalk as the answer/end button : if you have to feel around for the end call button , the person on the other end is going to hear ALL OF IT since the microphone is right beneath it . Lots of loud rustling noises . Oops . Not enough for me to list as a full-on downside , but still ... kind of annoying . They could have placed the mic on the right , which come to think of it is a whole lot less & # 8220 ; busy & # 8221 ; since it mostly only has volume control functions . Volume down is achieved by pressing the forward half of the right rocker switch , and volume up by pressing the back half . You can mute an active phonecall by pressing both portions of the volume rocker , and reject an incoming call by long-pressing either one of the volume buttons . EQ modes can be changed by a long-press of the & # 8220 ; Play/Pause & # 8221 ; switch on the left . There are 3 EQ modes , but there is no indication of which one you are in , or documentation of what the effects are supposed to be . There is a voice notification of & # 8220 ; EQ mode changed ! & # 8221 ; but that & # 8217 ; s it . You & # 8217 ; re on your own to figure out exactly what that means . My best guess is that the modes are flat , treble boost , and bass boost . As a general & # 8220 ; audiophile & # 8221 ; rule , flat EQ response is best since it doesn & # 8217 ; t meddle with the sound balance and you hear it as the artist intended . I can barely tell which EQ mode is bass boost , but can & # 8217 ; t tell the difference between the other two . And if I can & # 8217 ; t tell the difference , then I guess it doesn & # 8217 ; t really matter . I & # 8217 ; d recommend switching modes while listening to your general type of music , getting to an EQ setting you like , and then never changing it again . As is obvious from the pictures and literature , the earbuds are held magnetically to the ends of the control stalks when not in use . The magnets are pretty strong , and the earbuds have yet to bounce themselves loose . In fact , they are so strong that if I remove an earbud from my ear but don & # 8217 ; t attach it to the end of the stalk , I & # 8217 ; ll eventually find that it has connected itself at some point as I & # 8217 ; ve been moving around . Needless to say , don & # 8217 ; t get any of these parts too close to any of your credit cards.As far as sound quality goes , I & # 8217 ; m really impressed . The earbuds are said to have & # 8220 ; Premium HD speakers & # 8221 ; , and whatever that truly means , they sound great and the Apt-X support really helps them shine . I should point out that the Buds will still sound great with non-Apt-X devices like Apple gadgets , and will certainly sound as good as all other Bluetooth headsets that don & # 8217 ; t support it . As long as the earbuds are seated properly ( which is critical with any in-ear earbuds ) bass response is nice and solid , and everything just sort of sparkles . Not saying that & # 8220 ; sparkle & # 8221 ; is added in any way , but if the music has fine detail in it then you & # 8217 ; ll hear a lot more of it . Speaking of having the earbuds seated properly , the documentation talks a bit about about & # 8220 ; micro-adjustability & # 8221 ; , and what this translates into is that the stem of each earbud can pivot a certain amount around a central axis in a sort of narrow cone shape , so the angle of the stem relative to the earbud & # 8217 ; s body can change a bit to fit different peoples & # 8217 ; ear structures . The earbuds seem to stay fairly well seated unless I get really sweaty . Speaking of sweat , I will also note that the Buds are not labelled as & # 8220 ; sweat proof & # 8221 ; , which does make me worry a little bit . I sweat easily , and do a lot of biking and walking , and my work is somewhat physical too . Hopefully this does not become an issue . There is a little rubber plug you have to partially remove to access the charging port , so make sure you place it back securely before getting sweaty . Anyways , back to audio quality : One important thing to note , which is true of all high quality sound delivery devices , is that the final output depends highly on good source material . You should know by now that low quality sources like 128Kbps .mp3 files or even some tracks on Pandora and other streaming services aren & # 8217 ; t the best , and with these you will hear every little bit of their badness . Other headsets may mask this but they & # 8217 ; re also masking the fine detail of better quality files , so in a way it & # 8217 ; s actually a good thing . Call quality on both ends of the line is really good as well , and I & # 8217 ; ve never had anyone ask & # 8220 ; Are you using Bluetooth ? & # 8221 ; which I usually get when I use other headsets . In fact , I had one person stop me in mid-conversation and ask & # 8220 ; Didn & # 8217 ; t you say you were going to put on your bluetooth headset ? & # 8221 ; , and almost didn & # 8217 ; t believe me when I said I already had . One last thing about audio quality & # 8211 ; if you listen to music via any app with preamp gain , you may want to be reduce that gain level to zero . I use PowerAmp on my Galaxy S4 and was dismayed at first to hear a ton of distortion , especially in the low end . I almost returned the headset because I could not get rid of it . I eventually found that the preamp gain ( on PowerAmp & # 8217 ; s EQ settings page ) was set to about 75 % of its capacity , and turning it down eliminated the distortion completely . You can get rid of the distortion at 25 % , but why risk it ? I keep it at zero now just to be sure . Doing so also reduced the overall volume , but since these things get plenty loud on their own , I don & # 8217 ; t mind at all.Usually I hate the looks of most Bluetooth headsets : the obnoxious blinking blue lights and the giant blobs of techno-crud clamped to peoples & # 8217 ; ears make them look like extras from bad 80 & # 8217 ; s sci-fi movies . I have to say that the Motorola Buds practically disappear , especially while wearing them under the collar of a polo shirt . They do have an indicator light , but it is nestled in between the power switch and charging port , so it & # 8217 ; s not visible at all while they & # 8217 ; re being worn . I have to say , at first I wasn & # 8217 ; t too pleased with the fact that even the black headset has white bits on it ( the undersides of the flat cords , the silicone ear pieces , and the forward/inside halves of the earbud shells ) . I have changed my mind and have very much come to enjoy the subtle high-contrast design . It looks nice and modern without looking like it & # 8217 ; s trying too hard . As I said , it practically disappears under a polo collar & # 8211 ; all you can see is the white silicone ear pieces and a touch of the white from the cord . When you & # 8217 ; ve got an earbud inserted , the white flash from the undersides of the cords help make it a little more obvious to others that you & # 8217 ; re either listening to music or talking on the phone . I say & # 8220 ; a little & # 8221 ; because people still give me weird looks when they walk into a room while I & # 8217 ; m in mid conversation . I have to make the universal & # 8220 ; I & # 8217 ; m not a lunatic , I & # 8217 ; m just on the phone & # 8221 ; gesture to most folks , but the observant ones can figure it out for themselves more easily . I see these now come in blue , which makes me even more sad that they don & # 8217 ; t come in red . You see , I have a sickness . A sickness which has yet to be defined ( or even acknowledged ) by Science , in which I have an overwhelming love ( some , like my wife , would say & # 8220 ; unhealthy obsession & # 8221 ; ) for black things with red trim , or red things with black trim , or & # 8230 ; well , you get the idea . If these came in red , I & # 8217 ; d sell 4 of my 5 pints of blood ( or at least my black/white Buds ) to get a set . Maybe one day.Those are the main points I wanted to talk about . There are a few more things that don & # 8217 ; t really fit in the review elsewhere , so I & # 8217 ; ll stick them here . The specs say that the wireless range is up to 150 feet , but that is with a & # 8220 ; Class 1 Bluetooth device & # 8221 ; , which your phone probably isn & # 8217 ; t. Realistic use is still around 30 to 40 feet , with minor barriers like walls and doors . I don & # 8217 ; t even know where to find a true Class 1 Bluetooth device , so get that 150ft range spec out of your head . Battery life seems to be pretty good , and although I try to charge the headset every night , I & # 8217 ; ve gone as far as 2 full workdays of mixed usage without running out of battery . They & # 8217 ; re rated at & # 8220 ; up to 12 hours & # 8221 ; of playback , but it & # 8217 ; s anyone & # 8217 ; s guess as to what that actually means . I talked about the silicone earpieces earlier , but forgot to mention that they come in 3 sizes & # 8211 ; small , medium , and large . The Buds come with the small ones installed already , but I found that the mediums were best for me . The earpieces on most of my other earbuds ( both wired and wireless ) are 99 % interchangeable , but these are slightly different . The posts on the ear stems are a slightly smaller diameter than standard , so earpieces from other sets are a bit loose . Swapping other earpieces to the Buds would result in more sound leakage and result in poorer sound quality and bass response , and also put you at a much higher risk of having one of the earpieces coming off the stem and sticking in your ear . Trust me , you don & # 8217 ; t want that . Stick to the 3 sizes provided and find the one that best suits you . Use the biggest size you can stand , because a good seal is critical for good sound quality . Another thing I mentioned briefly was the Buds & # 8217 ; voice notifications . The Buds have a set of pre-programmed voice notifications built in that you & # 8217 ; ll hear as you turn the headset on and off , or change EQ settings , and maybe a few other commands . When you power it up , the headset plays a short musical tune and then a chipper female voice says & # 8220 ; Welcome to the Motorola Buds ! & # 8221 ; When you connect to a phone or mp3 player , the same voice says & # 8220 ; Device 1 connected ! & # 8221 ; The voice isn & # 8217 ; t too bad , but it took me a while to get used to . When you receive a phone call , it will play another tune at you instead of mirroring your phone & # 8217 ; s ringtone . I think it & # 8217 ; s a riff on the first few notes of & # 8220 ; Ride of the Valkyries & # 8221 ; but I could be wrong . The Buds also play a soft & # 8220 ; bloop & # 8221 ; noise every time you play or pause or adjust the volume . Other than these & # 8220 ; bloop & # 8221 ; noises , there is really no indication of whether or not the unit is even powered up . I mention this because if the headset loses connection it will automatically power down after 5 minutes to save battery . If you pick the headset up after a while and don & # 8217 ; t know what power state it & # 8217 ; s in , hit a volume button and listen for the bloop . The headset has yet to drop Bluetooth connection on its own , which is a first for all the headsets I & # 8217 ; ve owned and is kind of impressive . The very last thing I wanted to talk about ( yeah , I made a list ) is that there are very thin rubber strips that run up the undersides of each control stalk , which I think serve the purpose of covering the track the wires run through . A small section of one of these strips popped up after about a week and would not seat itself back down . I eventually decided that they are probably held in place by some sort of adhesive , since I could not get it to & # 8220 ; pop back in & # 8221 ; , so I placed the tiniest dab of Krazy Glue in there , wiped off the excess , and held it in place until it dried . This was about a month ago , and it has not popped back up yet.So that & # 8217 ; s absolutely every observation about the Motorola Buds that I & # 8217 ; ve made since I got them . If you & # 8217 ; ve read through all that , I salute you . I probably owe you 20 minutes of your life back . Sorry about that . Now on to the summary , which I promised at the start : For the tl ; dr crowd , I wholly approve of this headset . It & # 8217 ; s the headset I & # 8217 ; ve been waiting quite some time for , and it & # 8217 ; s finally here . Features , fit , sound , and looks are all pretty much perfect , and it & # 8217 ; s hard to come up with a list of serious disadvantages . As I write this , it & # 8217 ; s available here for $ 58 , which is quite a steal . The nearest competitor is the LG HBS-800 , which normally goes for $ 130 . Check these out & # 8211 ; I don & # 8217 ; t think you & # 8217 ; ll be disappointed .	1
An excellent device works great and fits well in your ear ... . truly useful while driving and when you have your phone in your pocket . Was shipped well and in time by amazon	1
I was very happy with my HS820 for the first 3 weeks . It was comfortable and transmission was good . UNfortunately , it was defective and stopped transmitting . I am giving it a good rating based on the performance up until it stopped working .	1
I just love this bluetooth headset . It was so easy to pair up with my new Sidekick 3 . I did not have to do anything except charge the headset and then turn it on . Thanks again Amazon.com for providing me another great product at such a great price . The sound quality is outstanding . People on the other end just know that I am talking on a landline phone until I tell them that I am on a Bluetooth wireless headset and they are astounded . I highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for a brilliant headset at an excellent price . The Motorola HS 820 is the bomb ! ! !	1
This was my first foray into the BT department . I first had this paired to a Moto v551 then later to a RAZR v3 Silver and Black . The only shortcoming I can find is the method used to turn the unit on and off . There are times you think you have the headset turned off , but in reality you just redialed the last person called . The HS850 is a better designe here , but thats the only `` one up '' the 850 has on this headset . The volume and fitment of this 820 are much better than on the 850 . I have only had 1 signal related issue and that was due to me being too far away from the phone . Overall a great buy !	1
I have to think that some of the other reviewers have older phones , and therefore problems with the unit . It 's my first bluetooth headset , but I could n't be happier.P.S . People dissin ' it because it does n't work 25 feet from the phone or because it does n't stay on your head when jogging ? I guess I 'm not as adventurous with my cell phone as some others ...	1
Bought one then a second one , I 'm impressed , my phone is by the same vendor and I think it is ... the worst phone I 've ever had , but this headset is comfortable and works with my phone and my wife 's LG faultlessly.Be aware that there is no mute button , you 'll have to use the phone for that.Lasted 1/2 of a year now junk , will no longer hold a charge	1
It is not the `` greatest '' The sounds works fine on most calls . it is not very good on call overseas . people do n't hear very well . However , I am mostly satisfied with it .	1
Excellent sound quality and easy to pair . Looked just as the ad said and the shipping was right on the money .	1
I 'm using mine with the Jabra A210 non-bluetooth phone adapter and it works fine . I 've used it in the office on my cellphone ( handsfree allows me to type and talk with no wires ) I use it in the car and it gives me great movement without wires . Very small clips around the ear and you do n't even realize its there . Very pleased with this unit . I charge it overnight and it works all day from 530am till 11pm constantly receiving calls . I 've had this for a about a week and I 'll leave it on this weekend to see just how long it will last before running out of gas . I 'm pleased with the quality of the Microphone and Earpiece . Ca n't believe just how well the mic works . I can shout and whisper and the volume is constant . This is my first bluetooth earpiece and I 'm happy with it ! Some calls have slight distortion , but since other calls are crystal clear , I have to believe its the cellphone connection and not the earpiece .	1
This headset works fine . It fits perfectly over the ear . Volume isgreat ! connects quickly . No echooo . Maybe all the nay sayers need abetter cell phone . I 've tried three bluetooth devices and the HS820 isfar superior to the rest .	1
I bought this headset for probably the same reason most people did , the price . For 30 bucks and from a reliable company you ca n't go wrong . I got what I paid for . The sound quality and the mic quality are both decent , enough at least for someone who is n't obsessive about how crystal clear the reception is . It has a tendency to drop the connection sometimes for no apparent reason , annoying at times , but not very common.About a month after use , it stopped working for no explicit reason . I sent it back and got a replacement from Motorola . However only a month or so after that , I seemed to have misplaced it , and had pretty much thought it was lost.Today , about a month and a half later , I found it , in my dryer . Apparently it had been in the pocket of one of my jeans that I had n't washed for a while and it went through a whole wash and dry cycle . Happy that I found it , but I all but gave up on it to work again . I gave it a shot anyway , and lo and behold , it did start charging . So after an hour I tried pairing it with my phone , and voila , IT STILL WORKS ! I was stunned . Not only that a bluetooth headset could go through that abuse and still function like new , but a headset that seems relatively cheap and outdated ! So based on my first experience it was a 2 , but any piece of electronic equipment that can survive a wash and dry HAS to get two more stars in my book . Reliable , and saved me from shelling out more money for a more expensive replacement . It gets the job done .	1
I always thought it was obnoxious to leave your headset on all the time , but now i know why people do it . One you forget you have it on and two it 's kind of a pain in the neck to setup . This particular product is pretty good , it pairs up well with my RAZR after saying yes to no less than three questions and works very well . The only complaint I have is it could be louder , but it serves my purpose .	1
I love this headset . It 's light , has good voice quality , louder earpiece volume than the phone itself ( Mot V710 ) and the battery outlasts the phone . A previous reviewer mentioned having to carry 2 chargers . Motorola makes a Y adapter so you can charge both your phone and headset from 1 charger . I think I paid under $ 10 for it but do n't quote me . I love the headset but when I 'm in an airport , it picks up the background noise as loudly as my voice . If it was noise canceling it would have gotten 5 stars . One last note : My phone does n't ring when connected to the headset so you must have the headset on to know you have an incoming call . This is a complaint about the phone though not the headset.Update 03-05-2005I just bought an HS-810 because I keep getting complaints of background noise being louder than my voice . I like it better but the 820 does have better incoming sound quality . But all in all , I like the 810 much better . The flip open design is especially nice . Search for the HS810 to see my complete review.Update 07-21-2005My Motorola V710 went in the dunk a few months ago so I had to buy a new one . The new software allows the phone to ring even when the headset is connected . Much better .	1
I got this as a Christmas present for my brother and he absoultely loves it . When talking to him it sounds very clear and there is no static . It is a much better than my Jabra headset which cost nearly twice the price .	1
At first , I was a bit leary about buying one of these , because I had heard that they were never loud enough unless you were in a very quiet place . NOT TRUE ! I have to say I 've had to turn down the volume on this before ! Now , do n't take that out of context , but this is a great product . I live in Texas and drive a loud truck , and I 've been able to use this product driving down the road ! I would definitely recommend this product . A great purchase for the money .	1
This is a great cable for me ! ! I love using it in my car.I connect it to my smartphone to listen to my radio app while I am traveling out of town.Once I lose range of my favorite radio station I plug it in and continue listening to my favorite radio station thru the app . .Great deal !	1
It does what it 's supposed to . Hook up my cell phone to my car so I can listen to my mp3 . I 'm not a audio geek/master so I do n't know if it 's a good decibel or crisp bass or tremble , but songs seems to play well .	1
I bought one for my dad to use occasionally and tested it for a couple songs and had no issues like others have had , maybe I 'm not using it as long . It is cheaper feeling than my more expensive ones . I will update this if things change .	1
We bought this item to replace a broken 3.5 mm cable we use to connect our FM modulator to our iPhone 4s . We needed something with a thin piece of rubber over the plug so that it did n't catch on the after-market case on our iPhones . this product worked great , and the price was excellent .	1
The price was good and the cable works great . It seems to be well made . There is n't much else to say about this product .	1
This is a basic cable . It works and it is cheap . There is not much else you can say about it .	1
The concept of the phone is terrific . I have to use a 2-way pager for work , and instead of carting around a cell phone and bulky pager , I now just have this one small item . And while I did n't think I 'd really use it , the Bluetooth functionality has definitely sold me . I can use it not only for a wireless headset , but to connect to the internet and to transfer sound files back and forth as well.The software of the phone seems to be a bit buggy still , unfortunately . When I lock the keypad , I still sometimes hear tones when the keypad is pressed and the display lights up . The menus are sometimes slow to respond , delaying as much as 2 full seconds ( does n't sound like much , but it can be irritating ) .Overall , I 'd buy the phone again without hesitation , but I 'm an early adopter . If you 're willing to put up with the occassional buggy behavior , I 'd definitely recommend this phone .	1
The A630 is another ground-breaking handset design from Motorola . It showcases the ingenuity of American engineering when you see the QWERTY keyboard hidden underneath on this lightweight ( 4 oz . ) cell phone . It 's stylish , too , and has great reception -- that is , where T-Mobile has coverage at all . Compared to the Sidekick II and many other T-Mobile phones , the A630 has the best signal-keeping capability , but T-Mobile just sucks big time , unless you live right next to one of their sporadic cell towers . Worse , their GPRS ( data ) network is slow and congested . While surfing the web on the A630 is really cool when the network is accessible , for most part of the day the network is slow and often inaccessible . We really need the govt to step in and mandate that these cell companies upgrade their networks first before charging consumers an arm and a leg for data services .	1
Wife loved it as the `` Razr '' thin phone craze took over . Flip phone with keypad was nice . Used it 2 years with 0 problems .	1
This phone is good for the price , but if you really want a good mobile email solution , get a Sidekick II.Positive : The A630 has good sound quality , and absolutely fantastic sound quality if you use a bluetooth headset . T-Zones service is an inexpensive way to gain access to your POP3 email accounts . It has a keyboard . You can download pictures to and from your computer using a bluetooth connection ( I did this using my Mac ) .Negative : The built-in email software is very poorly designed . It is sloooo [ ... ] It requires way too many key clicks to accomplish common tasks . The most common email commands are buried in the menus , the least common commands occupy the prime spots . Someone did n't think about this enough . It takes me 7 clicks to delete a message -- that 's too much . They do n't take advantage of the keyboard enough : The keyboard has a Delete key , but you ca n't use it to delete a message . That 's a waste . Likewise , you have to scroll through your emails one ... line ... at ... a ... time . Why not use the space bar as a quick scroller , like in Outlook ? To issue a command , you have to use the menu and arrow keys . They should have assigned letter or number keys to each menu command so you can navigate more quickly with single keypresses . ( My old Sony-Ericsson phone had this feature ) The case is pretty , but because it 's perfectly symmetrical , you ca n't tell which end is up by feel alone . The keyboard is so slick that you ca n't dial by feel either -- you need to look . These are safety issues . ( but if you have a headset , you can dial by voice ) So far , the battery does n't last more than a day with below-average use.The A630 is best for people who want bluetooth , and who primarily talk or text , and who use POP3 occasionally , or not at all .	1
Pros:1 . Compact in Size ; 2. eye-ball-absorber design ; 3 . Good bluetooth connection ( w/ HS820 headset ) ; 4 . Convinient input keyboard ; 5 . The screen is clear enough to show a vivid picture ; Cons:1. battery is toooooo weak . A full charged battery can only last for one day ( with normal amount of incoming and outgoing calls and without any other devices connected ) . A lot shorter than they claimed in the description ( 6 days in waiting mode ) ! 2 . A little bulky compared tp other camera phones ( like samsung ) ; 3 . The phonebook is a little different from all the other brands ; 4 . System freezed up once when I input phone numbers with bluetooth device connected . I have to reset it by taking the battery out ; 5 . No zoom function with the build-in camera ; Ca n't observe the picture from front small screen when taking photos with the phone closed ; 6 . No software ; Just one Java game come with the unit . No choiceother than purchasing more on line .	1
great product at a great price	1
Forgot I had this on my phone until I got the request to review it . But , my phone has been working exceptionally well lately ... because of these boosters ! ! I have a Blackberry Torch . You just put this sticky little piece of film by your battery and *viola* you have way better reception ! ! Seems to do the trick . Recommend ! ! And it 's a great price to boost your phone 's antenna .	1
So far it 's working as intended . I 'm satisfied and the price is right . Easy instruction of how to install the booster inside your cell phone .	1
I do get reception , but it added a bar for me . These are no 'Magic Bullet ' for bad reception , but they can take it 'just over the edge'.I have used these before in old phones , but they get 'lost ' easily if I forget to remove them when changing batteries . So this is good enough to 're-purchase ' , at least for me .	1
It gives more bars then had before . Such a perfect item . Made my bf very happy as well . So perfect of an item .	1
First , let me just say to those who bash this phove because of T-Mobile , STOP ! You are here to review the phone , not the service . How is it phone 's fault ? It 's your service and should n't be phone 's fault.Pros/Features : Qwerty Keyboard makes it easy to send text messagesWeb BrowserAOL Instant MessangerYahoo MessengerEmail at your fingertipsCamera Phone with Room for up to 36 photosOrganizer/Calender/CalculatorNifty Design reminds you of a mini-laptopCons : Bulky : Looks like a mini-laptop but wo n't fir easily in your pocket ... Case/Belt Clip is a MUSTButton Size : Could be small for those with big fingersWeb Browser : Slow , but beacause the sites could be cached , it gets a tad faster . Do n't expect cable speed ! This is more of 28.8 speed.No background wallpaper : Because of the deaktop icons , background image is n't availableOverall ... Positive Outweigh the tiny Negatives by a ton . If you are an internet.IM junkie , you will fall in love with this phone . The reception in my area is fine . However , the reception varies from area to area .	1
I really enjoy this device -- being able to check email and blogs and send IMs while out and about is really nice . However , it 's kinda huge compared to a regular cellphone , and I found that to be a bit of a drag . My service agreement seemed kind of pricey , and the coverage was poor ( I could n't get a signal in my own kitchen , and I live in the middle of a big city , not out in the country ) and in the end , I 've shelved this phone for a smaller one with a cheaper monthly fee .	1
I started out with the sidekick color switched for a short time to the Blackberry 7100t and then came back to the sidekick II . I So love this phone . There is no other phone on the market that compares in many areas.Pro 's -Super easy to use.Best messaging out therebest screen out therecrazy good data servicegood downloads for ringtones , games and appsGreat signal ( I was in rural Kentucky and still got a signal ) Very reliableBest Data/Voice plan with T-mobile -- I have been with T-mobile for 5 years or so and have tried other services during that time . No other service has provided any better phone , signal , or features for a lower or even a competitive price.Con'sIn order for service to remain good you have to periodically reset the phone . Dont know why , but when I do that it fixes any reception problems . T-Mobile techs said this was a good idea.That 's it everything else is normal and great about this phone.Unless you need corporate email dont bother with the blackberry . It was the worst phone I have ever used .	1
I 've had my SKII fo a little over a month now and find it a good fit for my needs . I am a business user , not a Snoop Dog groupie , and this is a VERY cool device.Coverage in my area ( Austin , TX is good ) and while I have not yet traveled away from the IH-35 corridor , I had good voice and data coverage all the way to the TX/OK stateline ( as far north as I went ) . For $ 20/month all you can eat data , this is a screaming deal . I do n't find the web surfing that useful ( speed is about like a 28kbps dial-up connection ) but for email it is superior to the Blackberry 957 I used a number of years ago . The interface for the phone and for email and the address book is great . Far better than any Nokia phone I have ever used . The intellisync software allows me to create use a separate address book in Outlook that I can then sync with the SKII with a one button push . Very simple and means you can have an abreviated address book if you are concerned about having this infor resident on TMO/Danger 's servers . I agree with another reviewier that it would be better that this info is NOT resident , but if that 's a concern , limit what you leave on the server.Drawbacks are no bluetooth , no resident memory for email , pictures etc , no removable memory stick and no easy way to create and use your own ringtones.Great things , great keyboard ( nicer/bigger than Crackberry ) , intuitive interface/software screen size/clarity . Camera a nice feature , easy to email pics anywhere . A very cool and functional device if you need phone and and email . The web and other stuff are `` OK '' but TMO data network will have to get faster and more WAP coded websites for content that is relevent for that to be a big reason to buy/use this device.I purchased through Danger 's website total cost $ 0 after $ 200 instant discount and $ 100 in rebates . Worth a year 's contract with TMO in my book . Paying $ 49/mo for 3000 regional anytime minuets and $ 20/mo for all you can eat data ( email , text messaging , etc , etc EVERYTHING DATA included ) .I would recommend this to anyone that really needs email and occaisional web service in addition to phone service . Not the smallest/best coolest phone , but the best convergent communication device on the market right now IMHO .	1
Pro 's : Very easy to use.Qwerty keyboardOTA ( Over The Air ) software upgrades that add usability to it once or twice a year.Full buddy list loading for AIM and YIM.Synchs to both Windows and Mac computers.Large clear screen.Allow for export of web bookmarks.Use up to three Pop3 or Imap4 email addresses with it.Con'sNo external memory.limited camera memory.no Bluetooth.no spell checker for the emailNo Microsoft Exchange email support so no corporate email unless it is a Pop3 or allows you to login from the web.Overall an excellent device .	1
I give it five stars - despite some technical problems : You can send and receive vcfs in e-mail attachments - but you ca n't always file them when you receive them . They are rendered well enough such that you can move the material manually . This varies - as long as they have a filename that ends in .vcf and a mime type of text/x-vcard or text/directory , and otherwise are formatted correctly , they will get taken . But , some applications , for example , evolution , that great Linux e-mail application , does not give something that was never a file a meaningless filename , so the sidekick will not file evolution 's vcards ( unless you export them to a file and resend them with the right mime type ) .Rather than picking the name of the vcard for import out of the vcard 's formatting , the sidekick uses the filename . This might mean that it would be simply to pass garbage through the vcf interface , so be careful.You can get URLs in SMS messages and they show up as URLs , but you ca n't click on them . You ca n't click on URLs out of the AIM browser - you can copy the text and mail it to yourself , then click on the URLs out of the mail , where it pulls them out and makes them clickable at the end.The documentation says that the phone has a WAP browser . You might say , `` With a regular browser , why would I care about a WAP browser ? '' - The answer is bandwidth - you want to look up a phone number , WAP will be faster . And there are some cool wap games . But the real answer , according to the T-Mobile Tech supervisor is that the WAP browser is vaporware - it does not work . Maybe someday . There are sites you ca n't browse without javascript that have working wap analogues ( like microsoft 's sms generation site ) . So you ca n't browse them at all from the phone.That is about it . Most of the rest is great . I moved my Nextel data over by exporting the data from the Nextel site , and , in openoffice , I rearranged the column names to match what would have been exported from Outlook Express , and then imported . Oh , yes , I also built names with a formula . Saved it as a comma file , just like Outlook had , and , poof , in about a minute , a couple hundred phone numbers , addresses , and names migrated and merged and appeared on my phone . I could have mailed vcfs for the 70-80 contacts that I was using , but that did n't work.I 've resisted all the games ( I want MINESWEEPER - yes , I know it is lame ) . I might have to drop $ 4 for solitare.I did drop $ 10 for the terminal program , and it has already become helpful - the terminal program is wonderful for something on such a tiny device . I can check out servers by connecting to them in raw mode , by port . I can ssh , securely , to my server . There are lots of disconnects , mostly related to when you stop typing to think for a couple of minutes , but a program available in Linux called `` screen '' allows you to save programs running in the background and reconnect to them , see their output , get status , and all that stuff . I can even get on IRC using a character mode IRC client.Someone called me to fix something on a weekend - it was something I could have fixed in 5 minutes on a real terminal , it took eight on the tiny terminal . In many ways , emacs seems to work better than vi does in character mode , but they both work.One secret is that you can log in to your windows box using ssh in character mode using free products from cygwin or SFU ( from Microsoft if you have pro ) . Command line only , sorry.To echo the comments about the AIM client , which is utterly reliable vs. the yahoo client , which drops and reconnects all the time , is probably worthwhile.The documentation suggests that you surf with graphics off for speed . But many buttons are graphical and , unlike every other character or graphics off browser that simply displays the alt text , or , if there is none , `` [ IMAGE ] '' , the button completely goes away , which means that you ca n't access what the button points to . This essentially means that you have to leave graphics on to surf.Occasionally , web sites are mis-represented - on eBay , for example , there is an extra entry bubble generated between the search text bubble and the putton you push - if you enter text there ( which seems the right place ) searches do n't work.Despite all these niggling problems , and t-mobile 's hapless tech support , I am still giving this device five stars . The astounding thing about a poker playing dog is not that it wags its tail when it has a good hand , but that it can tell that it has a good hand at all.The difference between getting text directions and being able to pull up a map of the area you are in as you drive down the road is wonderful - and then javascript stops you from being able to pull up a turn by turn map as you need it.I did not expect to have something in my hand that would allow me to log in to my system using ssh , browse at all , much less pull up mapquest maps .	1
The Sidekick 2 has a better form factor than the competitors such as Treo 600/610 and Blackberry offerings . It has a better more comfortable keyboard . It 's more like a mini computer than a phone , which I like . It can fully multitask , unlike Palm . You can download a webpage , check email and chat on AIM all at the same time , unlike on the Palm , which will interrupt the process if you leave the application . Further , the Sidekick II has both AIM and Yahoo ! Messenger.I like the built in camera and I find I do n't miss having a Palm at all especially now that you can use Intellisync with the Sidekick 2 to sync all your contact/calendar information with your desktop computer . I never really liked stylus input on the Palm anyway and again the keyboard on the Sidekick is a lot better . The Blackberry units are nice however I still find the Sidekick more cool , easier to use and it has better instant messaging capabilities.My only slight complaint is that the Sidekick 2 does not have a replaceble battery . I would much prefer to be able to swap out the battery .	1
I have used a lot of screen protectors for my iphone , and this one is the best . I 'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works . For the past two years I would n't even try them , using only the anti-glare covers . Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great ; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there ( was n't the case with previous clear covers I had used ) . Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between . And finally , finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover . Highly recommended .	1
The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4 . I ordered the anti glare version and it is easy to apply w/o any air bubbles . The protector works nice on the sun light . Also no finger prints or marks visible . Would definitely recommencement .	1
Absolutely love this screen protector . It came on time and the product was just as expected . I love how it comes equipped with everything you need to install it . A wetnap , dry nap , cleaning cloth , and the flattening clip you use to even out the protector once its on . It looked very professional and my Galaxy S4 Screen looks SUPER vibrant and clean . You can not even tell that theres a screen protector . I would recommend this screen protector to anyone because the value surpasses the price . Afforable and efficient .	1
I 've been a loyal BoxWave customer for years . The quality , price , value , and dust free installation are unbeatable . These shields do a great job at protecting ALL of my electronics and also hold up well to scratches so that I do n't need to even replace them . Could not be happier .	1
Just recived my screen protectors and there amazing . They came packaged very well . They come with a very thivk cleaning cloth and some wet and dry cleaning wipes . Once I put on protector on it was really clear no problems at all great feeling to the protector it was cut really well . Will defenetly buy more when I need them wont be using another protector but boxwave.. very satisfied ( :	1
Oh my , crystal clear ... stands up to its name . ..absolutely easy directions to follow ... No lint . . my screen looks like it has no protector on it . I am very careful with my device , so I do not know how it will handle items scratching the screen or fingerprints..I received it quickly , and I did n't have to pay for shipping , plus because I bought one item , received this packet for free . It comes with two screen protectors . If you follow the directions , you should not need the other . I have purchased others , and followed the directions and still end up with lint underneath ... YES , I would recommend this item . ..It is a must have for your phone . ..	1
I 'm a lover of all gadgets and always have to get the `` coolest '' cell phone out there at the time . This phone has been really great over the past 14+ months that I 've owned it ( I have the blue version ) . I 've not had ONE problem with it doing anything it should n't do ( i.e . randomly powering off , antenna problems , etc ) . I can not say that for every cell phone I 've ever owned . LG makes a great cell phone and within their different models , I think this one is the best I 've seen so far . My brother has this exact model and loves it , too.The phone has a beautiful color screen , easy to navigate menus , a nice camera and video function , and OUTSTANDING battery life . The only complaint I will echo is that it would be nice at times to have a speakerphone . Other than that , this cell phone is the best I 've found - including several other LG models that friends and family own .	1
I had it over 3 years and it was working great . Battery lasts very long . Phone is very durable and solid .	1
Ok , so I used to have a Motorola T720 ( one of the worst phones made ) , and a Motorola Timeport 8767 ( One of the best phones ever made ) . I needed a new phone and ventured into the local Verizon Wireless store . I happen upon the LG VX7000 and think ... this thing is huge ! I do n't need a camera in my phone ... but then I pick it up and play around with it . It 's pretty comfortable to hold . The screen is nice , bright and clear . I wind up purchasing one from VZW online and when the phone arrives , I put it to the test.This phone so far for me has been terrific ! The phone itself is a tad larger than my last T720 but not by much ... the main LCD is a nice bright TFT screen . Included are some wallpapers , 3 `` real '' pics ( A Sunset scene , an island scene , and a group of people scene ) , a Verizon Logo wallpaper and a few `` doodle type '' cartoony pics . You can change the settings for the display easily , as the UI for this LG is much better than my old Moto . The front LCD is nice enough ... you can also set a wallpaper here or use a pic taken from the camera to use as a picture ID when that person calls.Ringtones ... kinda forgettable ( I am beginning to think cell phone providers tell phone makers to make some pretty useless ringers so you download decent ones ) . You can however , record your own which sound surprisingly good with the internal mic , as well as download them from Verizon 's Get It Now Brew service . You can also , use MP3 's as ringtones through a little trick . One think I like ... this phone is loud ! ! I can hear it ringing in a crowded shopping mall even . The vibrate feature works well enough and can be activated quickly ( though this requires you to flip open the phone ) .The camera is located where the `` hinge '' of the flip would be and rotates so you can snap a pic of yourself without contorting your face and arms to face the lens . You can also change some pic settings like black and white and sepia tones , etc . The camera is quite decent for a VGA cell phone camera . There is a flash though this is rather useless except for close up pics . The camera also lets you take 15 sec video clips which you can save and email to your friends . While I figured I 'd never use this feature , I have twice already . The advantages of having the camera/video in something you always carry is quite nice ... it 's fine for candid moments and though your friends might know you have a camera phone , they wo n't probably guess you 're video recording them . : DThe call quality is nice , loud , and clear ... much better than my old cell phone . Battery life for me has been approx . 5 days with light usage and charges in a little over 2 hrs . Mind you , the old `` blue versions '' of this phone had a charging plug near the data port ... the new `` black face '' ones charge straight through the data port.The holster that came with mine ( the black vx7000 ) was great ... solid and not cheapy like some phones are . Notice that the face of the phone flashes colored led 's near the `` flash '' when you receieve a call or are making one ... some like it some don't.I like the phone and it 's size is deceptive . Tonight I showed it to a friend and she said , `` that thing is huge ! `` ..then we compared it to her Panasonic camera phone and she noticed ... hers was bigger lol . This is one of Verizon 's best cell phones right now ... highly recommended .	1
Guys , I have used several of my friends bluetooth headsets ( motorolas and jabras ) and had decided I did n't want one . Then I found the Mobile Freedom and read the reviews . I know Logitech and have used a lot of their stuff with good results so I tried it . IT DOES EVERYTHING YOU HAVE READ ! ! It 's quiet in the wind , it 's battery lasts for days for me , it 's easy to use , easy to pair and the sound quality is awesome ! ! Nobody could ever tell I was using a headset . It takes a bit to get used to the ear clip , but once you do there are no problems . It may be a bit heavier and larger than some , but then those little tiny ones that look so chic also have TERRIBLE reviews and TERRIBLE performance ! ! Try it out , you wo n't regret it .	1
I bought the Logitech after reading numerous reviews on various brands . I use the device with a Motorola V551 phone ( Cingular ) . It works geat ! It charges very quickly and the charger folds up in a compact fashion when not in use ( the electrical prongs fold up into a recess in the charger ) . The unit holds a charge for a long time . I left it in a drawer for a month , pulled it out and it was still ready to go ! I use the device a couple of times a month on business , when driving , etc . The windscreen is outstanding and cuts out noise even when driving with the window open . some people complain about the ear piece . It seems fine to me and you can adjust it easily , but keep in mind any headset is an annoyance when you first wear one . Then it becomes second nature.the sound is great , the phone detects the device quickly , its fairly comfortable . All it all it performs just like a device twice its price ,	1
I have a Motorola Razr phone and I absolutely hate it because it has low hearing volume and bad reception resulting in missed calls . I was seriously planning on returning/selling it until I got this Freedom headset ! It makes a huge difference ! Very lightweight and comfortable ! No problems with range or battery life . A little bulky though . Just got it the other day and a must buy , especially at $ 40 with $ 10 rebate = $ 30 ! !	1
Its the only bluetooth headset I 've used , so I do n't have anything to compare it with . Has made my ipaq 6315 much more usable as a phone . Sound quality is good , some people say I sound far away , I 'm experimenting with the gain on the ipaq , we 'll see if that helps . It was a little tight for me at first ( big ears ) , I was able to bend the part that goes around the ear a little and its much better now . Great battery life.Would be nice to have an external ringer on it , so I could hear it ringing or vibrate if I were away from the phone . Good range 15-30 ' .	1
i had bought the motorola HS820 before this one for $ 80 . i have a motorola V505 from at & t . ; the motorola worked pretty well , but i thought $ 80 for a bluetooth headset was way too much . i returned the motorola and picked up the logitech instead and for 1/2 the cost , i was just as happy.it fits a little awkwardly on my ear , but so did the motorola , so i am thinking my ears are the problem . call clarity and voice recognition is good . battery life is good . weight on ear is good . overall , i am pretty impressed ! i wish there was some way to adjust the tightness of the earpiece as it feels kind of loose on my ear . would also be nice if the `` on '' button was n't so small that you covered it up with your finger when you turned it on , making it hard to see the flashing blue light.whenever i use my microwave , it makes the bluetooth connection drop . just warning ya ' . ; )	1
I 've been using this headset for a few months and could n't be more pleased with the battery life . It recently had no problems keeping up with a four hour Skype session ! It is also capable of pairing with multiple devices , so you can for instance use it with your computer at home and your cell phone on the road without having to redo the pairing every time , something cheap brand-X headsets do n't do.Logitech was kind enough to supply a very tiny charger , perfect if you take your headset on the road . For those international trips , no problem : it can handle 100 to 240 volts and 50 to 60 Hz ( translation for the technologically challenged : you can use it anywhere in the world , just get a cheap prong adapter ) On the negative side , it 's possible to jam the connector into the headset the wrong way if you 're not careful . Of course the battery wo n't charge up and the light wo n't go on , a dead giveaway . It caused no damage to my headset , but the connector design could be better.I found this headset very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time . The volume is loud and the sound quality is very clear . People on the other side liked the sound quality as well.There are a few negative points that cost this otherwise excellent headset a star : * after 10 minutes of inactivity , it goes to low-power mode `` sleep '' . When the phone it is paired with rings , it may take up to 5 rings for it to wake up and start ringing . If you press the answer button before the headset starts ringing , you will lose the call . If you want to answer right away , you can always answer on the phone but if you do so pressing the answer button on the headset will not transfer the call to the headset like it did on my Sony Ericsson HBH headset , but hang up . To transfer the call to the headset , use the appropriate menu on the phone instead . * The ring on the headset is an irritating , non-modifiable melody . It would be nice to have a few options ! * The headset is fairly large and dorky-looking.Despite these few drawbacks , do n't forget that this is a very capable , well made and reliable headset at a bargain basement price , one of the best out there . If you can live with the looks , it 's a super deal .	1
I 've had this for about a year . It works great . Great call quality , no static . Battery life is real good . The only bad part is this looks like a part of a males anatomy and I do n't really want that on my head . Otherwise great buy .	1
Let me say a few things : Buy THIS device . Here are the reasons : - 7-8 Hours talk time- True 30 feet range- Wind filter for clear talking- Small and comfortable , does n't intrude your ear- Crazy price , huge quality- Warranty and reliability of Logitech ! I 've used a Sony Ericsson and Jabra BT200 and I would say the Jabra is much better than Sony Ericsson , but the Logitech blows them both away . It 's faster to put on the Logitech and the range is much better . The microphone is clear and crisp and the speaker volume is loud and sufficient.For me , I used a Jabra A210 bluetooth adapter for a Sprint Sanyo 8100 phone w/2.5mm headset jack . It gave me BT on my phone so I could use this headset . The auto-answer and hang up depends on your phone whether it would normally do so with a headset or not . Works great for me ! If you are considering a headset , get this one . It 's what bluetooth technology should be like . It 's so great that Amazon sold out ... nice . It was $ 39.99 ( where did they all go ? ? ? )	1
I was a bit skeptical when I saw the price and read some reviews but I thought hey its Logitech it must be good . I was right this headset is very comfortable compared to another headset I just bought . The ear speaker is loud even to the point that I do n't have to have it on the highest setting . The mic was the thing I was worried about though , so I called my friend 's cell phone and talked to myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the sound volume and clarity . Also I have n't had any complaints from other friends I 've talked to with the headset . It has been my experience that Logitech makes the best wireless devices for the buck and they did n't let me down with this one ( second Logitech wireless devices in two month ; I also bought their xbox controller which is definitely also worth the buy . )	1
I have used it now for 2 weeks with a RAZR V3 and I am satisfied it works as advertised . It was very easy to pair the headset with the phone . The sound is good even in noisy environments . The headset is light , confortable and fits well.My only complaint is about the smart button used to turn on/off , answer , dial and pair . The button is also a LED indicator . The LED flashes diferently ( different colors , intervals ) for various modes but it is difficult to see the LED while pushing and holding the button . After a few days I got used to it and now I know how long to hold the button down to switch on/off , pair or use voice dial.At $ 42 it is a good deal .	1
very cheap excellent value . the problem with most is their uselessness when confronted by windy conditions- this does a much better job than most . v simple instructinos , though it lacks the ability to switch easily between headset & phone & back.nevertheless at $ 35 or under , brilliant value .	1
I bought the Logitech Mobile Freedom Headset ( 980228-0403 ) for use with VoIP on my HP zt3000 Windows XP SP2 notebook . I wanted to use a wireless headset and VoIP to make international calls , mostly from hotel rooms . This headset did not work out of the box for my situation . The Logitech support website was great . It said to upgrade the notebook 's bluetooth software . The HP site was also excellent . I downloaded bluetooth and many other newer drivers . Once installed , the headset immediately worked as docuemented . The other newer drivers solved all the weird hibernation problems I 've been experiencing too . I 'm using Skype for VoIP service . Skype setup has an option for using the bluetooth headset for Skype only , otherwise the normal audio devices are used . All in all , installation was a bit of upgrade work but competently supported . I now have a VoIP connected wireless headset that allows me mobile freedom . Due to my usage , I have no comment on the audio quality or useability with mobile phones . The device apparently will not work with the majority of PocketPCs due to a lack of bluetooth software . Thus I only gave it 4 stars . However , HP does sell stereo headphones ( no microphone ) for most IPaq models.Update : 15-March-2005 Am able to pair with Axim x50v PocketPc . Has considerable static . Skype and other apps nearly unusable . Continues to work with XP well . Suggest Plantronics MX100I Stereo Headset for using Skype on a PPC .	1
Got this headset to replace my Jabra ( which was incompatable with my Nokia 3650 ) . Fit and comfort is extremely subjective but I found the Jabra to be far more comfortable ( I would actually forget I was wearing it ) ; that said , this unit is not uncomfortable ( until after a couple hours ) just not nearly AS comfortable or securely fitting.Very few complaints as far as performance . It was easy to pair with my phone , my wife 's Motorola V3 and even my laptop . Sound quality is clear for both parties ( recipients occasionally complained of a pinging noise with the Jabra ) and the noise reduction actually works to eliminate wind noise . Battery life is excellent . The single function can be a little aggrevating ( especially when trying to turn it off as you have to hold it down for a long time ) . The only weird and very rare quirk is occassionally calls will be interrupted with a strange sound that sounds like someone dropping a manhole cover as it spins on pavement - very strange , very annoying and fortunately very rare.Overall , performance is top notch , comfort is acceptable and value is difficult to beat .	1
I have been using this for a month.PROS : It is a good value . It works really well , and it lasts a very long time on a charge . The WindStop feature works very well . People have been able to hear me very well while driving and even while playing volleyball . It stays on the ear well but is not uncomfortable.CONS : The unit looks okay but is less attractive than some of the other high-tech units on the market . 3 of my co-workers have commented that it looks like I am wearing a phallic symbol on my ear , which is really not the look I would like to achieve .	1
Because I spent a lot of time on the phone , I am very particular about BT headsets . I have tried every brand of BT headset you can imagine , I mean EVERY brand . I was so frustrated to a point I was ready to go back to wired headset until I ran into this little guy . This is by far the best one , hands down . My most miserable experence was with Jabra and Motorola . I had a lot of connection and audio quality issues with those brands.BT headset designers seem to favor visual appeal rather than performance . I do n't understand by most headsets on the market are short and stubby , in which the microphone is right next to your ear instead of your month . Having microphone that far away results in having to turn up the microphone sensitivity , which cause the headset to pick up everything including background noise . Lack of an effective noise-filtering system such as the one in this Logitech headset , you end up with wind noise , car noise , AC noise , every kind of noise but your voice . In additional , the close promixity between the speak and microphone creates a feedback loop for a nice serving of constant echoing . I lost count of the occasions when my friends and coworkers on the other end of the phone tell me to `` get off your crappy Jabra BT headset '' or `` take me off your Motorola BT headset '' . I am amazed that people on the other end can easily tell it 's a Jabra BT headset because the horrid sound quality.Onto this gem , the sound quality is amazing , by far the best of the bunch . The WindStop system really does work . Together with the farther extending microphone , this unit produce the best sound both incoming and outgoing . I know many users complaining about the fit , but it 's really a fault of the user . As one reviewer pointed out , there is a `` correct '' way to wear this , and I think it provides an excellent fit and comfort.I ca n't speak for all , but I personally do n't wear a BT headset as a fashion statement . I use it as a mean for convenience and safety , so sound quality and fit are top factors for my consideration . On that note , this is a clear winner . I wish product managers and designers at Motorola and particularly Jabra take note of that . Jabra ( 250 and 250v models ) being the worst with it 's behind the ear design and a heavy-trigger button is really a very lousy product in terms of usability and sound quality . I am sure customers that raved about Jabra would rank this unit out of this world !	1
Good reception . It fits OK on my ear but not perfectly . It seems sturdy . Price was better than most . The wind does n't bother it much either .	1
We bought the Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter to go with ourPlantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headsetand have been very pleased with both devices . Using the handset lifter give you the ability to answer calls directly from the wireless headset , which is good if you spend a lot of time away from the physical phone to which the headset unit is connected.Setup was amazingly easy , just following the directions allowed us to get this installed in just a few minutes on our very inexpensive no-name speaker phone.Like our Plantronics Headset , this has passed the test of time and I would buy a new one if it failed today.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
This device allows me to answer incoming calls on my NEC phone while I roam the office with my Plantronics wireless headset in place . This headset already has enough wireless range to cover half the floor in my building , so the ability to answer the phone at such a distance is extremely useful in a bunch of situations . A couple of key features : When a call comes in , either Intercom or from an external line , there is a chime in my ear that alerts me to the call . I can then press the single button on the headset and the receiver is lifted , allowing me to receive the call.When the call is done , I press the single button again and the receiver hangs up.It 's about as simple as conceivably possible.The install instructions were however less than perfect . To get this to work properly , I have to unplug the phone base from the handset and in to the Plantronics unit . The handset is then plugged in to the Plantronics unit . This was not explicitly stated in the install instructions . It took 10-15 minutes to figure out the trick . Once that was worked out however , everything has been perfect.The only thing that I can not easily do is pick up parked calls as there is no function to select a line . I can live with that shortcoming .	1
First of all , I must start out by saying that I am a little surprised that this little mechanical device is even necessary with all of the technological advances out there these days . The HL-10 is kind of a `` throw back to the seventies '' in terms of its jerry rigging function . Having said this ... Plantronics builds quality stuff and I am sure that there is a good reason for it . The device does exactly what it is supposed to do once you adjust it for your individual phone . I was a little concern that it would fit my phone but they include plenty of adjustment options to take care of any setup . I am using it with a Plantronics CS351N headset - which I love for it professional wireless function . I tested the HL-10 by picking up/hanging up the headset 10 times in sucession and the lifter raised and lowered the receiver successfully each time . That was good enough for me . Definitely worth the $ if you own a wireless headset and you roam around the house/office while talking on the phone .	1
I used this phone lifter in combination with the Plantronics CS50 Wireless Office Headset . It was a powerful combination that allowed me to answer my phone up to 300 feet away from my office . This lifter fits onto your phone base and lifts the receiver when you press a button on your remote headset . You can answer the phone or hang-up when the call is completed without ever touching the receiver.The lifter came with a plug in mini-microphone ring detector that attached to my base phone and it allowed the base station to notify me when the phone was ringing . The setup was quick and easy and the device took up almost no space on my desk as it attached to my phone.I spent thousands of hours a year on the phone and this device along with my remote wireless headset saved me a lot of neck stress and phone holding for hours a day . This is a useful tool in any modern office and I recommend it to you .	1
It looks strange stuck to the side of the phone , but we have an older Starpluss STS system that needs the handset lifted for a wireless headset to work properly . This item was easy to set up . It took about 10 minutes to unpack and install .	1
Our office phones lifters stopped working so I decided to take a chance on these lifters instead of having to order a whole new headset and so glad I did . They work great !	1
This handset lifter is great . It works exactly as I expected it to . It also arrived when I expected it to .	1
The vender of our phone system wanted to charge us hundreds of dollars for some other mechenism to interface with our wireless headset system . The Plantronics HL 10 was not only much less expensive , it works flawlessly and was easy to install .	1
HL10 Handset lifter works great , very fast to pick up if away from the phone base ! I would buy again .	1
Works Great , a very useful accessory for any wireless headset and the Amazon price is right compared to what Plantronics wants ! ! !	1
Plantronics HL10 Handset Lifter was what was promised and it was delivered on time . I got this for my boss and he seems to like it .	1
this is a great product , but i order the wrong size and i intend to pass it forward to anyone in need of it . the purchase price was great.make sure you know the size of that adapter , before making your selection .	1
My wife uses this at work and had been using this for a year and it still works . I normally buy every 3 months because she breaks them . This is the only one that lasted more than 3 months .	1
These were exactly what my mother needed for her old Nokia 2690 . She goes through them quickly , so I got her two .	1
They r a good price and it works a win win situation . People have no problem hearing me or I them .	1
bought this for work and it works great . the sound is clear and the microphone is located in a convenient location . the clip is also a great addition to the headset .	1
I bought this for my husband . He likes it and it works jut fine for him . He has one in each vehicle he drives	1
I had to teach an on-line WebEx class . Normally I am provided a phone bridge . However , this time , they wanted to utilize VOIP only . I did n't want to use a normal head set with a cord tie'n me to within 6 feet of the computer . I needed 8 hours of talk time , I 'm the instructor . This fit the bill . I let it charge over night and it 's ready for the next day . I do put it back in the charger during lunch break . The only reason I did n't give it a 5 star is that my ear hurt at the end of the day . The piece that goes over the head to keep the unit to my ear put to much pressure on my ear . I will have to try the other ear adapters .	1
I could not be more impressed . I was highly skeptical as I have been buying bluetooth headsets like crazy trying to find one that worked , and they 're all pretty much junk . This thing worked all the way out to the sidewalk , and likely much further , but that 's as far as I went . The quality on the other end is very clear . The manual is plain stupid , it looks like they were half way through putting it together when they released it , but on the Mac the manual was of course not needed , just plug it in and it worked without any of the driver install nonsense Windows requires . BTW , I am using it primarily with Skype.OK , I have to add something to this review . There 's a fatal flaw in this device . A flaw that makes the device near worthless to me now . If the USB cable is unplugged , but the earpiece is left clipped into the holder/charger , the battery runs down within hours . Obviously a simple diode somewhere would have prevented this , but for me the device now is close to useless.Update : May 8th 2011 . So , 5 years later , the device is seriously failing . the electronics in the device are dying . I am having to constantly remove the battery to get the headset to work , and it 's cutting me off in the middle of calls . It also refuses to charge , and discharges when not in use even when the base is connected via USB . It 's a pity its failing , and I came looking for a new version , but there is none . Should I just buy it again ?	1
This is a usb wireless headset . just plug it in to your mac or pc and it sees it as another sound device , no drivers needed ( xp or os x ) I tested it with Skype on the mac and teamspeak on my pc . It comes with a sound api for windows for skype and a few others that allow the buttons on the phone to pickup or hangup calls , I did not try it out because I just like to use apps as is without special add ons ... The range is great , so if you skype and dont want to be tied to your pc then plug this bad boy in and your free to walk all over the house , same goes for teamspeak for the gamers out there.It was so pleasing for something to just work out of the box for a change ! I tried for hours to do the same thing using bluetooth and it was a mess ... This thing just works !	1
I use this product for skype calls . I found it to be the most high quality ( but expensive ) wireless headset for VOIP uses . I use it on Windows Vista and Windows 7 . The headset lasts a long time ( all day ) without charging , and I can go from my computer outside the house and half way down the street and I still have clear calls . The ear piece is not as comfortable as I 'd like , but after you wear it a while I think your head adjusts to the shape.Software install was easy , and setup was pretty no-brainer . It has other functionality and adjustments that I do not use and have not had to learn about.I use this brand also for a regular phone headset on my work phone and absolutely love it . I 've found very high quality calls and battery life on every Plantronics device I 've ever used .	1
My previous two PalmOS phones were a Kyocera 6035 and a Samsung i500 . Had I not needed Bluetooth to work with my new Toyota Prius , I 'd have stuck with the i500 . In fact , if Samsung/Sprint had released the i550 ( SD memory slot , faster , etc . ) I would have never considered the Treo 650 . So , let 's talk about the positives of the 650 : Camera w/movies is nice . Memory card slot is nice . It 's fast . Bluetooth sync with my Mac Powerbook is awesome - no more plugging up cables to HotSync ! Handfree in the Prius works great . Having a PalmOS 5 based machine gives a more powerful web browser that can view more sites . Higher rez screen is nice.On the downside , the lack of graffiti would be okay if this keyboard was as good as the one in the old Motorola PageWriter , but instead , it 's as small as they could make it , requiring shift-keys to get to slashes , @ symbols , numbers , etc . A real hassel and even though I could blaze on the PageWriter , I 've been reduced to about half the speed on this keyboard due to all the extra work . Having software-graffiti would have been nice , and the third-party add-on `` write on screen '' apps are okay , but not as accurate as what my 6035 or i500 had.No voice recognition at all , but for $ 20 you can get a program that is awesome and does n't have to be trained . `` Call 5 5 5 1 2 1 2 '' and it does . `` Call Bob Tompson Mobile '' and it matches it to the address book -- no training , beyond numbers . VERY NICE.Battery life is so-so . You have to charge it each day if you use the 'net much . i500 was poor , too , but better than this . The 6035 I could use for almost a week without charging it ! ( 6035 and i500 had analog modes , too , while the 650 is digital only . ) So , it 's okay , I 'm okay with it , it crashes/reboots randomly all the time , but ... there 's really no other option on Sprint.I would have taken a flip phone over this huge brick phone in a heartbeat ... But there is none , so , with that said , the Treo 650 is okay . More steps back , a few steps forward , but no other choiuce .	1
I just got the Treo 650 through pre-order the other day after using the Treo 600 for over a year ( and 4 replacements ... the 600s just kept breaking ) . It is a dramatic improvement and I love it.The screen is now high res and looks incredibly clear , the Bluetooth works wonderfully with the wireless Jabra headset . When a call comes in simply hit answer on the phone and the call comes through the headset . I do n't particularly like the comfort fit of the Jabra on my ear so I will probably be looking at other alternatives as well.The camera is now actually good enough to take snapshots you would keep . Almost as good as some of the low end digital cameras . A few of the critical buttons are placed more intuitively.Initial setup went pretty smoothly , so far , it seamlessly upgraded my old Treo 600 software and imported all my contacts and calendar as well as almost all my applications . The Sprint phone rep that activated my phone actually seemed to be quite knowledgable.The only real CON is that the Treo 650 Hotsync cable connector is big and clunky compared to 600 . IMHO they made a backward step by replacing the sleek original Treo connector with the Tungsten design connector . It requires a separate power supply to charge . I have been used to charging my Treo 600 through the single USB hotsync cable to my laptop . This extra power connection is a messy annoyance . The upside is that since the battery is removable I can have a spare charging elsewhere.Overall opinion is that I would n't even consider returning to or buying a Treo 600 now that the Treo 650 is available .	1
I am not too picky when it comes to a PDA phone , if I can keep my outlook calendar , appointment , and call the contact store on it , I 'm happy ! But I do wish the Treo 600 can be better ! I had the Treo 600 for almost 1 year and upgraded to Treo 650 as soon as PalmOne asked me to that 's because Parts of my prayer has been answered : A better screen resolution ; touch screen is more sensitive than the 600 , I use my finger instead of the stylus now ; camera is a lot clearer and the zoom works great ; removable battery is really handy to use that fully charged spare one any time ; my favorite bluetooth is built-in . And that little keyboard lites up in bright blue and white is very easy to read . Thanks to the faster processor , the program loads a lot faster.However , I am still looking for the built-in WiFi , and the bluetooth does not take voice command ; reboot is not as easy as Treo 600 . I do not notice the boot up being slow because I rarely have to . However , I did notice that it takes up more internal memory and thus make the available ram less than 10MB the first time I turned it on . ( Palm is doing a flash upgrade to fix this , so I heard . ) With an SD card , I put a bunch of application on it to get around this until it get fixed . And I was able to have about 18MB available internally.I like this new Treo 650 , as to all my handheld gadgets , I bought a fitted case to protect it . If you like me want to keep everything in perfectly nice looking condition , I recommad a case and a screen protector . Remember , this is a hefty investment comparable to a PC , this Treo 650 may even be your home phone , make sure it is well-protected .	1
I purchased this phone a few months ago and can truly say it is one of the best investments I have ever made ! I had doubts on how comfortable I 'd be lugging around a big phone like this , but that was short lived once it was in my hands . I get so much use from this phone , not only for the phone itself , but for the PDA capabilites . I have never been so organized and on top of things . The only thing is that it sometimes freezes when it connects with my Bluetooth , but it 's a minor complaint and one easily overlooked when I look back and see how much this phone has helped me .	1
I 've owned a Palm of some type for about seven years , and had a cell phone for slightly less time . I 've always resisted buying a combined device , because I thought `` they are n't ready yet . '' When it came time to replace my PDA , I decided that the Treo 650 might be ready . I had concerns about the size of the screen , and about integrating PDA and cell phone functions . Overall , most of my nervousness about it was groundless . I am pleased with the phone so far.Good points : Works well as a phone -- Better signal than the Nokia phone it replacesScreen is very readable , even though it is smaller than on a traditional PDAPalm functionality is fine . The interface has been redesigned a bit , and you seldom need the stylus . Most entries are done with the rocker switch at bottom center of the screen , or with the keypad . You truly can do many functions one-handed . But they managed to do this without losing the feel of the Palm , you are n't having to re-learn from zero.The memory is non-volatile -- In English , this means that if your batteries go dead , you do n't lose all your data till you re-synch your Palm.Bad points : Those who complain about a slight delay when dialing from a number in the Palm contacts list are right . It 's not really a problem , but it is an annoying couple of second delay.If you are one of those who read books on Palms , I 'm not sure the screen will do for prolonged reading.Battery life is fair . I am able to get two days out of it with medium use , and have a bit of life left in the battery . Not like the days of the monochrome Palms when you 'd go for a week between recharges ! It 's only so-so as a web browser.The price is hideously high.Keyboard is cramped , but about as good as you can expect on such a small device . It is definitely useable . My instinct was to use my right thumb only , but I now believe the people who claim that if you use both hands ( thumbs only ) you 'll be faster.From what I 've seen of the Treo 600 , I do not believe the upgrade would be worth it for those who currently own a 600 . If you are waiting to make the jump into a combined PDA/phone , I believe thhis is a good point to do it .	1
I am in love with this phone ! First off , the Palm functionality is wonderful ! The address book and calendar all work excellently , and the cross-functions are greatImprovements include SMS messaging , which is much faster and now includes hyperlinks for phone numbers and web addresses , unlike the Treo 600The web on here is faster -- -- the screen is crisperHowever , BlueTooth is the BEST new feature -- -- - wireless data transfer is , usually , quick , and the wireless headphones are greatLastly - many have complained that the phone is too slow with its functions and unstable -- - however , ever since the system software was updated to 1.12 , it has made the phone much quicker and much more stable ! Ordering a new phone today should come with that 1.12 software built into it , alreadyI am a former Treo 300 and 600 user , and the 650 is a wonderful upgrade and worth every penny , considering the bluetooth and software improvementsso buy it ! ! ! - you wo n't be sorryPS - the Cardo Scala bluetooth earpiece is the best earpiece out there for this phone	1
Solid bluetooth headset , particularly considering the price . I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear , rather than inside . It 's extremely lightweightSolid bluetooth headset , particularly considering the price . I like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear , rather than inside . It 's extremely lightweight and can be worn for hours on end without discomfort . I 've only had this for a few days , but so far the battery life seems great as well .	1
I had this headset originally , and then lost it . After I lost my original , I figured I 'd give a motorolla one a try , and purchased the most expensive motorolla on the market ( H700 ) .Using my treo 650 , I COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING people were saying , and got constant complaints that the people I was talking to could n't hear me well . The volume was terrible , and so was the sound quality.This headset is SO LOUD that i have to keep it on the 3rd from highest setting . The clarity is great ! People think I 'm talking on a land line . For the $ 35 bucks , I bought a new one and chucked my motorolla in the garbage.IM SO HAPPY TO HAVE MY SCALA BACK !	1
Probably the biggest compliment you can give this headset is that you 'll often forget you 're using it . The Scala 500 is incredibly lightweight and ( when adjusted properly to your ear ) very comfortable.I 'm impressed by the controls . Both the main button and the volume 'wheel ' are very accessible and very responsive . With the Sony HBH35 headset I was constantly dropping calls due to the unresponsive controls . This never happens with the Scala 500 . Additionally , volume is easily regulated.Pairing with the Motorola MPX220 phone was quick and easy . Additionally , reconnect is quick and reliable following a disconnect due to powering off one of the units or going out of range . ( Range , by the way , is good ; comparable with the HBH35 headset . ) You can hear the other party clearly and crisply . Transmission of your voice , I would say , is good . Though there 's infrequent interferrence ( static ) on voice transmission , I 've never had anyone complain about difficulty in hearing/understanding me . There 's NO annoying `` bluetooth echo . `` To sum it up : Plusses : Price , size , weight , comfort , pairing , controls , sound quality , range , responsive customer service.Negatives : Requires charging cradle ( one more thing to haul around if you 're traveling ) , no 'fuel guage ' to indicate battery life ( red flash comes on , but only when it 's close to dying )	1
Works well even in the wind . Ca n't listen to music through it with my SLVR though , as expected . I find I do n't use it much though.I set up a shortcut in my SLVR for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset . If I have a bluetooth headset active , it refuses to play music at all - through the built-in speaker or a cable . But this is the fault of the SLVR.Update : I dropped it outside , where it got rained on for two days before I found it . Thoroughly dried it out and turned it on . Still works !	1
I was so lucky to find this headsetI use a Treo 650 -- -- - I have tried a variety of headsets , including all of the Moto 's -- - the Scala is clearly the BEST for the Treo 650 , and likely , many others1 . The volume was very good -- - louder than any other headset I used with the Treo 6502 . The connection times are usually very fast too -- -- - most headsets take awhile to establish a connection , but this one usually takes just a second or less , and of course , automatically picks up both outbound and inbound calls3 . 90 % of the people I talk to say that they can hear me very loudly and clearly -- - rarely do I get a 'barrel ' effect going with this headset , as many others produce4 . The wind-noise-cancelling technology is for real -- - I have talked a couple times outside , in blizzards with this thing on -- - quality was loud and clear on both ends , despite the high winds ! However , it seems that I have to re-connect the pairing for this device , every now and then ( maybe once every 3 weeks or so ) -- -- otherwise , I 'm very happyPretty good talk time and battery , and of course , the volume is great ! Check it out in new colors -- -- clear , blue , and red ! Lastly - the price can not be beat ! highly recommended ! - HAPPY TALKING ! ! ! ! !	1
I use a nextel i730 and this jabra adapter fits on the back perfectly with velcro . ( adapter is approx 1/8 thin ) The adapter has 3 tiny setting to adapt to different phones and I find setting # 2 to work fine with my motorola HS820 wireless earpiece . This adapter works on Nextels direct connect and regular phone calls , my last adapter would not do the direct connect . So far I have had the adapter and earpiece on for over 16hrs with out a charge , while receiving many phone calls and direct calls during these hours . Ca n't wait till Nextel comes out with a bluetooth phone but till then , this is the only way to go !	1
Perfect for my Contour Roam GPS camera . I got two of these to have as powered spares , along with a portable charger ( that also charges via USB ) , so I can always keep one charging , one charged , and one being used !	1
I bought this from Amazon to have an alternate batters from my GPS logger and it gets the job done . Its cheap and worth the price ...	1
I bought this battery to replace the one in my dash cam . i charged it up like the instructions said to do , and wow . i can use my dash cam a long time before plugging it in to the power point in my truck.the price of this battery is really good for the service that you will receive from it.if you need a new battery get one of these .	1
After searching and searching for a battery for our baby monitor -- the Levana BABYVIEW20 , I found out that it uses this Nokia battery . I was too nervous to buy this type of product for any seller other than Amazon . I did just that and it works and fits perfectly .	1
After 6 months of use , the battery still performance well . I ca n't tell if this battery is genuine or not .	1
No issues at all with this battery order . Its an OEM Nokia BL-5C battery as advertised . Nothing exciting and performance is as it should be for a new battery . Price was excellent as compared to retail , so I am very satisfied with purchase .	1
I purchased this for my father-in-law . His battery was about to wear out its welcome . It arrived ahead of scheduled date , and has not had a problem with it .	1
I recently purchased two of these batteries for my four-year-old Nokia cell phones . Based on about a month 's trial , both batteries seem to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time ... much better than the old batteries . Seem to be a good choice , especially for the money .	1
The nice thing about this battery in my case , is that it came fully charged and ready to use . It fit perfectly in the phone as I would have expected . It 's an excellent buy compared to other sources .	1
Works . Good quality battery . What more can I say about a battery ? It fits . It charges . It powers . It 's a battery at a very reasonable price .	1
I bought this is a gift for my brother . He loves it ! It works perfectly with his iPhone 5 and even works with Siri .	1
Loving it . Clearly sound on calls , long live battery and comfort ear hock . I trust all of Motorola Bluetooth Headset .	1
I have paired this with an unlocked RAZR , and so far they both have worked great ( 2 months ) .It fits well on both ears , not so big , and the voice quality is very good . I also found the price from amazon , really competitive	1
I STILL USE IT TILL THIS DAY . IT HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN . I LOVE IT . HEADPHONES CA N'T EVEN TOUCH THIS !	1
While this does n't have the range of the Nokia bluetooth headset i tried , it is vastly more comfortable . I 've used it with a Samsung t809 and had no issues with it over a couple days before this review . Range was about the 30 feet they are supposed to have , beyond that signal fading was rapid . Very light , easy to use and fortunately mid range signal tones .	1
The Motorola H500 is a very good unit . It has excellent sound quality and is easy to operate . The only negative thing is it does hurt the ear after wearing it for awhile .	1
Bought two of these yesterday . Pink one for the lady and grey for me.Voice quality , both incoming and outgoing is excellent . So light , you can wear it for hours w.o . a problem - you forget it is there . Volume is definitely loud - but can be adjusted , if you want.We are using it w. SE r520m phones - first generation ( `` years '' ago ) that had BT built-in.I had bought a Cardo `` Allways '' head set in 12/03 . It was so cumbersome , neither of us really used it . It was uncomfortable.I can see I 'll be using this most of the day . I am a heavy cel phone user - 2000 min./mo . - mostly day time.I find it strange in reading reviews of these items that some find a model to be quite good in a feature ( eg . volume ) and others find the same model unacceptable . Since no two people have the same size OR shape ears , probably a headset should be tried on for fit before purchase - just like you would a pair of shoes ... .mt	1
I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out . It was plagued with low volume and poor connection . After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I have n't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet . The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car . Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and does n't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear . So if you 're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - do n't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device . Ca n't go wrong with the price !	1
I bought two of these . One fits over my ear perfectly while the second unit takes a little more time to secure because the ear hook is kind of loose . They 're both plenty loud enough , clear reception , good range ( phone can be two rooms away ) , and people on the other side of the call say they could n't tell I was on a headset.Great performance considering the price paid .	1
Very pleased with this purchase , excellent sound quality when speaking and listening . Also , the plug for the charger is sturdy and a good fit for the headset .	1
I needed a BT headset for the longest time ... ..since I never used one and was getting worried that I may get busted one day . I saw this on Gold Box and ordered it immediately for $ 15 ... .how could you go wrong ? It is intended for use primarily with a Blackberry Javelin ( 8900 ) . It paired quickly has held a charge for 2.5 days thus far ( light-moderate usage ) . My opinion is that it does what it should at its price point and I was not expecting a miracle.If you are looking for a BT set that has loads of noise canceling and voice detection..then this is not for you . Look for a Jawbone by Aliph ... The H500 is a model that has been around a long time and is perfect for my needs . I just wish it were a bit louder and thus I am giving it a 4/5.Great value , great item .	1
This is my first bluetooth headset so I do n't have anything to compare it to , but so far it seems to be pretty good . It 's small , very lightweight , and comfortable . It 's hard to judge the comfort of this device unless you try it yourself because everyone 's ear and head are different.I 'm using it with a Motorola Razr V3m from Verizon . It paired easily and quickly . The connection is a little crackly even right next to the phone , which surprised me , but it 's not so bad that it takes away from a conversation . Naturally , the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates . Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it 's a good headset and fine for my purposes . Only a few drawbacks : the volume and call buttons are a little hard to manipulate , and it would be nice if the unit could be held tighter against my head .	1
Right off I have to say that when it comes to cell service and phones and the inherent contracts : you get what you pay for , in more ways than one , and buyer beware ! I do my research , ad nauseum , before getting into a new contract or into bed with a new cell provider . I 've been a Nextel subscriber for two years with an i90 and an i730 . Both lovely phones - service very professional from Nextel - coverage and features what I expected . But like I said , I researched that to death before I bought their phones or their service . Got the phones from Amazon.I , too , was taken by the looks of the RAZR , and so was my wife once she saw one . But was it as good as it looked and was it worth and worth switching carriers for ? For one , Nextel was n't making it easy to stay with them - they got into bed with Sprint and I had Sprint for years and still have nightmares about their customer service . ( Plus , the price for an `` upgrade phone '' for Nextel was *unacceptable* from my point of view . Everyone knows you get a cheaper phone with a new contact ! ) I got two RAZR 's at a local retailer - sorry Amazon , but your rebates with Cingular are n't worth the effort - and paid $ 99 each , best price *anywhere . * I got a family plan which is on par with Verizon 's and saves me a bunch of money over Nextel . A *bunch* of money . Two words : rollover minutes.I spent just an hour charging the phone , reading the manual and configuring the phone to function as well , if not better , than my i730 , which is a *great* phone , and noticed similarities in function and detail and quality to Sony , Motorola and Nokia phones friends of mine have . I repeat : I read some of the manual , which is something many people seem to avoid.For anyone complaining about the phone/ address book , shame on you . I was worried about the address book based on reviews , but after five minutes with the manual and using the phone , I got the RAZR to do *everything* my nifty i730 could do and then some . There are so many ways to configure the address book it 's silly . You can assign and create `` categories '' for numbers and addresses and even have the phone only display certain categories so you only have to flip thru the numbers you want to flip thru.As for the complaints about battery life , the RAZR has a six-plus hour talk time on it , better than half the phones on the market today . I can say that cos I feel like I 've researched about half the phones on the market ... : ) Do this : plug your phone in when you go to sleep at night . I can *guarantee* you it will be fully charged in the morning.Fragile phone ? How clumsy are you ? I 've beaten up lots of phones over the years and you should expect just about anything this side of a brick to break when you drop it . Half of my i730 is made of the same material the RAZR is and has a lousier belt clip to boot , which has allowed my i730 to fall the the ground way too many times . I 'm happy with the material and it 's expected durability . Stop throwing your delicate , *expensive , * micro-electronic device around like it 's made of teflon . *Be careful . *I am not on the camera-phone bandwagon primarily because what is required to merge unlike technologies is by it 's nature usually expensive and difficult . ( A good example is the ROKR , the so-called iTunes phone . I have an iPod , and if that phone had come close to actually blending the best of the wireless world and the abilities of iTunes and the iPod , I would have bought it , but it came far short of doing that cos blending two ideas like that is n't the easiest thing to pull off well ... ) The RAZR is not expensive because it has a great camera or a large memory stick or can capture full-motion video and zip it over to your dorm room buddies in the blink of an eye . It 's expensive because it 's a *slick* looking phone and makes other phones on the shelf self-conscious . Most of the professional reviews of this phone gave it low marks for camera abilities , so do n't be surprised by that . Want a good camera phone for Cingular ? The Sony s710 got great reveiws ; good luck getting it for less than twice what the RAZR costs . That 's the difference.Last thing - I got the phone knowing I have 30 days to send the whole thing back if it 's not working out for me . So there 's a little consumer-friendly cushion to give me some time to fully evaulate the phone . Still , I did my research so there would n't be too many surprises when I got the phone.Hope this helps .	1
This is one great phone , sleek , light , small , thin . Motorola got the form exactly right , just slightly larger than a credit card , and only a half an inch thick . The screen is excellent.Motorola missed big time on this one , not including Motorola Phone Tools and a USB cable in the purchase - now how cheap is that . I just spent all that money on a super exclusive cool phone , and they make me buy software for $ 30 ? That 's actually kind of crazy.They also messed up on the phone book . 450 Outlook contacts , that were spawned from 200 core contacts - each cell phone , business , email , and home entry for an individual is a separate entry . Way way too unwieldy . They need to update this error big time . They 've also missed on priority numbers - you know , you identify people you call a lot , and they go to the head of the list . I 'm used to the problems now , but wow what a miss on their part.The camera , oh it takes pictures . They look decent on the cell phone , but forget much more . The shutter speed must be very slow , you have to hold the phone solid to not get blurry pictures ( when viewed on a computer screen full size ) - on the phone they look great.Overall - my nits are truely nits , this is one heck of a great phone . If you 're price sensitive , buy the V500 series . If you want cool , get this one.By the way , I 'm a long time ATT customer and had no trouble ( read it took less than 10 minutes to buy and activate this phone ) with Cingular . In fact the service seems better . I just wish they would port over your voice mail .	1
I bought this becasue I was very happy to see a phone with a metal case again . I used to just use nokia phones back in the day and they would break at least once a month on me . Bought the Moto v60 and was really blown away . The best phone I ever had . Then I upgraded to color phones and tried the other Motos . Really big disapointment . Moto phones are made so cheap and fall apart just like nokia . When this came out I jumped on it . Finally Moto was going back to the quality phones.PROS : -Some what sturdy case . The metal parts seem solid . No marks as of yet ( 1 month ) .-The battery life is a little tiny bit higher then your average phone . I have to charge it at night but it has at least half the life left on it . I talk for about 3 hours a day.-Camera is ok not the best and by far not the worst.-Slim form factor . And yes its wider then your normal flip but this is a good size . Other phones always seemed to skinny for me.CONS : -Not all of it is metal . The bottom is plastic and it seems to be cheap plastic . It creaks when you push on it . I think that is where the antenna is , and if it has a SAR rating of .80 ( I think ) at the ear then I wonder how much your jaw is getting . Rather my jaw get cancer then my brain right ? -The vol is almost a joke it is so low . At the highest its about what a normal phone is at its middle setting . I used to have to turn people down on my cell , now I am struggling to hear them sometimes.-The keypad looks nice but its a pain in the butt . The donut thing in the middle is already scracthed by my finger nail . The rest of the keypad is protected it seems and has no marks.-A pain to clean . The keypad is shiny and gets crap all over it . When you clean it the rubber lining between the keys grabs part of what ever cloth you are using and gets it looking even worse.-Phone book . Good god man . The fact that they used this phone book really shows that either they do n't put a lot of effort into the phone or was a total mess up . Either way it is a true shame.-Good luck with support and warranty from Moto . Past experiences with them was very poor . You send your phone to get fixed and a month later you get it back and they did n't even read what the problem was before they `` fix '' it and send it back still broken.The reason they make phones out of cheap plastic in my opinion is because what do you do 6 months after your phone looks like you dropped it down the stairs a few dozen times . You buy another . Strong durable plastic is used all the time . For crying out loud Glad uses it all the time . I am more then happy to pay 600 dollars on quality and if you have the money do the same . This phone is not even close to meeting my expectations of what I thought I would get for a 600 dollar `` basic '' cell phone . I have high standards and for top dollar I want the best . Moto might be seeing this and is offering good rebates now . 250 or something on Amazon as of now . Well worth it for that price.To the other reviewer about Verizon . They use CDMA and this phone is only for GSM . I doubt they will ever make a CDMA version . But of course I have no real clue . Call Motorola.Also sorry for my spelling mistakes and all . It would take to much time to go back and review what I wrote . I am not getting paid for this and wo n't waste my time . Good luck and I think you will be very happy with this phone over all .	1
I have been a Nextel user for years and their Motorola products including i90 , i95 , i730 and i830 . The v3 is the best Motorola product ever ! ! ! Blows the i830 out the water and makes it look like yesterdays news . Superior and striking good looks and is solidly built - no , it does not look cheap as some previous reviewer stated . I live in GA and Cingular reception is very good . Paired my v3 with Bluetrek G2 bluetooth headset ( received rave reviews and is cheap - pick one up on ebay ) and I wonder what took me so long to get on board . I did fear Cingular 's merger with AT & T ; since I had AT & T ; years ago and their reception was terrible.I 'll never go back to Nextel as they do not appreciate their customers and their Motorola products do not have Bluetooth except Blackberry . Plus who wants to carry around a brick in their pocket ? I 'm a woman and typically carry v3 in my purse but sometimes for convenience I just want to put it in my jean pocket . And I forget it 's there ... This v3 has superior browser technology , email and text messaging , good camera and great voice record . Yes , the address book is different but you get used to it . Anyways , I only put important people that I call frequently in address book so it 's not a problem for me . I primarily make lots of calls and like to check news and send a few text messages . A+++++++	1
Sexy form ... CHECK . Innovative construction ... CHECK . Exclusive price tag ... CHECK . In a sea of flip phones and candy bar phones that all look alike , the RAZR V3 is the Ferrari of mobile phones and stands out as such . If you 're looking for a feature rich phone , then the V3 is not for you as a V600 will provide the same features for far less . But if you want a high-quality constructed phone that screams , & # 34 ; look at me , I 'm a sexy b*tch , & # 34 ; then the V3 is up your alley.Actually , a better analogy would be : The Acura NSX of mobile phones . Like the NSX , I feel the V3 is a marketing tool for Motorola . It 's their way of saying , & # 34 ; We 're known for inexpensive phones , but , look , we can build stylish , well-crafted , high-end phones too ! & # 34 ; Unless wireless technology improves from GSM , the V3 is a phone that I can definitely keep for more than 2 years . The styling , design , and construction is just that good ( I upgraded from a trusty and reliable , yet mediocre Nokia 3360 TDMA phone ) .There 's been quite a debate about the construction of the V3 and the best explanation that I 've heard is that the bottom backside ( below the battery cover ) and the lower front is plastic for the antenna . It certainly makes perfect sense to me ( unless the metal frame IS the antenna ) as all the other areas are cold to touch ( in this weather ) while those areas are usually room temperature . Furthermore , it would be misrepresentation on Motorola 's part to advertise it as such . Regardless , this phone may seem flimsy , but it 's very solid -- there is no comparison w/ my old Nokia 3360 and my girlfriend 's V551.Mikey 's likeys:1- The mini-USB port . This is great for single-point access for data and charging -- it 's simple and should be a mobile phone standard ! 2- The Bluetooth connectivity . Coming from a wired hands-free setup , my Bluetooth headset ( a Jabra BT250 ) is a godsend . I can leave the V3 charging in my home office and still be connected in the living room . ( SIDE NOTE : stay away from from the D-Link Bluetooth USB adapter for PC connectivity and get the Belkin F8T001 adapter -- read my review on the D-Link for details ) 3- Quad band . Doubtful that I 'll ever use this feature/benefit , but those two words will certainly impress all around you.4- The speakerphone . I 've been a non-believer of mobile phone speakerphones , but I 've got to admit , the V3 's speaker phone is the bomb . It 's loud and clear ( but not loud enough for the car ) . My girlfriend tells me that I sound better w/ the V3 speakerphone than w/ my old Nokia 3360 and wired headset setup . When I do n't have my Bluetooth headset , I 'm spoiled w/ the speakerphone.5- The internal display . Going to the V3 from the Nokia 3360 is a leap of spacial proportions and after a couple of weeks , I have found myself to be spoiled w/ large internal display . And not only that , the V3 has an ATI IMAGEON graphics accelerator ! All other phones ( excluding PDA phones ) pale in comparison in this regard.Mikey 's no-likeys:1- No memory expansion . I do n't see myself using up all 5MB of internal memory , but an SD/MMC card expansion slot would be nice . Maybe Motorola ( or somebody else -- maybe myself ) will come out w/ a mini-USB adapter for this purpose.2- Poorly written owner 's manual . I have found that the owner 's manual is more like a reference manual and sometimes leaves you figuring things out on your own . It does not explain how to use many common features that owners ( especially ones new to Motorola phones ) use . Instead , it lists all the features and expects you to put 1 and 1 together . It 's like the & # 34 ; C++ Reference & # 34 ; vs & # 34 ; Learn How to Program in C++ in 21 Days. & # 34 ; Maybe Motorola 's technical writers are just to technical ? 3- Drops and dings . Like any & # 34 ; Ferrari , & # 34 ; I 'll probably go into a week-long mourning the first time I drop or ding the phone . I 'm hoping there will be [ good ] cases available to protect my V3 while it juggles around w/ keys in my pocket . ( SIDE NOTE : I have heard that Cingular / Lockline is not insuring this phone , but my Cingular sales guy was hesitant sell me the phone unless I bought the insurance ) 4- No EDGE . My girlfriend 's $ 99 Motorola v551 has EDGE . Shame , shame , shame Motorola . Bad Motorola . Bad , bad , bad . Alas , it 's akin to buying a $ 160k Ferrari 360 Modena and having a cheap $ 20 factory stereo system ( or paying $ 90k for an Acura NSX and it 's only 290hp ) .5- Internal display colors . I was all hyped up to hear about 260k colors , but Motorola 's specs after some detective footwork is 65k colors , but up to 260k colors in MPEG-4 video playback . Very , very , sneaky and mis-leading indeed.Wishlist:1- I wished there was a PocketPC smart phone version of this phone . PocketPC + V3 form factor = perfection.Regarding multiple numbers for one name in the review below -- you can set the phonebook to display only primary numbers by:1- setting the primary number for all the names that have multiple numbers ( you do n't have to do this if a name only has one number ) ; 2- set the address book view to & # 34 ; Primary Contacts & # 34 ; in Phonebook Menu & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; Phonebook Setup & # 62 ; & # 62 ; & # 62 ; View ; 3- voila , only primary numbers are displayed.The way Motorola has implemented this is not very intuitive as Nokia 's implementation ( refer to my owner 's manual dis-like above ) , but I have found Motorola 's implementation to be a little more robust.UPDATE : It 's been nearly three weeks since I 've bought this phone and no buyer 's remorse .	1
I 've had this phone for a while now and here 's what I think.The User Interface has had a bad rap from some people , and yes , it 's not as intuitive as say , Nokia 's interface , but it does have some pros . You can customize every button , including all 4 arrows , and the left and right soft keys . I have my left soft key programmed to go to `` Shortcuts '' and I have every function I need right there . And of course , after a while of use , you will get used to the interface.The volume of the phone is decent . I have no problems hearing other people , and they have no problems hearing me . Speakerphone works great too . My boyfriend says that he no longers feels like he 's talking to someone in a tunnel when I use speakerphone for our calls . The only volume problem I can see is that at the highest volume ( 7 ) , it is still slightly hard to hear your phone ring . One other thing - this phone has way cool ringtones.The address book issue is this : If you use your SIM card to store your addresses , then no , you will not be able to have multiple entries for one person . But if you use your phone 's memory to store your numbers , you can have many many numbers stored to each entry . I have all of my numbers stored on my Powerbook 's address book , so I 'm not too worried about having them on my SIM card . And if you have a MAC , iSync works wonders with syncing numbers/calendars to the RAZR ... .now THAT 'S cool ! The screen is very large and clear . I have no problems seeing it in dark or even bright light . I have had no problems with reception with Cingular so far . In fact , I have a stronger signal in most places than my previous phone ( Nokia 6230 ) Overall , I am very pleased with the design , functions , and asthetics of this phone .	1
If you look carefully at these so called `` bad reviews '' you will notice most of them either do n't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer , EVERY brand , EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever , we ordered 2 , I got the Black one she got the silver one . Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a `` shared plan '' from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order , I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each , now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your `` Cell phone Numbers '' right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a `` single 700 rollover mins shared plan '' before we even got the phones in our hands , so there is no problems at all in that respect . Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked , I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to `` My Account '' from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account , how many minutes , the plan , when the next bill is due , etc etc , and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area , I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars , I do n't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far , the phone gets a great signal , and Cingular `` in my area '' puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip , she was about 150 miles away `` With NO ROAMING charges '' btw our last cell phone service `` Alltel '' would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength , we both put phone in `` Speaker Phone '' mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases , I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all , and it was a FREE call `` Mobile to Mobile '' .We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life , most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I 've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it `` needs '' charging , so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges , So I 'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge , and that 's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it 's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke . I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me , either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet , and also insurance for $ 4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone , thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the `` address book being slow '' not even sure what that means , I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me , maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds ? dunno.As for searching through the phone book , they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person , NO you do n't , you have the option to show numbers any way you wish , either by `` Name '' or `` Speed dial # '' or `` Voice name '' or even by `` Email '' and with or without a picture of the person.Someone said it took them 5-10 seconds to open address book and dial a number from it , well I just now did it in under 3-4 secs , not to mention if you have it set for `` Voice command '' it takes 1 sec.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries ? then set it for `` list only '' `` no picture '' and by `` primary number only '' , simple . You can also separate numbers even further by putting in `` Categories '' such as `` Business/Personal/General/VIPs '' Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & # s it thins them to category.When you have `` primary number only '' listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to `` Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers '' once again very simple and easy to use . I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about `` ear piece volume too low '' the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the `` volume '' is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used , make sure your ear is right at the `` top edge of the phone '' , too low and volume will sound low . Someone mentioned to take out the little blue cover , do NOT do that since it has nothing to do with ear piece volume , there are 4 speaker holes along the top edge of phone just make sure center of your ear is even with these holes and volume is just as loud as any phone you have used.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent , gets a great signal , has way more than enough features for me , works very well for its intended purpose `` PHONE '' seems to be very well made , nice size , looks great , has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far ... ... The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting , especially if you are in the dark , well that same screen outdoors under `` sunlight '' is virtually unreadable . So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes , but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone.UPDATE : 4/08/08My wife and I still have both of these phones , neither of us have had even one single problem with them and its getting close to 3 years of everyday use ( these are our only phones , we only have cell phone service no land line ) .The only slight problem we have had in over 2 1/2 years is when we finally had to change the battery we went with the cheap $ 5 battery that you can find several places and they were no where even close to as good as the original battery but that is not the fault of the phone.These phones have preformed flawlessly and we use the hell out of them .	1
I live in an area where Cingular service is really good ; I have experienced virtually no dropped calls . The phone itself is not one that I picked or researched extensively . My son tossed my old phone into the wash and thanks to the insurance I had previously purchased I got this phone as a replacement . It is longer and wider than my old Motorola phone but it is also thinner . I was concerned about the thickness and durability . This phone is also metal so I feel more confident using it than I did my previous Motorola phone.My old accessories do n't fit even though it is the same manufacturer this just seems silly but what can you do ? I purchased Motorola Phonetools 3.0 by Avanquest for my previous phone . I plugged my new phone in and the program automatically updated to 4.0 and it prompted me to add a profile for my current phone . With this program I can make my own ring tones and manage my address book and sync it with Outlook so I do n't have to worry about saving my settings to my sim chip . I also put my favorite picture of my phone dunker and his brother in my phone 's memory and I use it as my wallpaper.My Bluetooth accessories work better with this phone than my previous Motorola . On that phone the connection between the earpiece and the phone would suddenly stop functioning . I could not hear anyone through the earpiece or using the phone and to make it function I had to power the phone off and on each time I used my Bluetooth headset - annoying.The Razr and my Jabra work well together . It works great for voice dialing in my experience and I can answer the cell and drive - though I rarely do this because I am one of those people who actually like to be unreachable sometimes.So I am very happy with this phone but in fairness to other reviewers I did not have specific expectations when I acquired this phone .	1
I had a Samsung X427 before this and it was awful . Dropped calls , poor reception , would n't hold a charge . This phone changed my opinion completely . It does everything I need and then some , and the camera/video is a bonus . The only downside and the difference between 4 & 5 stars was that it did not behave well with my Jabra EarWrap-the remote button did not work-and the speakerphone is a joke . But speakerphone is not really what I needed , it was reliability and function.Really a far step forward-I recommend it for anyone needing a reliable phone .	1
I bought this phone because it was a Editors choice in a leading computer magazine . I would have preferred the Motorola V3 Razor but that is still far too expensive and I have found that this phone is basically the same as the Razor just not as thin or stylish.Plus points of this phone include : - A beautiful screen . It is large , bright , and has excellent resolution.- very good pictures from the camera . I ca n't believe that it is just .3 megapixels ... of course you wo n't be able to blow them up into posters or anything like that but for viewing on a computer or even the occasional 3x5 print the pictures are very good.- excellent sound quality from the speaker so your ringtones and the speakerphone sound great.- very nice construction with a easy to grip rubberized metal trim and back.- the button layout is very nice with a dedicated button for taking pictures and volume buttons on the side . Also of note is that most of the buttons are user programable.- the phone also has voice dialing and picture caller id ( although the pictures are very small and do not appear on the external display ) - the bluetooth is very easy to set up and use- it is a true Quad band phone that can be used worldwide ( although it has to be unlocked first ) .- excellent battery life . I ca n't believe some of the reviews that say it needs to be charged every day ... I find myself charging the phone after about 4-5 days with moderate use . Of course I have the screen saver turned off and I make sure that the bluetooth is disabled when I am not using it so maybe that is why I have great stanby and talk times . Also the place where I purchased my phone told me to charge it for 24 hours before the first use ( to condition the Li battery ) so maybe this has helped to increase the battery life.The Negative points about this phone include : - the blue external display looks cool but I think it would be more visible if it were typical backlit black on white LCD ( like on the motorola v180 ) - the instruction manual ( like most Motorola manuals ) does not do a good job of explaining all the features so you will have to play with the phone a little bit to fully make use of all that this phone can do.- Even though the pictures from the camera are excellent , the video quality is not so good . Of course this is a cell phone not a video camera so I guess it is about what you would expect . Also there is no flash on the camera ( unlike some other camera phones ) so low light pictures are not that great.- there is no USB port on the phone so unless you want to buy a motorola cable , the only way to transfer pictures to your computer ( and mp3 's to your phone ) is via bluetooth . ( HINT : you can get a bluetooth adapter for less than $ 20 bucks so do n't waste your money buying the motorola cable . Also with the bluetooth adapter you wo n't need any special software to transfer pictures or mp3 ... just use the software with the bluetooth adapter ) .- the connector for the charger has the typical motorola design so occasionally you have to jiggle it to get it to fit in just right but make sure that your PRESS the button on the connector before removing it or else you will damage the contacts ... this may be why some users are having problems charging their phones- the phone only comes in blue so it does not look as cool as other motorola phones like the v180 or the razorAll in all this is the best phone that I have owned . User 's who complain about call drops and bad signals should be complaining about the carrier and not the phone . Personally I have noticed that ever since the Cingular and AT & T ; merger , signal quality and call quality have both declined . A Cingular rep told me it is temporary until they are able to better integrate both networks ... this makes sense because I have only had this problem since I switched my SIM card to the new Cingular SIM that makes use of both networks .	1
I 've had this phone for about four months now , and I have n't had a single technical problem with mine , even after a couple of typical drops on paved surfaces . I do charge it every night ; however , I 've found that the Bluetooth radio makes a very significant difference in battery life , which may spur some of the complaints about the shorter battery life than the V400 ( no BT capability on that one ) . It is possible to turn off the BT radio if you do n't need it for any accessories or connections . My charge lasts for several days if I do this . I really do n't feel inconvenienced by charging daily and leaving BT on , though.In general , the phone has great screen quality ( compared directly to my friends ' V400s ) , great speakerphone and polyphonic ringtone capability , great sound quality at both ends , great voice dialing performance ( very useful with headset ) , and I 'm entirely satisfied with the camera , considering it IS a cellphone camera.I 'll admit the interface was a bit cumbersome at first , but it 's VERY customizable with changeable function keys , shortcuts , and menu orders . I find mine very efficient since I 've tweaked it to suit my tastes and usage.Additionally , contrary to some previous reviews , I have successfully transferred both information ( phone book , etc . ) and media ( pictures , ringtones , etc . ) to and from the phone with my Bluetooth adapter on my PC , without using Cingular 's services . I did have some trouble getting it to work initially , but I found that it was my firewall getting in the way ( remember , Bluetooth IS a network connection ) .I suppose my one complaint is the conspicuous absence of games ( only comes with a Bejeweled demo ) , but in the end it does n't really bother me . I could buy a game for $ 4 if I really wanted one.Overall , I find the phone very feature-rich and high quality , efficient to use once customized , and as rugged as the average cellphone .	1
Bottom LineStrongly recommended . This phone replaced a highly-rated NEC 525 so my assessment is largely in comparison to it . Based on my research , the V551 has virtually the same features as the much more expensive Razr V3 ( although not as thin and made largely of plastic rather than brushed aluminum ) . From the many online reviews I 've read , early versions of the V551 had problems with lockups and dropped calls . I have n't seen many of those types of comments lately so I 'm assuming Motorola worked the kinks out.Pros -- Very good reception and sound quality . Gets three and four bars in my office ; I had to stand by the window to use the NEC -- It 's nice looking ; the body is mostly plastic but appears solidly made ( the NEC was plug ugly ) . Nice raised number keys. -- Calls and rings can be made very loud ( which is good since I often carry it in a pocket or briefcase , or have it in the car with the sunroof open and music blaring ) -- Decent quality pictures for a phone camera -- Bluetooth -- MP3 ringtones ; also extensive selection of built in ringtones ( although most aimed at young users rather than professionals ) . -- Good speaker phone function -- EDGE makes for fast web browsing -- Excellent procedure for downloading and saving data via WAP -- much easier than the NEC -- I can now access Hotmail which I could n't with the NEC -- Nice looking screen -- ITAP text entry system works better than the similar function on the NEC -- Good voice dialing ( the voice tags on my NEC simply took me to that phone book entry and did n't actually dial which the Moto does ) -- Ability to change ring volume and method ( to include a useful vibrate then ring method ) with external keys is very handy ; ring volume can be made very loud -- Buttons and functions are highly customizable -- Very good date book -- Quad band ( I 've used my NEC and the Siemens it replaced in about a dozen countries , including Iraq ) -- Nice price ( $ 74 from AT & T ; ) Cons -- Organization of the phone book is a common complaint but once I figured it out , it 's fine . You can store five numbers and an email per entry . ( You must save entries to the phone not the SIM , and organize by primary listing ) . It 's not the best -- the NEC allowed multiple emails plus other information -- but it works. -- Battery life is also a complaint but I found that by following Moto 's recommendations -- completely discharge and re-charge it the first few times -- it 's fine . Now I can go 3 to 5 days between charges with normal use . ( As another reviewer noted , the battery life was short for the first few days I had it but then improved dramatically . ) -- Physically the V551 is a bit thick compared not only to my NEC but also to my previous Motos -- a Star Tac and V60 . But it does fit in a suit jacket pocket -- Speaker phone function can only be turned on during a call , not before -- Maximum time before the screen turns off for power saving is 20 seconds . You have to touch a key to make it come back on . This can interfere with things like downloads -- Screen icons are small and fuzzy ; the user 's manual does n't explain what they are -- Small navigation keys , but that 's the price you pay for a relatively small phone -- Of the three built-in skins , two are glaringly bright and tacky . As with the ringtones , Moto was clearly focused on young users rather than professionals -- When using a Bluetooth headset , the V551 will only use a cheesy , stock ringtone -- personal ones will not work -- You have to go through the recognition routine with a Bluetooth device every time you use it ( although this only takes about ten seconds ) . -- Works great with a Moto Bluetooth headset but I 've had less luck linking with a non-Moto Bluetooth adapter for my computer -- Lousy user 's manual -- Lousy user 's manual -- Did I mention the lousy user 's manual ? ( this is inexcusable ) -- Voice dialing is not universal . In other words , it `` learns '' one voice rather than responding to anyone saying the correct word or phrase. -- Stubby antenna ( although this is a trade-off : I get better reception than with the internal antenna on my NEC ) -- I would have been happy to pay the extra fifty cents or so it would have cost to have real metal on the front instead of plastic made to look like metal. -- The synchronization software ( Motorola Mobile Phone Tools ) and cable cost extra . I have not been able to make it function . Motorola 's support is utterly worthless -- I asked for help online and they told me to call them . Two attempts led to disconnects after 10-15 minutes on hold without ever getting to an actual tech person . The software developer -- BVRP -- is trying to help but has n't been able to fix the problem . I may seek a refund from the online vendor and look into alternative sync software .	1
I did n't like it but my husband seems to think that it works great for him and uses it often .	1
I owned one of these for about three months , then it started to fall apart . It was $ 30 at Best Buy . I have n't replaced it , as $ 30 is a *lot*. $ 10 ? I 'm buying two more . I can be moving 20 mph on my bicycle , talking to someone , with no problems . It has far better sound quality than my 'backup ' , which is a Jabra with no boom . The ear volume is adjustable on my phone , and I 'm wondering what phones other reviewers have that wo n't let them adjust the volume ?	1
The only downside with this headset is that the first one I owned broke after about 2 years of use . First the ear `` hook '' piece broke off . Then the 2.5mm jack broke while in a plug - I 'm only glad it was in an adapter and not my phone at the time or it would have ruined the phone.I bought another one and it works fine . Hopefully that broken 2.5mm jack was a one-time thing . Otherwise the sound quality and fit are great . The reviewer who says the ear piece is too snug should use a smaller ear piece - there are 3 different sizes that come with the headset for each ear .	1
I purchased this headset from BTO , Inc to fit thePalm Centrosmartphone , which as a 3/32 '' ( not 1/8 '' ) headphone jack . This headset fits and works perfectly.If you are familiar with the mono headset that shipped with older Palm or Handspring Treo phones , this headset is a stereo version . The buds are hard plastic in-the-ear type with a thin cushion ( which you must install without tearing ) . The microphone is on the left bud , and is held close to your mouth because the left side wire is much shorter than the right side . The mic has an answer/hang up button . And the set is terminated by a 3/32 '' four conductor plug.The build and sound quality of this set are good . The plug has strain relief and the wiring is thin but more rugged than expected . The buds have bass ports and the mic capsule is a reasonable size . The Centro has a microSD card for storing MP3 tracks , and this headset does a good job reproducing the dynamic range of classical music.There are better headsets available . But if you want a headset to fit a stereo Treo with a mic , answer button , and decent sound , it 's hard to find one that costs less . Four stars instead of five because the bud cushions are thin and tear easy .	1
Great sound , I use my phone for music at the gym so I am moving around and I have had no problems . To get it any cheaper , you have to steal it !	1
Great price for Motorola branded batteries . Works great and seems to last as long as original battery did when new .	1
The first battery received lost it 's charge overnight..the vendor replaced it with another look alike that is working better.Not totally happy with the quality but the vendor was responsive and that is important for discount item transactions like this .	1
Oem battery , works great and received in just 3 days ! Love the razr but original battery died , bought an aftermarket , it only lasted 9 months , so back to OEM .	1
I lost the charge for my Motorola RAZR V3 , and I found this cheap one , surprisingly , it works so great that i asked my frds whoever lost the charger to buy from eforcity	1
I read other reviews before I 've bought this battery and decided to try my luck anyway for 7 bucks : ) so , I 'm here to tell you that it works nice to me , I own it for the month already and still I have 3+ hours for talking and 3 days for stand by ! ! ! Is n't it great ? ! Of Course it is : ) I 'm glad that I 've tried it , I was even thinking if it wo n't keep the power for 3 hours for talking I 'll need to go in AT & T ; store and by original one for $ 40 , the old one that was going with one kept the power for one and a half years . Will see for how long this one will leave .	1
Anywhere else this battery costs at minimum 4 times more . Even with the shipping it 's a steal . Grab two or three for backup.A-1 service from A-1 Accessories .	1
I was leary about purchasing the battery because it cost so little . But I called the vendor and asked if it was a new battery and not used or re-conditioned . The vendor assured me it was a new battery . It has performed well so far .	1
I bought this thinking I was walking into a bad deal . However , it has been a great battery . I must say , for the price , I was extremely well pleased .	1
I should clarify my review title by saying that this battery is pricey compared to the non-Motorola batteries which mostly received negative reviews . I know someone who bought one of these and had good experience . However I decided to pay more and go for a Motorola replacement . It works well . If it lasts as long as my original Motorola battery ( 1.5 year ) , I 'll be very satisfied .	1
Replacement batteries are working great . They take a charge , hold it , and last seemingly as long as the original when it was new .	1
I had my doubts because this product was priced so cheaply , but it has performed very well now and has given my phone noticeable life . I would highly recommend this product .	1
Product arrived on time . I charged the battery fully and it works as intended with no problems in my phone .	1
Ca n't go wrong for under $ 25 . I bought this when it was $ 40 and I 've been very happy . I replaced my Jabra headset after I lost it . I think this is actually more comfortable . I 've never had any of the issues described here . It 's seems to be very clear and nobody on the other end has ever complained about not being able to understand me . Maybe I just talk louder than everyone else . : )	1
Battery powered so no charging . Item delivered on time , was as described . It works perfectly with very true sound and easy to pair to my phone .	1
The battery life on this unit is great . I can use it daily for an hour or so every day , on a single AAA for at least two weeks . ( It appears from other reviews that this can vary a lot . ) I use this headset with both a Treo 650 phone , and a Apple PowerBook G4 . On the Apple , I can use it as a generic output device . ( I 'm sure the same goes for other headsets . ) The signal is strong enough on the Apple to use it from about 30 feet away ; on the Treo 650 , the signal is not nearly as good.The sound is OK . It 's not the best . If it 's noisy -- e.g. , like driving , or in a hotel room with the air conditioner fan blowing full-blast -- OR if the person on the other end is not talking very loudly , then it 's sometimes hard to hear.It 'll drop audio -- i.e. , the call goes back to my cell phone -- when the battery is getting low . You can milk it a while longer , but that 's really your first clue about the battery.The earpiece is OK ; it 's not as secure as I 'd hope . If you 're outside in a gust , you may want to hang on to it.Also , people on the other end sometimes can tell I 'm on a headset with this one -- they mention that I sound a little staticky.This is my first bluetooth headset , so perhaps my rating is higher just because it 's a nifty gadget . But the battery life on this is really the winner -- my work-mates have rechargeable headsets , and it seems like they 're always having to charge them . I use rechargeable NiMH AAA 's , and they just last a really long time with this unit .	1
This is a nice case that resembles a wallet because it holds your credit cards and papers while still keeping your Galaxy Note II protected .	1
Samsung Note 2 lets face it is a large phone ... Howeva I am all about putting it in nice cases . This case hits a stars . Has a credit/ID slots and a money slot - Love that - so I do n't have to carry a purse . Plus the strap is nice to have on wrist while on the phone ( you know how crazy people are now a days running by snatching phones , extra secure ) . Best parts phone is secure in case holder when flip case over open . There is an appropriate hole in the back of case for the S-pen removal . Also the phone button closes versus most magnetic closure cases out here.Only con : No Speaker hole in front to close case while talking on phone.Howeva regardless -- highly recommend . Might get another in another color .	1
Bought this for my girlfriend 's s3 , and she loved it . Having that wrist lanyard is really helpful , and it is a nice looking case for the phone . Fitment is perfect . Also the slick outer sheen is pretty easy to clean off when stuff gets on it , however its somewhat easy to leave indent marks/scratches on if left in a purse with pens or anything sharp.One thing I hadnt noticed from the sellers page was that this case is held together by a snap . It seems like they have now added one picture in which you can kind of see it from the side . This is no a problem , it holds well , but a magnet might have been nice.The only real drawbacks are that when you keep the cover closed for a while , it may leave small horizontal smudge marks on the phone from the card pockets . Also extended use of the phone in this case will cause it to heat up faster than on some of the other cases I 've tried . Both of these can be mildly annoying , but arent really a big problem .	1
This is the perfect case for my phone . Even having a big phone the case makes it feel small and easy to handle.It gives great protection can even take a drop or a slip out of the hand . I love this case the black patent leather makes it a very stylish case .	1
Will take nothing away from the product . For my personal taste it was a bit bulkier than I prefer . Quality is good no complaints otherwise .	1
This case not only looks fantastic , but it very functional and convenient to carry all the necessities ( credit card , id , cash , etc . ) it only smelled like plastic for the first 2-3 minutes after I opened it , which did n't bother me at all . Overall this case is awesome . It 's cute , and seems sturdy and well made . Buy it !	1
this case is perfect , the shiny black is just what my girlfreind was looking for , looks sturdy enough to last forever , and there is mini pockets inside the cover , verry nice thanks	1
I actually like this case a lot . I was worried about the price and it being a TPU and all . I have to say , I have a feeling this one is going to last a lot longer than the Spigen Neo-Hybrid I owned for 3 months before it broke . And even better , I can fit all of my charging and headphone devices perfectly , unlike the Spigen . It does n't make the case bulky , as it may look . It actually feels quite nice in my hands . Overall , I really like this case . If that happens to change eventually , I will absolutely re-review it !	1
Bought it as a present for my mom to match her purse and she loves it ! She likes it better that her & # 34 ; signature & # 34 ; case becasue of the quality	1
It was a very nice case . Well made GREAT color ... ... .. But I bought the wrong size . Had to send it back .	1
Not pleased with the first cover she ordered for her Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , my wife is loving this one by BoxWave . She loves the compartments for her ID , credit card , and money . The fit is good , no problems taking pictures or talking . She likes the carrying strap as well , and the case 's flexibility .	1
The BoxWave provides good protection for your Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , and does n't provide near as much bulk as the LiviTech Defender Double Layer Hybrid Hard Case . I still would recommend the Samsung OEM Case over them all .	1
This is a great case for the Note 2 . I had been undecided about whether to use a cover such as this or a belt holster as I 've always used . I wound up ordering both , this and a REIKO case . They both work good separately , but not together . If you try to use both , it is almost impossible to remove the Note 2 from the REIKO as it becomes stuck due to the tight fit . I decided to use the BoxWave exclusively and have not been dissatisified with my decision . I simply slide the Note 2 into my front pocket . And no , the phone is n't too big for my pants pocket.The pros for this case is that it makes the Note 2 look stylish , and due to the rubbery feel , it makes the phone feel quite stable in my hand ; however , the rubbery feel does n't interfere with it going in and out of my pocket . If I had to come up with a con for the BoxWave Tuxedo Suitup case , it would be that due to its glossiness , it shows fingerprints , However , they wipe off easily.In summary , I would definitely order one of these cases again .	1
I received this item in Dec. Been using it since then . Wanted to make sure I liked it and it did its job . It is light weight and does not add any bulk to the phone while protecting it . Well worth the money . I am thinking of ordering a few more of these in different colors . : - )	1
My favorite TPU case . Offers enough protection and grip , can take off easily and slip it right back on . I can slip a couple of cards and bills between the phone and the case if need be .	1
This case is a little thicker than my old TPU slim case but I expected that and really like the firmness of the material used . No gaps or flimsy rubber on this . This is my everyday case now . Fit and finish as great and feels good in the hand .	1
Case is very nice , great , solid fit . The feel is very nice and minimal size . The buttons seem to be a bit hard to press for me , volume and on/off , but probably just need to get used to the feel . Nice case , good build , solid fit . Slides in to pocket without issue .	1
This case has a tackle touch which makes it nice to carry . Not worried about dropping the phone.Fits well and works just fine , thank you very much . .	1
Fits well , offers decent protection and gives the phone good grip at a good price . I would order this case again .	1
This thing is sweet . I have to say that so far this is the best case that I have tried out from Box Wave . It slipped on very snug and was even harder to get off . Although it is not impossible to get off it is difficult which is a good thing in my book . This case is very comfortable in the hand and just feels right . All controls were easily accessed and everything on my Galaxy Note 2 worked fine with the case on it . The only thing I did n't like was that this does not come with a holster . I like to use holsters and carry my phone on my belt . Well I did manage to find a holster from one of my earlier purchases for my phone and it fit the Box Wave like a glove . It was from one of those 2 piece rubber and hard plastic cases that Amazon sells for about $ 7.00 . I ca n't remember the name but as soon as I do I will update this review so you can order this case and holster combo just for the holster . I have had the chance to locate the name of the case and holster and it is from `` Rhino '' brand . The ones I have were `` Black Rhino '' . I hated the cases but the holster is a perfect fit for this Box Wave case .	1
Bought to replace another that I bought for my wife a year ago and it is great . Not heavy , stand work the way it should and it fits like a glove . Gives grate stability to the slippery side of the phone and allows for one handed function .	1
I have bought many cases for many different cellphones and this is the first case that compelled me to write a review . This is by far , THE best case I have ever had . It fits so perfectly , you 'd think that it was meant to be a second skin for the phone . and the fact that it does n't add a lot of bulk , but feels like it will protect very well makes it that much better . This case is worth more than double or triple the price . I wish they made this exact case for every phone . It would be my go-to case . Please make one for the HTC ONE !	1
First , I 'm a huge fan of TPU cases ; and hate silicone ones . There 's a huge difference , in case you , the reader , does n't know . TPU is better ... LIGHT YEARS better ! But there are a lot of not-so-good TPU cases out there ; and not because there 's anything wrong with the TPU . Rather , it 's because they 're cheaply made , or not cut precisely accurately ... that sort of thing.This particular case is the very epitome of precision cut . It 's perfect . Every hole is centered on whatever it reveals beneath ... the camera lens , the flash , the speaker , the mic holes , the earphone jack , and , of course , the stylus . Note that there 's no holes for the power button or volume rocker ... ... and that , TRUST ME , is the way it SHOULD be ! So many of these TPU cases make cutouts for the power button and volume rockers , and that 's a huge mistake . If you 've ever cleaned an old-style computer mouse -- you know , the ones with the hard rubber ball partially hanging down out of the centerhold on the bottom -- if you 've ever open one of those up and cleaned one , then you 've seen the dark kinda ' fuzzy weird stuff that you must scratch off all the rollers and whatnot . That stuff is body oil , mixed with skin cells , mixed with dust and hair , mixed with lint from the mouse pad , mixed with godknows what else . It gets into and under and around virtually anything which humans touch ... ... including down inside and around the hardware buttons on a smartphone ! And when that stuff gets in there , buttons stick , and phones either wo n't turn on or off , or ca n't have their screens awakened properly ... or , one of the common ones which people often do n't realize is caused by a sticking power button : boot loops ! Having a TPU cover which covers the power button and volume rocker helps eliminate that problem . Of course , there 's still the electromechanical HOME key that 's uncovered ; and if you look on YouTube you can find examples of phones which their owners mistakenly believe are broken , because their HOME keys cause weird behavior ; but , in fact , all that 's wrong is that over time the HOME key has gotten all gunked-up with the aforementioned body oil , mixed with dust and hair , mixed with ... well ... you get the picture.There 's not a lot we can do about the HOME key problem ( if it 's a hardware electromechanical one , as opposed to a simple capacitive on on the glass ) , but we sure can keep the crap out of our power buttons and volume rockers with TPU cases that cover them ... ... and this one does ... and magnificently . It even has nicely-molded buttons ( as opposed to cheap TPU cases which just have a sort of bulge with a little bit of texture added to it . This case is simply molded beautifully ! This case is special for another reason , too , which many people , I 'll bet , do n't know about , and that 's precisely how its sides wrap up and onto the front face of the phone : the bezel around the glass screen . It 's really nice , and very different from how other TPU cases do it.Remember that the Note II is kinda ' unique in that the very , very edges of its glass screen are n't like almost any other phone . Most phones have a perfectly flat piece of glass as their screens ; and then there 's the metal bezel of the case which almost comes into contact with the glass 's edge all-'round ; and the top of the bezel is ever-so-slightly elevated above the flat plane of the glass screen , so that if you place the phone on its glass screen on a table , the glass , itself , it not actually touching the table because that bezel edge is holding it a millimeter or so up off the table 's surface.Well , the Note II 's glass is actually higher up ( when it 's lying on its back ) than the bezel edge of the case ; and , in fact , the very , very edge of the Note II 's glass seesm to roll over and down toward the case 's bezel . As such , if you lay the Note II on its face ( on its glass , it 's the glass that actually touches the table . This makes for a bit of nightmarishness with regard to screen protectors ; and one maker of them ( REALOOK ) manufactures two dry-apply versions for the Note II : one that sits on just the flat part of the Note II 's screen , and so leaves a wider-than-normal amount of uncovered glass between the edge of the screen protector and the actual glass edge ; and then they make another ( the REALOOK `` 3D '' screen protector for the Note II ) that 's molded to actually wrap over the rounded edge of the Note II 's glass , and `` hang '' down over it , so to speak , to make the protector 's edge come closer to the case 's bezel , and causing it to COMPLETELY cover the glass and its rounded edge.With most TPU cases , the TPU sides wrap up and over onto the face of the glass ; and with totally flat screen protectors which leave a half millimeter or so between the screen protector edge and the bezel , that 's fine . The TPU case actually ends-up covering that edge and make it look like the screen protector is covering the entire glass . But with the REALOOK `` 3D '' style screen protector that wraps over the edge , that other kind -- the most common kind -- of TPU case can cause the edges and corners of the 3D screen protector to curl or pull up.This BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp case is magnificently shaped so that its edge around the glass protrudes up higher than the plane of the glass , so that if the phone is laid on its face ( on its glass sreen ) , the glass does n't touch because it 's being held a millimeter or so up off the table or desk . But it gets better : That edge `` respects '' the rounded edge of the Note II 's glass , and does n't try to wrap up over onto and cover it . Therefore , the REALOOK 3D screen protector 's edges and corners remain intact and look beautiful.This is a very special TPU case ... different from most others ... and the only kind you can have , actually , if you use either a wet- or dry-apply screen protector whose edges go either all the way to , or over the edge of , the Note II 's glass.Seriously , this thing is PRECISION ... someone REALLY took a moment to figure out how best to cover the unusual Note II ... and got it PERFECT ! The only thing I wish it had was a matte finish back so that it would n't show such fingerprints . The TPU cases out there that are called `` s-style '' or `` s-series '' TPU cases have matte finish on one side of the `` s '' shape on the case 's back , and a shiny finish ( like this case has everywhere ) on the other side of the `` s '' shape on the case 's back . The entire back of this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp should be the kind of matte finish that 's on those `` s '' cases , in my opinion ; or there should at least be an option to get it either way.Sadly , those `` s '' series or style cases are of the type whose side wrap all the way up and over onto and touching the glass , and on the Note II , that does n't work well with most screen protectors . Plus , many of those `` s '' style or series cases have uncovered power and volume rocker buttons . Most of them also leave too much phone uncovered around the camera and flash ... none of which are problems with this BoxWave Tuxedo SuitUp ; and so for me , at least , it 's worth it to just endure its shiny , fingerprint-showing surface.Great case ! Best-of-breed , at least among cases that do n't cause the edges and corners of screen protectors to curl-up and pull-up . If one is not using a `` 3D '' type of screen protector from REALOOK , though ; if one is using REALOOK 's other screen protector that attaches to just the flat part of the Note II 's screen , then any of the other TPU cases for the Note II would be fine ( as long as they cover the power and volume rocker buttons ) ; but the thing is that few of them are made as nicely as this one . Seriously , this one is made very , very well ... very precise . I just love it ! Gregg L. DesElmsNapa , California USAgregg at greggdeselms dot com	1
Nice , looks with good & durable quality & price wise as well . Really works as described ... for my samsung note 2 . I do buy accessories online now ... more way cheaper & find it no difference from what 's on the store which are very expensive .	1
Does what it needs to do at an excellent price . Fits well , seems rigid enough to prevent some damage , and the kickstand is a nice touch . I do n't know how well the kickstand will hold up over time , but works well . The ridge around the front allows me to put the phone face down without it touching a table . The case is pretty compact and still fits into the Smart Dock , although it prevents HDMI from registering . So it charges and goes into dock mode , but does n't seem to sit down far enough to engage the HDMI .	1
Bought this for my daughter for her phone and she loves it . Solid case and easily cleaned with soap and water .	1
A little thick but protects well and the kickstand is stronger than other cases I 've tried.The thicker corners also make it harder to slide into my car dock .	1
The Boxwave case I bought for my Note II ( Bodysuit ) has disappeared from Amazon . This is the same case but with a uniform glossy texture . I had a Boxwave case for my Note I and it was great . This new case is even better . It is thinner and more streamlined , and the buttons work even better . This does n't have cutouts for the buttons , instead it has well-designed buttons of its own molded into the case that push on the phone 's buttons . I like this because the buttons work just as well but they are protected at the same time from crud/damage . Cutouts for the ports/mics/camera/stylus are placed perfectly and sized appropriately . Lastly , this case is made from TPU , which is the best case material in my opinion . It 's firmer so it stays on the phone better than the soft silicone cases and does not pick up lint or stick to your pocket , while still offering some cushion when you drop it .	1
Fits perfect , nice clean look , I am going to buy another one to leave it inside my car just in case .	1
I love the way this case looks and feels . But I wish the buttons were a little more tactile and the side hugged the phone a bit more . Otherwise I feel quite confident in the protection and the kickstand .	1
This cover is very nice , it looks expensive . well built , and built to last . I recommend this cover . Get it	1
The cover fits properly leaving all the necessary openings available for easy access . It keeps the screen lifted off the surface when the phone is put face down . Overall , it does all what I need it to do . Operating the power and volume buttons is a little awkward as it is hard to find the buttons by feel . I would recommend this product for anyone looking for basic protection .	1
I 've bought several hard cases for my note2 and this one is my favorite . It 's easy to put on and take off ( once you figure it out ) . I do n't drop my phone usually so I ca n't say how it will do if you drop it but it only covers the back and the sides . it 's a one piece hard case which I really like .	1
I 'm very pleased with this case . One piece that slips on fairly easily . It 's not real grippy like some but has enough grab that you can hold onto it . Goes in and out of my holder and pocket easy enough . The stand on the back works great ! When the stand is closed it 's flush with the back of the case so it lays flat . Some cases , with stands , have hinges and parts that sick out . The blue is nice and true to on line image . I really like it . The price is amazing !	1
Flawless fit , materials and looks . Mixing clear and frosted materials looks really cool . Adds almost nothing to the width , thickness and weight . Volume buttons a little hit and miss though if you 're not looking at the phone while trying to raise/lower the volume . Would have been really flawless if it had click-able volume and power buttons .	1
Nice looking case . Very inexpensive and seems to fit very well . Excellent value and it feels good in hand . A little softer than I like and therefore most likely prone to losing it 's shape/tightness over time .	1
This is a good , inexpensive case . I use a case to make the phone less slippery so I wo n't drop it , and this one does a decent job .	1
I bought two of these , one for me and one for my girlfriend . She likes going out without a purse or wallet , but would like to hold her ID and credit card on her , and she does manage to fit both cards in this case , but it is a very tight fit.I use my case to hold my ID card for work . It is an RFID card that we use to badge in and out of the building . I always have my phone on me and therefore , always have my work badge on me as well . The case is very low profile and holds up pretty well . It does n't offer a ton of front or top/bottom protection , but if you 're looking for a case to take out to the bar , or something to hold a credit card/id , this works great !	1
As always with these types of case you get what you pay for but at this price , you can buy several and change them out and have something different almost weekly	1
I purchased this item sold directly from Amazon ... It is as `` Genuine Motorola '' as it gets ... It works perfectly ... AT & T ; wanted $ 29.00..Amazon wanted $ 8.38 ... Beware of some other sellers ! ! as their items are not genuine and ruin your battery if they even work at all ! !	1
I purchased this charger to use with my Motorola Razr . I already had one that is essentially identical , except my old phone ( Motorola V5510 has a different sytle adapter than the Razr , which uses a 'mini-USB'.This product is inexpensive , does exactly what it says , which is charges the phone in a car using the auto 's power/cigarette outlet , and it comes with a cute little Motorola 'M ' insignia which lights up bloue during use . At such a low price - I paid less than $ 9 on AMAZON - there 's really no reason to buy a non-OEM charger .	1
I was happy with the service and the product was exactly what the description stated ! Would by here again !	1
I got this because it was good price and its works as intended . Not much can be said , it & # 8217 ; s a car charger .	1
The Charger came in Original Pack From Motorola , The Blue Light is a Plus.Amazon as always Did a Great Job , ( I Ordered On Friday , And put My Hands On it On Tuesday ) .The Cord is a Little Bit Short , But I Use Bluetooth , So No a big issue .	1
Works fine . You plug it in and the phone gets power . What else would it do ?	1
bought one like it at radio shack and believe me this cheaper product is ten times better than their [ $ ... ] dollar piece of crap . will buy more from this vender whenever i need a charger	1
Very nice adapter . It appears to be very well constructed and has a cool lighted blue Motorola `` M '' when plugged in . Much better construction than other cigarette lighter adapters that I have owned . Oh , and it charges my phone ; )	1
Great deal . Motorola all the way . Could not touch the same unit for 3x more .	1
I bought this product after reading several reviews on several chargers . It works great on my Razr V3 and also works on a friends Motorola W315 ... I like the fact that the coiled cord is not as long as on some of the other chargers , and that the M lights up so I can tell when its working . I find it easier to use for these reasons . This idem was cheaper than the aftermarket model offered at Wal- Mart even after paying shipping and the quality is far better .	1
This is no imitation . I bought a knock off because it was $ 15 vs. $ 30 locally . The knock off died in a month . I saw this , at this price , and figured I had little to lose . It charges my cell phone quickly , and does not heat up . Interestingly , the phone does not get hot either , as it did with the first charger I had that came with the phone , as well as the knock off . It is great , and so cheap , I should have ( will ) buy more . This is a no brainer . It is reliable and works better than what I have had . Not much more I can say .	1
The product is just what I expected , the shipping took longer than expected but there was no problem with it .	1
very easy to utilize to charge phones during trips. , enough cord to hold the phone while still attached to the charger	1
Had my doubts about ordering an item like this on the internet but after receipt of the item , I found it works great .	1
There will be no better deal found than this for an OEM brand name charger . Completely recommended . I have purchased them in batches of 10 for my workplace .	1
5 stars ... Excellent device . It does the job and it is well built .	1
This is the original Motorola car charger and is the only one you should consider . It works well and seems to have good protection so that you can start your car with it plugged in without frying your phone or the charger itself.The Motorola logo on the end of it lights up when it 's plugged in , which looks very cool especially at night . I was pleasantly surprised by this as well as the performance and build quaility.I ca n't vouch for the company shipping it out promptly since mine was included as part of my RAZR phone bundle but I would recommend this charger to anyone with a RAZR or PBLE phone .	1
get it . pay a little more and get this . dont buy those cheap stuff with low voltage . it will take forever to charge your phones and other..	1
As a long time user of Walmart earbuds , this was a big step up in quality without the big step in price . If your looking for a practical headset , this is the one .	1
For a corded headset solution , this headset is excellent . I use it with my KRZR . Sound quality is more than loud enough and quality is excellent . One of the main issues I had was that I always have the air vents going in my vehicles . In the past , people on the other end of my calls always complained about wind noise , with this headset that is n't an issue anymore . Additionally , the headset is very comfortable to wear.There is only one item to be careful of . When I first tried the unit I did n't realize that there was a mute function on the control cord . As a result I called a particular person a few times and they could n't hear me . Finally , I figured out what was going on . Of course it was user error . Oh well.I would highly recommend this headset to anyone looking for one .	1
I had a plantronics tranditional headphone MX110 before , and I really like the comfort and sound quality of the product . So , I try this new MX505.Although I am very impress by the sound quality and unique design , it does n't fit me too well . Let me summarize the Pros and Cons first : Pro : Sound qualityDesign fit almost every ear type : the grey area on the ear piece is actually , soft plastic . It makes it very easy to adjust and fairly comfortable to wear.it comes with a spare voice tubesvolumn adjustable controlCon : the cord is a little short for me , and it is around 8 cm shorter than my old MX110 . I prefer to put the phone on a further distance when I use the phone . So , it wo n't bother me when I work . If the cord is at least 30 cm or 50cm longer , it would be great.The design does n't fit me well ... or it would n't wear for long comfortably . The main reason is that it is `` soft '' plastic , not cushioned like the MX110 . Yes , it is able to clip onto the ear much better than other design . I still feel the `` clip plain '' after wearing it for 10 min . It is not a very painful feeling , just not very comfortable.The volumn control is good , but the build quality is not . It uses rather cheap or thin plastic shell . Additionally , the `` Mute '' button is not the `` soft push '' eletonic type . It is the older switch design type , which you push to the right is `` Mute '' and push to the left is `` Unmute '' . It is rather chessy to me.My main suggestion to plantronic is that , please add the cushion on the `` ear clip '' . Secondly , please either take out the volumn control or improve it or offer longer cord . I mean , if the cord is not long enough , why do you need a volumn control ?	1
Sound quality is pretty good . The wind `` technology '' is not bad . Stong winds , blowing sand etc , is going to get heard with this . But for the price it is comfortable . For someone who has to buy special adapters to get Blue tooth devices to stay in my ear I am impressed with this . I wish it had a call end button on the thing . But the mute button is great . I would buy this again . And i like it almost as much as my jawbone . Paring is not an issue with wired devices ... .. ; )	1
Bought a couple of this for my wife 's ipad cause it wont charge on the regular usb port in my car . This worked great .	1
Use this in my truck and its been working very well ! I would definitely recommend . Its also very compact , so I can take w/me when I go to another vehicle .	1
Its nice to have a back up charger and also have it at home and work . You never know when you will need a charge n this one works great	1
Works great ... Not much to say about these things.. Does its job . I need more words for this review to go through.. oh there I am..	1
I have bought many products from boxwave and have never been disappointed . Their products are excellent quality and at a great price . I would highly recommend this product .	1
Small little charger , works as advertised , I 've used it daily for 6 months with no problems . Just what I 've come to expect from Boxwave . Glad I bought it .	1
It works and has a low profile so that I can close the cigarette lighter door when it 's not in use - two things I like . My Android phone warns me to use the ( Verizon ) charger that came with the phone or charging will be very slow . This may just be intrusive marketing by Verizon because the charger seems to work as well as any other and it keeps the phone charged when using it for GPS directions . I have not used it for a tablet or iPad which requires more juice .	1
This charger works great with my Galaxy S3 . When its plugged in it takes up very little room and doesnt stick out of the accessory slot but about a quarter inch . Charges pretty fast also ...	1
I heard about these on Twit.tv / Macbreak weekly . They gave it high praise so I picked up a few . I now have them in all cars and they work fantastic . Two ports , one high Amp one normal and a small for factor make this a winner .	1
This one has lasted quite a while and is priced reasonably . It 's low-profile and reliable.Use just one port for the full 2 amps if you need to charge a tablet .	1
There are better chargers out there but I like the feature of having the dual charger outputs with one fast charger . My wife and I grab this charger anytime we travel . It works in the car and at home .	1
Price wise , i recommend it . Buying it on the store is twice as much . The size is perfect , not blocking or protruding like my old one which is longer .	1
put in my car , and I find I want to charge my phone more now . Did n't know I needed it until I have one . No complaints . Shipped on time .	1
This is an exceptionally versatile charge that works in a car or in any country on the planet with slide on wall plug adapters and voltage regulating circuitry . The 2 USB ports quickly charge devices and the unit itself is rugged and light-weight .	1
I 've never tried to charge both at the same time , but individually it charges both quite well . High amp for the ipad , low amp for the iphone . Great for travel .	1
My car has a DC Power Port in the center console and only about 1.25 inches of space for the cable . This unit fits perfectly and the cable has room to spare.This is a rapid charging unit and works great for power hungry devices .	1
I have a HiSense SERO 7 Pro tablet and a Nexus 4 . I took it on a trip from North Missouri all the way down to Lawton , OK and it was able to keep both charged at 100 % -- the tablet was tackling Navigation and Pandora duties while the N4 was handling phone and hotspot.If I needed another , I 'd not hesitate to purchase one of these again !	1
Out of all the chargers I have bought , this one has been the best ! It charges my wife & I phones simulataneously without a hitch ! It manages to keep charging both while doing GPS draining apps in and the screens on ! Which others ca n't seem to do .	1
This product looks bad with its odd structure however it performs very well and was a big hit with a colleague 's trip to China . I plan to buy one for myself soon .	1
This charges my iPad 3 and my iPhone 4s without a hitch . I do n't know why others are having issues . But it works so well , I got a second one to keep in my folks ' van too for when I ride with them . No complaints . I tried both ports and the iPad shows the charging indicator in both .	1
Love that you can use the same cable to charge my phone in the house as in the car ! Best little car charger device I have seen and used ! It is so small , you ca n't even tell it 's there .	1
I ordered this for my husband and one for myself in white . we are both satisfied with product . He uses it regularly .	1
This car charger has helped me out alot . I can charge dual items at one time.This to me was a great purchase .	1
It did n't fit properly in my 2013 Sonata . I tend to think it 's a design flaw of the car unit more than the charger itself . It seems to work just fine in my friend 's 2013 Maxima -- so I gave it to her : )	1
This adapter is well worth it . It is very small light and decently built the two ports power up well and charge my device perfectly .	1
I purchased this dual car charger to replace aPowerGen Dual USB 3.1A 15w High Output Car Charger . The PowerGen charger is a little large for the inconvenient location of the accessory port in my Toyota Scion xD , and so I liked the low profile of this charger . However , from the reviews , I got the impression that this charger would not charge an Android phone at high capacity . So I also purchased aUSB Charging Cablewhose pin configuration is setup to trick an Android phone to charge in 1A `` AC '' mode . Sadly , the cable I received appears to be a standard USB data cable . However , to my surprise , the `` iPhone / iPod '' port ( the top port ) triggers the `` AC '' charging mode of my Samsung Galaxy Nexus Android phone . So in that case , I do n't need any special cable . I can use the top port for my device , and my wife 's iPhone charges in the bottom `` iPad / iPad2 '' port.This charger extends itself about 0.25 inches ( 6 mm ) out of the accessory port . It 's much more compact than the PowerGen ( which also has Apple and Android ports ) , but there are a few dual chargers that are a little shorter . In our car , the PowerGen has a problem that it sometimes does n't fit well in the port and a connection is n't made without re-seating it . We were surprised by this , because the nearly identicalMediabridge High Output Dual USB Car Charger ( which only is high capacity for Apple devices ) has no trouble fitting in our car . Sadly , this BoxWave charger also sometimes loses connection and we have to re-seat it.For now , I 'm happy with the device . It charges my Android phone in `` AC '' mode and appears to charge my wife 's iPhone . It is relatively low profile ( our cups in the adjacent cupholders do n't seem to bump into it so much ) , and it feels like a sturdy device . I just hope it is able to maintain a reliable connection over time .	1
i was impressed with how small this is compared to others on the market . it charges fast and is holding up well .	1
This is the second care charger I 've had in as many years . Having two USB ports is a plus when you have more than one device which needles a charge . I find this handy car charger indispensable in my work !	1
UPDATE : 18 March 2014After having the case for a week , I absolutely love it ! It has n't broken , however it has broken in nicely and is very comfortable to use . Cards are held securely and the pocket is just deep enough for bills folded in half . Plus , it is very stylish . I have received several compliments and questions regarding where they can get their own . My only complaint is that access to the volume buttons is restricted ( I use them for skipping music tracks while I 'm driving so that I do n't have to turn the screen on ) .ORIGINAL : 11 March 2014I 've only had the case on the phone for a couple hours , but I thought I would give you an update of what works . When I put the phone in the case , it came out almost immediately . Solution : take the back cover off the phone then put it in the case . It holds it much more securely and now I do n't have to worry about it . The case itself seems well made and thicker than I had hoped , but hopefully that will protect the phone well . The one thing I am worried about is how thin the plastic is that holds the phone in the case . I 'll give an update if it breaks or chips like many other reviewers , but until then , great case .	1
the smell , the smell , oh my god , the smell ! ! ! ! ! ! ok i had read the other reviews and i thought , & # 34 ; how bad could it be & # 34 ; ... . can you say brainbusting headache bad ! ! ! ! , i had to leave it in front of an air purifier for DAYS ! ! ! and it still had the aroma of a toxic waste dump ... but in all seriousness the smell went away after about 7 to 10 days , & # 34 ; or i just got used to it , lol , & # 34 ; and it has made one of the best ipad mini cases i have ever used ... and i have used about 100..	1
I was unsure about this case , as I text a lot , and thought it might add too much for just sending a quick text . But this has not been the case . It holds 2 cards , an ID , and a small amount of paper money , but not much . Its not enough to replace your wallet , but enough that I was able to replace my wallet with it . If this style of case is what your looking for , then this is the case to buy . It feels like its of a high quality , leather has worn well so far , phone does not slip out , does a good job of protecting the screen . The only negative I can see is that the leather oils tend to build up on the screen and need occasionally wiping off , but this is a minor issue that comes with the full leather case territory .	1
Given that this is half the price of Twelve South 's bookbook case for iPhone 5 , I expected to get a cheap imitation here.I think it 's fair to say this IS a Twelve South imitation , but it 's a close copy of their iPhone 4/4S bookbook style of case , not their iPhone 5 bookbook case . ( The new Twelve South iPhone 5 bookbook case has a clip to secure the iPhone 5 , rather than sliding the phone into the leather holster and securing with the tab at the top . ) Personally , I loved the Twelve-South 's bookbook case for iPhone 4/4S , but did n't like the new Twelve-South bookbook case for iPhone 5 and I returned mine - it looked cheaply made , it was an extremely tight , awkward fit getting the phone into the clip and the case had large remnants of glue coming out of the over-sized piece of plastic they decided to stick in the ( rather enormous ) hole they cut for the camera . This product is better quality than the Twelve South product . It certainly looks and feels like real leather , although I suspect it may not be ( based on its smell ) . If it turns out to be imitation leather , that would just be a bonus for me , because I 'm mostly vegetarian anyway : - ) If this were the same price as the Twelve South bookbook case for iPhone 5 , I would still prefer this BoxWave case .	1
I bought this for my father who uses a Nexus 4 . The case looks and feels really nice and generally works well . However , there is one significant problem - the inside leather leaves an oily residue on the phone when closed . Suede and leather do need to have some oil retained to keep them in good condition , and while this makes the material look and feel wonderful to the touch , it is a bit of a problem when it comes to these kinds of electronics . The genuine leather on the outside is nice , but I think a synthetic inner lining may be more appropriate for this type of thing .	1
I like the case but I wasn & # 8217 ; t thinking when I bought this case . I normally carry my Nexus 4 in my pocket and this book cover case is kind of bulky making it very uncomfortable to carry in my pocket . Other than that , the case is very stylish and unique , I get a lot of complements for this case .	1
I like the case . it is as described and looks like an note book . if you are interested in that look then it is best . only one thing i dont like . it is that it does not stand horizontal only vertical , other than that very good product quality .	1
This is a great case for the Samsung Galaxy S3 and BoxWave does a great job in making a quality classy durable product . I love that it incorporates my wallet with my phone so that they are together instead of having to carry it separate . It provides access to all the buttons , camera , charge slots , speakers and it makes it look not so obvious when it is closed . Many people often mistake it for a journal , calendar , bible , etc . I also like that it protects my screen in the closed position . A great product .	1
Want to basically eliminate your issues with holding this device in a secure way while maintaining the total coolness of it ? This may be just what you were looking for . Seems to be actual leather unlike many similar cases that claim to be leather and are actually plastic . So if you wear skinny jeans and tend to keep the phone shoved in a pocket , this is not for you . But if you carry it elsewhere and are not concerned with combining your phone with some essential bits of your wallet , this is really really nice . If you tend to travel in a car and wind up carrying both the phone and your wallet into places to eat . This allows you to get three basic things out of the wallet and eliminate the need to carry two into the restaurant.It makes holding onto the phone less complicated by a factor of a googol . Particularly in landscape.The material ( seems to be leather ) is impregnated with a serious amount of oil so when you close the lid , it leaves a mark on the face of the phone . The simple solution to this is to get a paper index card , fold it at the red line on the top and shove the little folded bit in to the slot behind the cards . Not only do you then have the & # 34 ; old way & # 34 ; to fall back on if you need to actually write anything down ) or have someone write something down for you ( , but you add a perfect layer of weightless scratch proof protection to your ever so fragile Nexus 4 screen.For less than what you might pay for the 'official ' bumper ... .no brainer .	1
I am overall pleased with this case - Although I have only had the case for slightly over 2 weeks . I ca n't comment on the long-term durability , but the construction seems to be very good . I previously had the 12 South case for a Phone-I 4s , and that was fine for more than a year . It did show some wear , but I expect that of any case.One reviewer commented on the plastic holder , and I do see their point ; it is a bit thin . So far ( after having the phone in and out maybe 2 dozen times ) I have not had a problem . I have very carefully removed and inserted the phone and have not had an issue so far.The quality of the main leather is nice , and the microfiber interior is also nice . The back of the case appear to be a bit lower quality of leather ( as was the 12 South product ) but is completely on par with the 12 South quality , me thinks.Time will tell , of course ... . So far , happy with the case .	1
This case is great quality and nice Grey color . I have only had it one day so no long term review yet .	1
I 've previously owned a multitude of headsets , but let me tell you I was missing out until I bought a Jabra.I always thought the `` in the ear '' bud and bulky-looking design would be uncomfortable , but it was not . Frankly it is the the most comfortable headset I have ever worn , and I 've worn dozens . I truly forget it is on my head.As for sound quality , everything I hear is clear , with ample volume available . People I speak to report equally clear sound without much , if any background noise.Battery life is great and range is sufficient for me to put my smartphone on the cradle and walk around the house or the office without any signal loss or crackling.Something else I liked was the belt clip . So many headsets overlook the fact that you have nowhere to put your earpiece when you 're not using it . The belt clip is small , just big enough to actually hold the headset , and tucks in right behind the clip for my phone.If you 're not a clip-loving person , the whole headset has an almost flat profile so it fits nicely in a pocket . Other headsets , especially those with flip-out mics feel awfully bulbous in a pocket.One last little `` Gee Whiz '' feature- the vibro-alert . Since I want my phone on the charge/sync cradle whenever possible , this feature really excites me . Instead of being required to actually wear the headset at all times to avoid missing a call when the phone is in the other room , this headset has a vibrate feature to notify me of an incoming call . I call this a `` gee whiz '' feature because I never knew I needed it until I had it ! In summary , there are an awful lot of headsets out there . All of the designs and features can be confusing , but you can rest assured knowing that this headset has everything you need ( and some things you may not ! ) and does so at a very reasonable price .	1
I got one for myself and one for my husband . The sound quality was good on either end , whether I was using it or I was on a landline talking to my husband while he was using it . He loves it . I gave mine to a friend . I have smaller ears so the headset does NOT fit me . If the ear piece going right into my ear the way it should , the headset rests above the top of the ear and falls off . If I get it to rest on the top of my ear so it is on securely , the length going to the end of the earpiece is too long and extends below where it is supposed to fit into the ear . Hubby likes his , back to square one for me . Those with small ears , you might want to find a different style headset	1
After trying the Motorola HS 810 which would feel like it was always falling off or falling off , I tried several Bluetooth headsets at the Sprint and Cingular stores . Other than the Jabra , they were all the same , they had a loop that you hook onto your ear , so they did not fit.This is the only one headset that would properly wrap around my ear and because the ear piece goes into the ear canal , stay anchored . Sound quality is great . The HS 810 would not hold a charge very long . So far so good with this Jabra -- - it holds a charge while the Motorola needed to be charged all of the time.I like the vibrating feature when the phone ringer is turned off -- - no need to share all that noise . As I am on call or expecting calls often when I am out at dinner , this really makes it discreet rather than missing the call and playing telephone tag for awhile.Sound quality is better than the Motorola HS 810 . Jabra seems to work well for those who have small ears and their ear cells make it adjustable.If you do n't need the vibrating feature , try the new Jabra BT 500 which is an upgrade of the Jabra BT 250 , charging can be USB cable which is great as you will not have to take another charger on the trip ! I also have the Jabra SP500 which is a wireless speakerphone and it works great vs. the Motorola speakerphone which I returned . The Speakerphone power and power AC cords for the BT 250v are not compatible , so if you need to use both , you will need two charges , although they are small .	1
This is the best bluetooth device I 've tried . It is lightweight , comfortable , easy to set-up , good sound clarity and it is a very well made and sturdy device . There are n't flimsy parts that can break.The best thing is that the ear peace is fairly inconspicuous as it sits over your ear . I really do n't want to look like Janet Jackson in her Control video as I walk around town or the mall.The problem is in finding replacement ear gels . They are not available on the Jabra site or on any other site . I ended up back at Cingular ( now AT & T ) and they gave me a couple that they had in a drawer .	1
After having replaced my 250 3 times at the verizon store I asked to be given the 250V instead of a 4th 250 , they did and so far so good , I think Jabra knew the 250 had some defects , each 250 i had died ( stopped pairing ) in about 2 months , the 250V seems to have no problems and works much better with my Motorola V710.The fit is great , and the sound is good , could use better noise cancellation , but oh well , maybe in a future model . But overall , I like the 250V . I recommend it to anyone . Just roll your windows up if your driving , or you wont be heard by the other end of your call .	1
This is the best bluetooth headset I 've ever owned ! I 've owned a Sony and Plantronics previously.Sound quality as well as volume is clear for both myself and the person on the other line . And it looks great ... not as bulky as the `` over the ear '' headsets.One `` negative '' that I 've noticed is the short range . If my phone ( Sony Ericsson T637 ) is more than an arm 's length away , I hear a crackling noise .	1
I bought this headset to work with my Audiovox SMT5600 , not listed by Jabra as compatible , but I took the chance anyway . The headset , which I purchased online , arrived with no instructions , but did include the charger , charger cord , belt hook , and several earbuds . A quick search online discovered the manual and pairing was accomplished shortly thereafter . All functions of the headset , including vibrating ring and voice dial , work with my phone . Sound quality is generally excellent -- it 's at least as good as the phone 's earpiece . All bets are off if you 're out in the wind or driving with the window down , precisely the same conditions under which you ca n't hear the phone 's own earpiece either . External noise such as a crowded restaurant does n't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset . The short boom mike seems to be acceptable -- nobody has complained they ca n't hear me . In fact , I can talk pretty softly under most circumstances and be heard just fine . External noise such as a crowded restaurant does n't seem to be a problem for my combination of phone and headset . The battery is advertised to last a long time and it does . I have n't measured any run-down times , but the headset needs to be charged less often than the phone , which with bluetooth on needs a charge every couple days . The headset is light and , for me , comfortable ; after wearing it 12 hours a day for the first several days I forget it is there . The headset is reversable by the simple expedient of rotating the earbud . The dorsal sping of the headset contains one button and one rocker switch . Because of the location of the switches they do not need reversing . The rocker controls volume up and down ; the button combines on/off and answer/hang-up . Press the button to answer or hangup , hold for about 5 seconds to turn off/on . My phone hangs up when the other party disconnects and conveniently , so does the headset . The headset slips into the charging cradle like a knife into a holster . An accessory clip attaches to the charging cradle so you can hang the cradle ( unplugged , of course ) on your belt or waistband to carry the headset when it 's not being worn . With practice , the headset can be put on with one hand . There is no provision for charging in an automobile , which would be inconvenient were battery not so long-lasting . Just pop the headset into the charger in the evening and you 're good for the next day . On an extended trip the charging cord and cradle must accompany the traveler . Other than the lack of a car adapter , which can be remedied aftermarket , my only complaint is that the headset is somewhat wobbly on my ear and the ear bud occasionally works itself away from my ear canal . This is not always immediately apparent until a call is made/received . This is aggravaated by the fact that there is no way to adjust the headset , it being constructed of a plastic shell with a soft lining against the ear . Even the flexible shaft holding the ear bud does not adjust side to side . The headset is rated for up to 30 meters ; this does not include walls or other obstructions . Jabra recommends you wear the headset on the same side that you carry your phone . Practice proves this . Lack of adjustability aside , this is a good headset with outstanding battery life . It 's available at a reasonable price and , thus far , no other headset has wooed me away .	1
I have several of these . I also have lots of bluetooth headsets . For those times where I can live with a wired headset ( which is most of the time ) I use this one . You can sit in a crowded restaurant and the person you are talking to thinks you are alone in a quiet office.Brilliant design that every phone maker should license and build in to their handsets.It has two microphones , one facing your mouth and one facing out . They are cross-connected so any sound that comes through both sides is cancelled . Only sound coming from your mouth is picked up.Stays in your ear without the loop , and seals the ear canal so well that I actually have to turn DOWN my volume.The earpiece is the same as the Shure e2c consumer-grade in-ear monitor ( which I also own ) . So you are essentially getting 1/2 of a $ 100+ in-ear monitor for your phone . That means excellent sound quality . When combined with the best noise cancelling I 've ever used , I can say that this is the best kept secret in telephony.I use this on my cell phone and on my land-line phones . No one ever knows where I am or what kind of phone I 'm on.Highly recommended ...	1
I 've had this unit for about a year , it acts as an ear plug on the ear I 'm wearing it on , and I can hear my caller even in strong winds . The audio quality is great . Since the microphone sits directly in front of my mouth the caller can hear me just fine and many times they do n't know I am in the car . Since it 's a wired unit , there are no batteries to charge and it 's always ready to go . If you do n't mind things in your ear this is a great head set.Update : Moved to an I-Phone from my Palm phone . I had to get a 2.5mm adapter to 3.5 , The phone does not see the headset most of the time and wo n't route calls to it . Same with Blackberry Curve . I hope sure will make a new model for these phones , I miss using it .	1
I was having trouble with wind noise in my convertible causing too much noise to hear phone conversations with normal over-the-ear headsets . This headset has a soft rubber grommet which seals to the inside of the ear . There are several grommet sizes to fit most ears.The seal prevents most wind noise and dramatically improves the perceived volume.The rubber piece is good for about 6 months before becoming hard . 2 of each size are provided .	1
Shure 's QuietSpot headset is the best headset on the market , period . The only problem with it is Shure 's coyness about how it works and why microphone placement is *absolutely crucial* when using it . Once you understand that , you understand everything you need to in order to want it more than you want anyone else's.The `` problem '' with the QuietSpot -- mentioned by other reviewers here -- is not a failure of engineering or quality control , but one of emphasis in their documentation . Barring an actual defective unit ( which will usually not work at all ) there is nothing wrong with the QuietSpot that proper adjustment does n't totally eliminate . I believe that Shure does n't tell you this for fear of alienating technically unsophisticated customers . Since I have nothing to sell you , I am blissfully unconcerned with boring you and can write something useful . Please note that I write this on the basis of a close examination of a working QuietSpot and an educated layman 's knowledge.Observation tells me that , Shure 's QuietSpot headset uses active noise cancellation and it is the only cellular headset on the market that does . This means that the mouthpiece of the headset uses two microphones : one takes in the sound from the world around you while the second takes in the sound from your mouth.Using a trick of wiring , this dual-microphone arrangement uses the sound from the outside world and uses it to weaken the sound from the microphone closer to our mouth . Since both microphones take in surrounding sound , the strongest sound that *isn't* cancelled out is your voice.For this to work , the microphones need very good alignment with your mouth . The QuietSpot demands that you have the 'mouth-side ' microphone pointed directly at your mouth , and the 'world side ' microphone pointed directly outwards without mis-alignments like having the microphone-housing too far below or two far above the side of your mouth , or having the microphone housing turned on its side.The tough part about this is that the boom that holds the microphone can twist and bend while the QuietSpot is in your pocket or case , turning the microphone head around onto its side . If the microphone-head is turned on it 's side , or set too far above or below your mouth , then both microphones pick up your voice with equal intensity and the arrangement does exactly as it 's supposed to : It treats *your voice* like background-noise and sends everything you say off into oblivion.The solution is easy and useful : you have to learn to put the QuietSpot 's microphone in the right place every time you put it on . Once you learn to do this with the windscreen on , you have what is close to the perfect headset . I have used the QuietSpot , standing in bars in New York City with the jukebox blasting and not had to raise my voice very far above an ordinary conversational volume and with the QuietSpot 's noise-blocking earpiece , I could hear my listener perfectly . The two-way noise elimination of a well-adjusted QuietSpot is amazing , providing a sense of intimacy and privacy in conversations that no other headset ever gave me including one or two that cost more.The only other thing you need to know about the QuietSpot is that it is particularly sensitive to wind=noise and unless you intent to never use it outside , it is best to keep the windscreen permanently attached to the unit . You can do this with a needle and thread through the foam , or with a thin-strand of wire . Once you 've done this , you 'll have to learn to make the important adjustment by touch but even then , it 's still easy.Now that you know all this , give the QuietSpot a try . You wo n't be disappointed .	1
I did my research years ago when I purchased this off Amazon . It 's been the best headset for all these years . It followed me through 2.5mm cell phones to 3.5mm cell phones with an adapter . Sadly , the other parties can no longer hear me with it . I even tried a new 2.5 to 3.5mm adapter with no luck . I 'm looking for a new headset and there 's NOTHING like this one . Shure had it right and I wish they still made it . Not everyone likes bluetooth where it 's hard to hear and be heard . I ca n't believe there 's nothing like this on the market anymore . Jabra all has bad reviews and I tried a Plantronics one and returned it . I 'm mourning the loss of this headset and wish it 'd magically work again .	1
I drive a convertible and I have gone through 6 different hands-free devices that did n't work . Wind noise is awfully high with the top down , and my wife could never hear me when I talked on a hands-free . That is no longer a problem . The Shure works great ! It is comfortable , clear sounding and best of all - I 'm audible when I speak . If it had a `` turbo '' button , it would be perfect , but other than that - it is terrific . This is the best I 've seen ...	1
The only thing that I can add to the hundreds of reviews already posted here is my own experiences ( we ordered 2 of these ) .Positives : - No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I ca n't stand those and , apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off , by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives : - My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is , perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.- The charging interface is not a mini-USB but some weird , proprietary plug.- If there is a way to attach this to the left ear , I am not aware of it.At this time , my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present : )	1
I have been using the HS850 for the better part of 2008 and have found it to be a competent little unit . It pairs quite nicely with my Motorola i880 that was assigned by my employer . I find the volume level to be good , though not outstanding . I can hear the other party quite clearly and have had no complaints going in the other direction.The HS850 that I got from Amazon came with a charger and minimal instructions , but I had no issues . After being plugged in for one overnight cycle it was ready to go . The fact that the mike boom also acts as an on/off switch is great , as it tends to conserve battery life . Are there better units on the market ? Most likely . But I feel that I 've gotten some decent value out of this handy headset from Motorola .	1
Seems like Bluetooth headsets are a very subjective experience . I have a Treo 700P and I tried a number of different BT headsets before I settled on the HS850 . I have no problems pairing with my phone and it fits my ear just fine . What sold me on this particular headset was the outgoing sound quality . My wife , mother , and paralegal all report that this is the best sounding headset I have had . It does a good job of avoiding background noise . I previously had the Jabra JX-10 and despite good reviews from others , I found the outgoing sound quality low when there was any background noise . The only criticism I have of the HS-850 is that the incoming sound could be louder .	1
I was stunned . After 2 plantronics ( a 320 and a 330 ) I was tired of earhooks that came loose and dropped calls . I thought it was my provider when my calls got dropped consistently in the same areas on my drive to/from work . But this headset is phenomenal ! maybe one dropped call in a week ... And the off/on operation is great ! Open/close the boom to turn off/on ! I love this headset ... and I do n't say that often	1
I used this headset with the Moto RAZR and it worked flawlessly . I was quite happy with the audio quality ( folks I talked to never complained about background noise , even while driving ) and battery life was more than adequate . Additionally I thought the button functions like mute , swapping calls , etc . were pretty easy to use.Why then , you ask , did you rate it only four out of five stars ? I 'm glad you asked ! My disappointment came when I merged my cell phone and PDA by buying a smartphone , an HP iPaq . The headset connected to the new phone without a hitch and worked flawlessly ... for a while.After anywhere from a day to a month , without any warning , the headset would cease working , refusing to connect to the phone . The fix required hard resetting the phone every time it failed.Since hard resetting at random intervals was hardly an acceptable way to go about business , I called Motorola for support . Without so much as a single step of troubleshooting I was told to contact the phone manufacturer , HP.Would you like to guess what HP told me ? If you guessed `` Call Motorola '' , you win the cupie doll . After calling both manufacturers repeatedly , begging for any input they could give , HP admitted that this headset was not one of a very small group of headsets specifically approved as compatible with the phone . They added that not being on the list does not necessarily mean it wo n't work , after all it worked just fine for random periods of time ( read : I very well could have a defective headset in my hands ) .Motorola 's response never waivered ... `` Go talk to HP . `` I knock off a star not for the very plausible prospect that the problem could lie with the phone manufacturer , but for the less than cordial attitude . Refusing to even troubleshoot a product is called passing the buck . For all they knew , it very well could have been a defective unit but they were too quick to dismiss me to know for sure.My solution was to buy aJabra BT250v Bluetooth Headset with Vibrating Alert [ Retail Packaged ] , after which I had no problems.My summary would be that this headset will likely perform beautifully with any Motorola phone . In fact , it probably works well with many other phones too- just do n't expect to receive any support if your phone is not a Motorola .	1
I believe becuase of the boom it tends to `` flap '' around more so then the likes of say H500 hands free , but that only seems awkward when you have fast head movement , otherwise not a problem . Will not fall off , barely notice it is there , very comfortable , unlike the H605 I tried . The volume is not a problem , loud enough and callers can hear my whispers , I did crank the volume to full . Loud enough but I feel that the H605 I tried was louder , but that is a direct in ear ear piece , but that thing was very uncomforatable so this is a excelent balance of everything , plus a neat boom to flip open and answer , I can slip this on the ear very easy . I like.Just a note , MOT once again has a different charger for this piece , it is NOT a usb connecter , but a pin connector , oh and FYI , to plug it in , it has to be upside down , read the instructions first or you may be scratching you head trying to plug in the charger .	1
This animal is fantastic . Fool that I was I was using a headset with a wire . Every time I turned me head the ear piece would fall out . If I did not turn me head I still had the feeling that this thing was just waiting to strangle me.I reluctantly went to the Motorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset to find what life could be without a wire . All I had to do was initially charge it . The phone did all the rest for me ; it located the headset and immediately started to use it . I have it set for one ring tome just to alert me and then it answers . There is virtually no background noise so you have to say `` Hello '' . The voice comes in clear and loud enough to use in noisy areas . However I just tell the caller to hold on and go to a more appropriate location if I am on foot . I do not want to be accused of being rude or talking to my self . When in the car the warning gives I time to turn the radio off and the caller can not detect that I am mobile . Again I try to make care calls curt or call back from a static location . Other mobile commuters do not get offended by me having a hand up to me ear as I change lanes with out signaling.I keep the phone on my belt but never have to pull it out . I seldom make out-going calls however the phone and the headset are designed to make voice dialing instructions and still not have to pull the phone out . At home I leave the phone on a book case across the room and the headset still works well . When I feel like being a recluse all I have to do is fold the headset and it is turned off .	1
This is one of the better BT headsets that I own . You can hear at your end AND you ARE heard clearly at the other . Talk time is great standby time is great . I let my wife borrow it to see if she liked it , needless to say I have ordered another one for myself . MOTO keeps getting better .	1
I 'm not a Bluetooth techie , so I ca n't compare this to other headsets , but after a month of ownership , I can say it works great.My car has built-in Bluetooth , but everbody tells me that when I 'm in the car it sounds like I 'm under water . Not so with the Motorola - I 'm told it 's crystal-clear.The only negatives I have are : * The multifunction button has no tactile feel - it leads you to press too hard , and too often . This is especially a problem when you 're walking or driving . * The flip out mic is nifty , but the headset tends to wobble if you shake your head at all .	1
I have a Siemens SX66 ( yes , the PDA-phone that supposedly works with no Bluetooth headset out there ) , and I 'm very happy with this headset.It 's reasonably comfortable , has great sound volume , even in noisy environments , people say I sound clear even when in an automobile while driving , and it synchronized right away with the SX66.Most importantly , with the boom mic to flip , you can turn this unit on and off in a fraction of a second . My SX66 recognizes the HS850 headset within a second ( I 'm at the latest Bluetooth v1.1 driver from Siemens/Microsoft - I tried applying the patch from Siemens ' website , but the phone was already at the latest version ) .In short , everything works well , and the ambient noise cancellation features seem to work well , according to the people I 'm talking to.I have n't run this to the point it has completely lost power - I do n't know how long it lasts . At least 3-4 days of idle and 4-5 hours of talk time .	1
This is the only bluetooth headset I 've tried . Using with a motorola e815 with verizon.Calling is good with the voice-dialing with the e815 . Good range for the signal . Some areas you have an increased static interference , but it 's pretty minimal . Occational pop-sounds , not crackling or static for the most part . I guess you could say not a lot of bass and volume ca n't be made `` loud '' but is certainly loud enough for regular calls . Traffic/other loud background noise will wash out calls ... but that 's no different than wired headsets ( or natice cell useage either ) .I have about 50-50 usage of the headset wearing it and leaving it closed in the pocket . I charge it every night , never had a low-battery problem in a day . Talk 2-4hrs a day on average . If in the pocket I can get it out , unflipped and talking on the phone before the call cancels ( it 's close though ) . Thought the flip close was wierd at first , but probably the best interface , would n't want to have to mess with a button to wakeup/connect . Connect time to cell is about 1-2 seconds after opening.Comfort is the worst thing about this headset . Leaving it on for 1-2hrs your ear will be SORE . Half of the headset is very stiff plastic with heavy wire inside , other half is flimsy plastic ( looks like it would be soft on the ear but does n't seem that way ) . Does n't seem to sit nicely in the ear and you ca n't adjust up/down/back/forward . I can see why that is , because the ear part is spring-loaded to keep headset tight against the ear but it 's not good.Worth the money , hope a newer version improves the comfort level .	1
I was one of the lucky few to get one of these free for registering my Motorola MPX-220 . I was skeptical to the whole bluetooth scene , but this headset quickly changed my mind.The device will easily last 3-4 days in standby mode with average usage . The sound is excellent , and people who listen think I 'm talking on a normal phone . The range is great . I can be about 50 feet away without a problem.The best part about the phone is the intuitive on/off . When the microphone boom is `` folded '' out , it turns on . Fold it back in , and it turns off . Simple , yes . But many other headsets require you to push buttons ( or hold them down ) . This makes using it a snap ! I actually have one for my home office and another that I leave in my car .	1
This Bluetooth is MUCH MORE comfortable than my old one . People that I talk to ca n't even tell that I 'm on the device . The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it 's a little bulky , but you ca n't beat the price !	1
I have had my Motorola HS850 Bluetooth for about a week . It replaces a Jabra BT250 which died . While I find the Jabra to be more comfortable the HS850 is far more functional . The compact folding design , the seamless integration with my Motorola V551 phone all make it superior to the BT250 . The Jabra wins only on comfort and richnes of tone.In the interest of honesty I must add that I worked for Motorola Computers Systems in the mid 80 's .	1
I bought this product few weeks back . It works really great with my Samsung t609 . Once you have bluetooth enabled on your phone , everything else works smooth . It has a good voice quality . 1 Small glitch - I found that when I use bluetooth , it uses more battery power from my cell phone .	1
There is a little static and the wind reduction is not the best , but it works great otherwise . people claim to hear me just fine . I can hear people fairly well . Not sure what else to expect . Its also really easy to set up and use .	1
I bought this for some members of my family . All of them love theie headsets . When I speak with them while they are using it , there is little to no background noise . the headset is n't to bulky as others are and youget about 6 hours of talk time . It has been connected to Motorola , Nokia , and Samsung cell phones.I had a faulty one , which was quickly resolved by Amazon . Other than that , the products work perfectly .	1
This wireless headset is a wonderful solution for hands free cell phone communication . It is light , has plenty of battery capacity , and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time . However , it has its dissadvantages . As others have pointed out , this headset produces rather low volumes , unless the volume is cranked all of the way up . It helps if you turn the volume gain up on the cell phone itself , but that causes some echo for the other person that is talking to you . My wife and I each have one of these headsets , and they are both identical with the low volume output issue . They also both emit a light `` hissing '' sound in the earpiece when talking . Overall these shortcomings are outweighed by the positives of this device . It is a very useful and feature rich headset , but be warned that the mild hissing and low volume output will certainly be an annoyance at times . I would still recommend this headset because the cons are far less than the pros .	1
This is a terrific device . I use it with my Motorola RAZR V3 and it works great . I do n't know what I did without a wireless headset . Two things that could be better - first it does n't recognize ring tones from my phone ( but I think that is the phone 's problem not necessarily the headset ) , and second , it occassionally will drop the signal from my phone causing me to scramble to figure out how to go from the headset to my phone . This does n't happen very often so it really is n't that big of a deal .	1
I have pretty low requirements so here 's what I was looking for : * Comfort while wearing glasses . * Only use 1-2 hours a day during commute . * Good sound quality on both ends.The HS-850 met my needs pretty well . I found the headset to be much more comfortable than the Jabra BT250v that I used to have . It is very lightweight , and the earhook fits pretty well . I stick the headset on the charger for a little while when I get home from work each day so I never have battery issues . The call quality is adequate on both ends . I would like the volume a little louder , but it will do . My wife said that she could hear an `` echo '' of herself . This is due having the volume all the way up with the speaker and mic being so close together . However , she could n't tell a difference between having the A/C on high or low in terms of background noise . This was also an improvement over the Jabra BT250v.Here 's what you need to know about limitations . Even though both devices support the handsfree profile , you only get the headset profile when you pair the HS-850 and a Treo 650 . This would seem to be Treo 's issue . Bottom line is that you have to press the multi-function button to transfer calls , and you ca n't use some of the advanced handsfree profile features . This was n't a big deal to me.If you have similar needs/usage expectations , this headset will work well with the Treo 650 .	1
This is the second HS850 Motorola I have purchased , and they both work great . ( The first one developed a crack in the ear loop after three years , but it 's still working and I use it as a backup . ) These used to sell for $ 99.00 , so at this price it 's quite a bargain now . ( I bought the `` bulk package '' ... it 's exactly the same as the first one I bought three years ago ! ) I like the fact that it 's easy to turn on and off by folding the boom . I keep it in the car for hands-free driving . The battery lasts and lasts ... and it 's easy to charge . You can get a car-charger , too ! I like the fact that Amazon guarantees a genuine Motorola product if you buy direct from them , and it was even more of a bargain with no tax and free shipping !	1
I have been very happy with this headset . I use it with a Motorola RAZR V3.My last Bluetooth headset was a Jabra , and it broke after just a few months -- the power button quit working , so it was always on until the battery drained.I love the HS850 since it has no power button ! Instead , you just flip it open or closed . It gets great battery life , since it 's so easy to put it in standby by flipping it closed.I have also used this headset successfully with Skype on both Windows and Mac . The only catch is that it can only be active with one device at a time , so you have to disconnect/release it from your cell phone , before you can successfully use it with Windows or Mac . This makes switching back and forth between your PC and phone a bit cumbersome . Of course , it took a couple of hours to get it working under Windows , but it worked first try on the Mac ; - )	1
I got this for around $ 30 , and it works really nice . My only complaint would be my ear starts feeling sore after wearing it for awhile , and like another reviewer said , it is light enough that it feels like it might fall off sometimes . My husband who is a truck driver said he could n't hear through it over the noise of the truck , but I can use it and hear through it in my car just fine . It would have been good if it came with a car charger too , but thats just wishful thinkin : )	1
I swapped out a Jabra BT250V for this ( see review ) . The Moto is a heck of a lot better - sound quality pretty good on the calls , functions with the Moto E815 no problem - voice dialing works without a hitch , volume on the phone controls headset volume , redial function , etc . The moto is kind of clunky feeling - you know you 're wearing it but not that uncomfortable . Just a big plastic thing hanging off the top of your ear rather than the `` in the ear '' school of thought . I love my Jabra wired headset - do n't know why the BT was so horrible . Works fine in the car as long as the windows are rolled up - affected by wind noise , high background volume , etc . But that 's to be expected . Ca n't comment on battery life - have n't had to charge it again yet . Folding boom switch is great . I turn auto answer off and just fold out the boom to turn on the headset as needed . Overall - the range and sound quality are very acceptable .	1
What a bargain.This is my second bluetooth headset . I waited for a year to write a review because my last one quit working after 3 months due to poor design . This one is still going strong . It 's easy to use , it recharges easily and quickly and the sound quality is great .	1
IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto H700 . It 's larger , and a bit heavier . The boom is larger . But if that 's not an issue , then both are equal IMHO . Both have the cheek problem ! Now for the problem where people can not hear you , or you sound muffled or away from the phone . Wearing your bluetooth , look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it 'll touch that . Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound . Now anything that touches that will impede your voice ... .it 's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone . Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen . Unless you have a very narrow face , chances are this will happen to you and you 'll blame it on the bluetooth ! TO fix this , get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end ( mole skin ) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece ( if needed ) on top of the other . This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you ! With this fix , you will still be able to close your boom .	1
Ordered from OEM and it arrived quickly , within a couple of days . I would recommend this company to others and would use it again myself.I have found all ear pieces to be somewhat uncomfortable for prolonged use . This USB earpiece works better than the blue tooth that I had -- - the reception is clear and very loud ( much better than the cell phone itself of the previous blue tooth ) on the other end , the people that I 've called said it was loud and clear .	1
This wired Motorola RAZR headset is better than a Bluetooth one for these reasons : -the mic is closer to your mouth so your voice will sound better and clearer than a Bluetooth headset where the mic is way up by your ear . I tried a wireless Bluetooth headset and my voice always sounded distant and callers could hear ambient room noise around me . They said I sounded like I was using a speakerphone . But when I use this wired headset , they say my voice is quite clear and loud.-it 's easier to just plug in this wired headset at any time than fool around with the settings for syncing with the Bluetooth when you want to by on headset.-This headset is easier to carry with you than a Bluetooth one and no AC adapater charger or battery is required.-This headset is cheaper than a Bluetooth headset and in fact comes bundled with some RAZR phones.The only reason I 'm not rating this headset 5 stars is that I agree with other reviews , the earpiece does n't fit that snuggly in the ear . This is a minor complaint for me though as the headset does pretty much what I want it to do and it does it nicely .	1
I bought this to protect from scratches , from accidental dropping and to make my pocket not heavy.. This cover has proved satisfactory in all respects : I dropped the phone a few times already and thing happened . After using the phone for 9 months , it still shines line new - not a single scratch . It is very easy to put on and off . There are 2 minor issues with this : a ) You need to take extra care when you plug on the charger , to make sure the phone charges - the leather cover comes in the way of the charger - after a few accidental `` battery dying out '' , I learned to connect it properly to get a full charge.b ) The elastic band/top cover comes in the way of the camera - so for taking pictures , I remove the top sleeve.c ) Inspite of all the positive feedback , I still feel it makes the phone bulky , but the belt clip is very tough , and I do n't mind the extra bulk to act like a cowboy .	1
Perfect slim close fitting case and is well worth the money . The razr remains very thin since this case is wellcrafted . No bulk here and extremely stylish . Krusell makes the best cell phone cases in the world .	1
Fits the Motorola Razr V3 like it was specifically designed for it . The elastic top allows you to use the flip functionality of your phone unlike other leather covers that prohibit your phone from closing all the way.Perfect .	1
It protects your phoneIt does n't really make your phone thickThe multi-adapter system really works ( although I usually leave it off ) The cover is a snap ( literally ) to install/remove and is of high qualityThe Motorola Cover is pretty bad ( see the reviews )	1
I like this phone . It feels well made and has a beautiful quality generously proportioned screen ; a definite plus for folks who like games on their cells . Although the Amazon listing calls it a Tri-band phone , it is in fact Quad-band . Most importantly for me , it speaks Mac . Using a data cable ( pick up a cheapie on ebay ) it functions flawlessly with iSync for iCal and Address Book . The only thing that I 'm not very pleased about is that contact email and addresses do n't seem to transfer to the phone ( the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 ) . There might be a way to accomplish this , but I have n't been able to figure out how to do it.But what I really like about his phone is that it functions quite handsomely as a wireless bluetooth modem . My phone uses the T-Mobile network , and combined with the `` all the data you can eat `` program ( around $ 20 a month ) and my iBook with a D-Link BT adapter , and I 'm good to go . The set up is a bit complex , but the nice folks at T-Mobile supplied me with the info.It 's controls are very easy to use and it looks great , I live in a signal challenged area , but I have found that the V330 works better then any other cell I have ever owned . The photo quality is n't anything to write home about , though the zoom feature is pretty effective . Generally speaking I like my cell phones to have data card capacity , particularly for photo storage , but T-Mobile has a nifty Album feature which lets you store your pics online . I was also impressed by this little phone 's sound.The V330 is a real winner !	1
This is actually a quad-band mobile phone which makes it a true 'world phone ' ... more so than the common tri-band devices.World phones are generally equipped w/ both 1900 and 1800 frequencies . Together , these frequencies cover Europe , much of the U.S. and many other countries . Most tri-band units , however , are usually equipped with either 850 or 900mhz.850 fills in the 'rural gaps ' in The States . 900 allows for roaming in New Zealand and Australia . Whereas both T-Mobile and Cingular operate on GSM frequencies and therefore can offer world phones , Cingular operates on the 850 and T-Mobile on 900 . They allow each other to use their frequencies for instances where they do n't provide a needed frequency ... provided you device is equipped w/ both 850 & 900 mhz as is the Motorola V330.How is T-Mobile ? Truth of the matter ( as with any mobile phone service ) it comes down to the region you live in as well as what building your in and the area that building is in . Sorry , there is no across-the-board answer . As soon as one gets great reception , his/her neighbor curses it.Visually , this phone is indistinguishable from just another flip phone , but it offers rather large and well-spaced keys . The screen is vivid and bright . The ringtone gets plenty loud . For these reasons , it 's a great phone for seniors who still want a modern phone . I just got one for my mum.Of course , being a quad-band , video , camera , multi-zoom , bluetooth , infrared device w/ browser , the general ease of operation can only be so easy . That 'said , ' many a senior probably could n't be bothered w/ messing with it all or putting to test call quality in rural U.S. and New Zealand.That you get all of this and at such a price makes the V330 an eyebrow-raising steal.One more thing - That it 's blue , not the de riguer black or silver , I like.A quality phone packed w/ a host of goodies . Go 'head on , Motorola .	1
This is one of the nicest phones I have used . It is a traditional flip phone for those who use their phone as a phone and works very well .	1
This is a very nice phone . Much nicer than my Razr V3 that I returned 3 times because of the high pitched whining noise ... if you can live with high pitched static when answering calls ( yes , this only happens when answering ... NOT when making an outside call ) . I like the color ( and toying with changing the face plates ) and the functionality with great battery life . Its camera is pretty descent as far as cell phones go . It is clear and works . It is not super fancy , though it has a lot of fuctionality . I am a bit disappointed that T-Mobile and Motorola do n't have more choices right now , as I would have been happy to buy them . Anyway , if you want a good phone with Bluetooth ( BT ) , then this is a very good one .	1
I 've been using this phone for about three weeks on the T-Mobile system within CT and while travelling . It has been an easy to operate phone . There are a few minor flaws that I 've found which you may want to consider prior to making a purchase decision.PROS-Solid reception - seems to hold calls pretty well - have not experienced unexpected call drops.-As near as I can tell people are hearing my calls clearly-Easy to text message with predictive entry - very clear interface and helpful completion of words-While on T-Mobile you can be browsing the web and also receive an incoming voice call ( though you can not continue to browse - the key is that it does n't send people to your Voicemail ) . I believe this is a function of the GSM technology that T-Mobile and Cingular operate under.CONS-Earpiece volume is low - you 'll have difficulty using this in noisy environments.-Not EDGE ( high speed Internet ) capable-If there is a way to have multiple contact info ( home , business , cell , email ) for one address book entry - I have n't found it . Instead I have awkwardly had to setup multiple address entries ( how 1980 's ) .-The phone offers a Bluetooth connection - and there should be a standard keypress to turn the BT on and off . Instead you have to create a shortcut or re-map one of the `` smart '' keys to do the task.-It should be easier to change ring styles - most phones allow you to change the style to vibrate right from the volume buttons or a key press - the V330 supports this ( kinda ) but you have to use the up/down volume and then a smart key to select . The extra steps are tedious when you are trying to go into a store or movie theater and want to mute the phone.SUMMARYI 'd purchase this phone again for T-Mobile . I considered other phones before making this purchase and the overall features ( including the ability to use Bluetooth ) are what attracted me to the V330.The requirement to list multiple names in the phone book is really odd and it might be that I just have n't found the `` secret '' . The phone does n't come with any type of detailed user manual so you have to go online and look at a PDF to get the information . So far I have not uncovered any secret . If I had a large phone book that I wanted to use , then I 'd probably have passed on this phone ( and any other Motorola using a similar scheme ) .If you are frequently in noisy environments , this probably is not the phone for you either . The earpiece is just too low . I 'm constantly trying to raise the volume when talking to someone out in a crowded place that has noise.For a good middle-of-the road phone with solid reception , I do n't think you can go too wrong with the V330 .	1
I have owned a Treo 650 on and off and on again since this model came out . Initially , I was extremely frustrated by the phone 's telephone performance and its lack of stability . Frequent reboots , freezes and dropped calls made it difficult to appreciate the phone . I ended up getting rid of it and relying on a separate palm and cell phone . Over time , PalmOne has released firmware updates ( the phone 's operating system ) that have made the phone very stable . The improvements we so significant that they actually won me back . This review is for the GSM Treo 650.A word about Carriers : I only use GSM because I travel abroad frequently - this limits me to Cingular and Tmobile . I have used both , and I have found that Cingular 's network coverage is more complete , especially in rural areas , but Tmobile 's network sounds better . It 's a tradeoff - with Tmobile , you 'll drop the call more often , but with Cingular you 'll say `` what ? '' more often . Their coverage is about equal in big cities and along major highways . International roaming is less expensive with Tmobile , plus Cingular has a few hurdles in place that prevent you from enabling international roaming on your account if you 've been with them for less than 6 months . Verizon and Sprint use a cellular technology that is US-only , and therefore no good for using your phone abroad.Here are the phone 's pros : in your pocket , you have your address book , datebook , notes , e-mail , low-res still and video camera , a very nice sms interface that threads sms exchanges by contact , a web browser , and an mp3 player . The QWERTY keyboard makes typing much faster than a standard phone . The interface is unique and you will need a little time to get used to it , but once you do you will be as efficient at quick-dialing and keeping up with daily use as on any other phone . Also , this phone is a quad-band GSM which means that it will work very well abroad , unlike the more common tri-band GSM phones , which do n't perform as well . ( Remember , if you get a Treo Smartphone from Verizon or Sprint , it will not work abroad . ) The screen on the Palm version is brilliant . The Windows version is not as sharp - a limitation imposed by the operating system . Also , GSM technology uses `` SIM '' cards , which means you can simply change out the `` SIM '' and use your phone on another network or another phone number , either domestically or while abroad . ( You might have a phone locked onto a carrier 's network until your contract commitment is complete , but that 's something you can sort out on your own ) .Here are the phone 's cons : I said `` in your pocket '' because if you mount this thing on your belt , the bulge may force you to make alterations on your sport jacket . Also , in an age of identity theft and information security , you should think long and hard about just how much information is in there . Believe me , the phone quickly becomes a place to store passwords , account information , customer information , etc . Consider how you will feel if you leave it in a restaurant , or if it 's stolen.Here are lesser cons that can be worked around : The beauty of these palm phones is that they 're so popular ; other people have had whatever problem you might encounter , and they 've written software to address / fix / work around the issue . For example , I found that the phone 's volume is not loud enough . There is 3rd party volume software to fix that , as well as software that allows you to use the phone as a Bluetooth modem for your computer . Some software is freeware , some is shareware , and some is for purchase . The key is that there are so many forums and resources on the Internet that you can search around and find the answers that you need , and the phone allows you to install and uninstall with as much ease as with your home PC.Thoughts about newer Treo phones : The 650 now costs a little less because the Treo 700w and 700p have come out . This is a good thing , because I do n't see the 700 having any new features that make the upgrade a `` must '' . Other than a slightly redesigned appearance and interface , and higher resolution camera , the phone 's features are basically identical . Also , as of the Summer 2006 , the Treo 700 is only available on CDMA networks . The Treo folks have staggered the release of GSM and CDMA models to give the all carriers a turn at exclusivity.Looking to the future , there is speculation that the next generation Treo phone will be a GSM , it will be thinner , lighter , and the antenna will be internal - basically , it will more resemble a blackberry on the outside . These are much sought after features by Treo users . Maybe I 'll upgrade then.In conclusion , only 4 stars for this phone because the product was n't ready for market when they released it . It 's much better now ; if they had initially released the current product , I would have given it 5 stars . I hope my perspective helps you with your decision.UPDATE - Jan 08 , 2007 : the Treo750 ( windows mobile ) has come out in the UK with Vodafone , and here in the USA , the Treo680 ( Palm OS ) has been announced with Cingular . In forums on the internet , people have reported that the new 680 addresses many wish-list items for the Treo faithful : slighly thinner ( a modest few millimeters ) , internal antenna , better keyboard , volume-too-low issue `` sort of '' resolved , better mp3 player ( pTunes instead of Real ) , more memory , improved phone interface , EDGE instead of GPRS to double the data speed . Unfortunately , the camera has the same resolution ( 640x480 ) and the few millimeters thinner have meant a thinner battery . Treo 680 owners complain of poor battery life ( 1 day or significantly less for power users ) .As of Thanksgiving , every vendor pre-selling the Treo 680 was sold out ( including Amazon ) . This tells me two things : many Treo users are looking to upgrade immediately by choice , not out of necessity . As a result , the market should be flooded with inexpensive used Treo650s , and no doubt merchants with 650 inventory will probably sell them inexpensively enough for people who have been priced out of the smartphone market to get their hands on one.Palm says the 680 is targeted to the every day person , not the power user . I suppose that means in a year we should expect another more expensive model that will be what the 680 should have been . I feel that Palm is releasing new models in a very slow and calculated manner in order to drive consumer spending.My recommendation : if you want a Treo , go with the 650 . With an extended battery a power user ( bluetooth , e-mail , etc . ) can go 2 days between charges or 3 days with normal usage . Look for it online.The smartphone market has become very crowded with the slim Motorola Q ( windows ) , the comparably sized and feature-rich Nokia E61 ( legendary stability of Symbian OS ) , friendlier and proven Blackberry models , the Samsung blackjack ( windows ) , and lately the MDA ( windows ) is getting rave reviews with all the features you wish you could have , including Wi-Fi.The Treo does a lot - it probably has the best SMS interface on the market , but the rest is just ok. For example , the mp3 player works , but not as good as a dedicated mp3 player like an iRiver or iPod . The e-mail application works , but the IMAP implementation is poor , and POP3 performance is inconsistent re : leaving or deleting messages from the server . If you want a good e-mail application on the Treo , you 'll have to buy a 3rd party program that will be almost as good as the blackberry . But you will have to buy this app , and the more 3rd party apps you load , the less stable the device . What I 'm saying is the Treo is a jack of many trades but it 's a master of none ( except SMS/MMS messaging . ) While I am a Palm faithful , I 'm afraid that if you want a *stable* phone , e-mail , address book and schedule , the blackberry is the way to go , but you wo n't have the bells and whistles ( camera , mp3 player , 3rd party apps and touch screen ) that come with a Treo . Yes , that means I now have a crackberry . It was a Xmas gift from a friend who was tired of hearing me complain about my Treo . Here is the bottom line : if you 're getting this device as a business tool where missed calls or e-mails translate to lost money , get a blackberry . If you want a really cool phone with all the bells and whistles you can fathom and you like loading 3rd party applications and you like having a fun device to play with , then you will absolutely love the Treo .	1
I have been itching for a Treo ever since the 600 came out and I noticed that more streamlined design . When smartphones were first introduced , I bucked the trend of combining the two thinking that as often as I use my cell phone and my pda , if I bought one that integrated both I would wear it out twice as fast . And in my humble opinion , it was a valid reason because back then , the original phone/pda 's were impossibly large . Well I have finally become a convert.I spent a great deal of time researching Blackberry 's vs. the Treo 's vs. Pocket PC 's and came VERY close to grabbing a T-Mobile Dash ( which I still believe is the all-around smallest model availabe as I write this , or at least it SEEMED to be ) , but I finally settled with the trusted Palm OS platform ( one that I have become VERY familiar with over the years using pda 's for quite some time now ) . When I set out to get one , I really had my heart set on the Treo 680 ... but as I read the reviews for them , one thing kept creeping in to almost all the reviews : battery life was terrible . With that aside , quite a few of the reviewers mentioned that all things considered , they were more happy with their old 650 . I saw this on so MANY reviews that I began to think twice . Then I noticed that the 700p was a more beefed up version of the 650 , and began to consider it as well . Unfortunately as I write this , it is n't available with Alltell service where I am ( it will , but nobody can give me a target date , and dang it , I am too impatient to wait ... ) so I am right back with the 650 . It took a while before Palm was able to knock enough of the bugs out of the 650 that I felt like buying one would be worth it ... and I am discovering more than a few bugs have been associated with both the 680 & 700p , so no matter HOW much time I spend considering upgrading to a newer model , I find compelling reasons to go right back to the Old School 650.Reason # 1 to go with it : Since it is no longer available at Palm 's Official website , and with the newer models coming out , chances are you can find some pretty sweet deals on the older 650.Reason # 2 : Virtually ALL of the problems originally associated with the 650 have been eliminated . You want Push email ? You can get it . You want web surfing ? No prob . You want to view AND edit MS Word Documents and Excell ? Easier than ever with the 650 ( that was one major plus over most of the Pocket PC 's and ALL of the Blackberrys -- sure you can VIEW some of these documents , but you can not EDIT them , too ) .Reason # 3 : No matter HOW convenient the pda , I found it next to impossible to give up a touch-screen 's amazing versatility and the ease with which you can use it to edit things and connect on websites.One more important item to factor in when considering buying a 650 : With the popularity with ever increasing wireless downloading speeds , I was afraid that the slower Treo would make internet surfing next to impossible because of the archaic speeds with which you are forced to endure . I was VERY pleastantly surprised that downloading web pages did not take as long as I was at first expecting . I have to tell you , after experimenting with the supposedly MUCH faster 700p with another online carrier than the one I was using ( I wo n't say which , but they really did their best to tell me the 650 was slower than a dial-up modem from 1985 ) , anyway , the 650 was only SLIGHTLY slower than this screaming fast 700p or the 700w . I figured that was something I could live with to be honest . Hey , it 's a tiny hand-held device that allows me to send and receive email and surf the web ... I 'm still amazed that something like this exists at ALL to be honest with you ... so downloading speed is still secondary in my opinion . If speed really IS on your list of absolutes , maybe you ought to move up to something else ... but keep in mind , it is only BARELY faster than what I experienced first hand.One more thing : the screen is amazing . There are only so many ways to say WOW . If you are considering buying a Palm that runs Windows Mobile , you ought to know that the screen clarity is almost reduced by HALF . This apparently has something to do with Window 's OS , and seriously put my decision to buy one on the back burner.Sure there are things that a smartphone can not as yet do without some difficulty or impossibility ... but that is the same with ALL current models . Do some SERIOUS research into what you want vs. what you NEED and make an informed decision only AFTER you have had the chance to go into a store and test a specific model PERSONALLY . Do that and no matter WHAT you decide on , you will most likely be happy . So far , I know I am VERY satisfied with my choice . Good luck on yours . ***UPDATE***I opted not to get a Bluetooth hands-free device -- at first . Originally I would see people walking around with these Lt. Uhura type thingy 's sticking out of their ears and I could n't help but wonder how lazy people are that they can not raise their hand up to their head while walking around simply to talk on the phone . For the most part I STILL feel this way , but I decided to buy a Bluetooth hands-free headset for while I am driving . I can not afford to miss calls , and being in radio , when not at work or home I can be found in my car monitoring the radio virtually 100 % of the time and unfortunately this means I sometimes can not hear the ringer . The tethered device that came with the phone is certainly loud enough , but simply did not fit my ear ( it kept falling out ) . I bought a replacement that came with a variable size adapter and yet while it FIT better , the sound was almost impossible to hear ( the worst I have ever experienced , actually ) . So I took the plunge knowing full-well that the Palm Treo has a somewhat problematic history using these devices ... so I made sure that I had an iron-clad return policy in place and jumped in . It took me no more than a minute to configure my head-set and I went ahead and made a test call which had more than enough volume -- in fact it had plenty to spare . All in all I am VERY satisfied with the performance . ( I bought a Keycera Bluetooth , if that means anything ) One additional item that requires mentioning : I currently have call-waiting as a service with my Treo and yet I have missed at least 3 calls ( that I know of ) . This particular feature does not seem to be supported by the 650 ... and IF it is , I have yet to discover any useful info regarding the problem , whether online or in the bible-sized instruction manual . I will keep looking and IF I find a solution I will quickly report it here asap . Just one more thing to think about . Otherwise , I am amazingly satisfied with my Treo otherwise . The ONLY thing I wish ( other than user-friendly call-waiting ) is faster downloads while online . That is supposedly possible with the newer models using EVDO and yet the 700p I tested failed to work only slightly faster than my 650 . Maybe it was the network -- but not according to them ( no surprise there ) . I still think my purchase was WELL worth it .	1
It 's been two weeks with my Treo 650 and now I remember why I love the Palm OS so much . I switched to BlackBerry two years ago ( 7290 ) and I 've enjoyed using it except for the very , very basic screen . I assume that 's how they get such remarkable battery life . But , I 've had to switch from the BB for work reasons and I 'm very happily using Palm again . My last Palm was a Palm Vx and it 's still alive and kicking after many , many years.The Treo 650 's screen is really amazing . And , I 've read the older reviews about the Treo 650 and the frequent resetting issue . I was certainly concerned and ready to send it back if I had problems ( Cingular gives you 30 days to try it out ) . So far only one reset in two weeks with the Palm - honestly , I had to reset the BlackBerry constantly so I 'm not sure I 'd notice the difference . And , the BB resets are particularly annoying because they would happen at the start of answering incoming calls and then literally take 5-8 minutes to reset and let me use it again . I 'm not sure why it took so long - I did have a big address book . The Palm reset only took 30 seconds.But , here 's where Treo shines : screen graphics , photos , mp3s and videos . I can put 2-4 movies on a 2GB SD card , pop into the Palm and carry around some convenient entertainment . One little feature that really impressed me was the ability to display the screen vertically ( it 's longer that way ) . With letterbox movies it really increases the size of the video and exceeds the size of videos on my Zen Vision 30GB screen . And , the videos really look incredible.And , of course , there 's a ton of free software out there for the Palm . So far , I 've only downloaded TCPMP for the movies . The included RealPlayer is very impressive - you 're ready to listen to mp3s right out of the box.Final note : I 've used the Palm Desktop for PIM stuff ( contacts , calendar , to do 's ) off and on for years and I 'm still impressed with it 's features and easy/quick navigation . They 've always been ahead of the pack - I know many of the newer phones come with similar PIM software so your PC can talk to your new phone but aside from BlackBerry no one else is even in the ballpark.You can manage photos in there as well and even add photos to your address book so once you 've synced up your incoming calls display a picture of the caller . I know this has been around for a while but it was n't available on my old Palm V or the new BlackBerry I 've been using for the past few years .	1
I 've only been using mine a couple of weeks , but have been using both Palmpilots and cell phones for years -- and should mention that I lived in Japan for seven years , where the functions of the Treo would be considered very basic and even far outdated with the notable exception that you can add software and therefore functionality to the Treo.Despite what I would consider the low resolution of the camera and screen , the slow speed performance over the wireless network ( apparrently the later models of Treo are broadband speed now ) , and the fact that Palm Software basically came out with a set of winners back in the 1990s and never improved notably , do n't let the critical attitude I write this review in deceive you . I love this thing . It 's perfect for me and my needs -- personally , as well as in business.-New batteries and accessories are and will be available for years following your purchase , which means this has it all over other cell phones.-When you upgrade , all your data is transferrable even if you completely change carriers.-One program I added for instance is basically Google Earth -- in my pocket ! And with memory cards in the gigabytes , I can add any and as much functionality as I care to have -- plus store all my rediculous photos and other nonsense without worrying about running out of space.-I 'll be using this as my mp3 player , and it 's a camera that will be there even when I would n't have thought to bring one.-It holds all my appointments , vital information , etc . . . .-It has advantages over the super Japanese cell phones and system in that I can take longer movies and send them by regular e-mail.-When negotiating business over lunch or golf , where it would be a weak hand to bring a stack of papers or notes , you can input and look up information as need be in this device you would be expected to carry instead.-Add that I can basically use as many e-mail accounts on it as I like.This basically negates whatever need I had to carry a laptop unless I 'm on an extended business trip.This is truly a computer with internet access in my pocket . It can do all the same basic stuff a desktop computer can do.I 'm only taking one star away because there are now later models even more capable , and if you 're considering buying the 650 you might as well get it with faster internet access.Note that friends of mine with the 700w as opposed to the 700p say they miss the Palm native software and some have said they 'll switch to the 700p to get it -- so it 's something to consider if you 're thinking of going a step above the 650.Lastly , though I do find this increadibly handy , I do n't know that it 's worth the asking price that 's usually listed . If a cell phone of any kind is connected to a service , the most it should cost the customer is $ 200 with a service contract . There 's really no excuse for charging people $ 500 for any phone ( and I would n't have bought mine if it did n't cost me exactly $ 75 used ) . They 're selling you a service and making you sign a contract that they 'll charge you big time for breaking , so they should take the additional expense when it comes to equiptment for for accessing services they 're going to charge you or your company through the nose for anyway.Cingular is currently selling these for $ 45 with a service contract , and I would take that deal if I were n't able to get mine for a reasonable price . Conversely , I 'd rather not have one issued by my company because that would leave me not a moment 's privacy ( people I have important business with know when it 's appropriate to reach me by means other than my office phone or e-mail , and when it 's not . )	1
As someone who used the original Palm Pilot and eventually the Handspring Visor with Visor phone , I thought off and on about buying the Treo 650 . The very mixed , sometimes extreme , reviews of the 650 and the relatively high price for an unlocked Treo kept me away . With the release of the next generation of Treos drmatically forcing down the price of the 650 I decided to take a chance . After a week of fairly active use I have to say that I am extremely pleased with my new Treo . I bought my new unlocked ( Cingular branded ) Treo online . The phone clarity is as good as any mobile phone that I have owned . I have not had any dropped calls . The browswer and e-mail client that came loaded on my Treo work well . I live in a country where the fastest mobile data connection is still GPRS/EDGE , so my Tro 650 is just right . I easily synced my Treo with my MacBook with no problems . Over all for $ 225 + shipping and handling of $ 20 I have to say that this was a real bargain .	1
I am in love with this phone ! First off , the Palm functionality is wonderful ! The address book and calendar all work excellently , and the cross-functions are greatImprovements include SMS messaging , which is much faster and now includes hyperlinks for phone numbers and web addresses , unlike the Treo 600The web on here is faster -- -- the screen is crisperHowever , BlueTooth is the BEST new feature -- -- - wireless data transfer is , usually , quick , and the wireless headphones are greatLastly - many have complained that the phone is too slow with its functions and unstable -- - however , ever since the system software was updated to 1.12 , it has made the phone much quicker and much more stable ! Ordering a new phone today should come with that 1.12 software built into it , alreadyI am a former Treo 300 and 600 user , and the 650 is a wonderful upgrade and worth every penny , considering the bluetooth and software improvementsalso - if you 're going GSM , then the UNLOCKED model is a great idea , as this model can work on any GSM network in the world , depending on which SIM card you useso buy it ! ! ! - you wo n't be sorryPS - the Cardo Scala bluetooth earpiece is the best earpiece out there for this phone	1
They send you a whole credit card sized piece of plastic with this . It 's like when there is christmas and the kids only want to play with the box . Yeah , somehow it 's exactly like that .	1
It was so much easier to buy this off amazon than to go a store and have to deal with the sales person . Amazon you rock .	1
This is exciting stuff ... wooo hooo . I plug the new 3G SIM card in my new Blackberry Bold and yes it works . : )	1
Over the years , my household has tried multiple Bluetooth solutions for our hands-free communications needs . We 've had acceptable results from a solution integrated into GPS ... but much of our regular driving does n't include the need to load up a full-size GPS . We 've had acceptable results from a visor-mounted Bluetooth speaker unit , but let 's face it : sometimes we want to hold conversations that do n't include everybody in the car : - ) The Plantronics Voyager 510 has proven its value overs more than three years of demanding use . It fits comfortably over your ear excellent incoming and outgoing audio clarity . Best of all is its outstanding ability to hold a charge for a long time . I can generally count on more than a week between charges , even during periods of heavy use.We liked this enough to buy three ... one for each driver in the house .	1
Usually I do n't have time to write reviews but this time I decided to do it simply to help others like me who tried many different headsets by Motorola and thought that probably there is nothing good on the market yet . I received this one as a gift from my friend and love it for two simple reasons:1 ) The sound quality is excellent . Despite the fact that it is very noisy in my car when I drive on the highway , I still can hear excellent . I actually do reduce volume on the headset because it has more volume potential than I need . I tried two headsets by Motorola in the past , including HS850 . They also have volume button but even when you set to the maximum volume you ca n't hear well if you in a noisy environment . Plantronics provide you great quality and enough volume for any noisy environment . Also , everyone whom I talked to , told me that they can hear me very well , just like I speak without the headset.2 ) Reason number two - it sits perfectly on the ear . It is easy to insert it when you drive , and once it in , it stays there . It does n't move at all . Unlike Motorola headset , that does not fall off but it moves on your ear and it takes a long time to get used to the fact that it is not falling off your ear . Plantronics also provides three different sizes of the pieces that you insert to your ear , makes it perfect to fit any size or shape.That is all I have to say . There is a good headset out there . You do n't need to wait any more .	1
No complaints from this headset . It 's comfortable in the ear , has a mute function and works flawlessly with my PS3 and KRAZR !	1
We have tried everything from the moto-850 to the other plantronics and after seeing this in a gold box deal thought what the heck . To my amazement it has been really a fantastic headset . Easy to pair , easy to adjust volume , great battery life , very clear even with wind noise and city sounds around , and last but not least it has an indicator light that does not look like an emergency strobe ( I hated my mot-850 for that at night it would reflect off the glass and the dash in the car or the side window and drive you insane ... ) All and all a 5 star unit	1
I have a Samsung D807.It 's a piece of cake to set up . It 's very comfortable . I think it looks cooler than those other ones that look humongous in your ear . So far , no one is able to tell when I 'm using it or when I 'm talking into the phone.My wife and I have the same phone/headsets , and we 've used them together without any interference .	1
Great sound quality in the car . People hear me OK even with the music in the car ( not blasting ) , and when the windows are slightly open.It 's a little larger the i expected but comfortable even over glasses . ( yes do n't forget that your glasses will interfere with most over-the-ear setups.Power button is hard to press , because it does n't go in , it kinda shifts to the side and you do not get a nice click response ( audio or otherwise ) .	1
I have owned several Bluetooth cell phone headsets , and the PLT 510 is the best so far . It fits my ear perfectly , I can wear it for hours without noticing it , and it gives great sound . I had no problem syncing it to my iPhone , and although I have n't tried any other devices , I anticipate no problems.I only have two complaints:1 . The on-off switch is very small and hard to use . I find that I have to push it with my thumbnail to make it work . If you have smaller fingers , you may have less of a problem.2 . Plantronics uses a proprietary connector for charging , while other manufacturers are switching to mini or micro USB . A proprietary charging interface means one more wire to carry with me.In summary , a great purchase .	1
This is a very good bluetooth headset , however I recently purchased a newer Plantronics as the sound quality and smartphone compatibility has changed since I bought this one . I still use this with one of my cellphones and it has lasted over 3 years now .	1
After using a low-end JABRA bluetooth for the past year , this Plantronics voyager is so welcome ! It paired easily with my phone and with the different ear cushions , you can have one custom for your ear canal.While I found it to fit easily onto my ear and hold well , my boyfriend who has his ears more flat against his head had a hard time hooking it on his ear and having it stay there without much adjustment needed . Also , he said that it was too bulky for his liking , but I like it just fine ! The sound quality is great , I can hear others well and I 'm told that I come through very clearly . I have had it for almost 2 months and only had to charge it once besides that first time and I use it everyday for 1-2 hours each time - that 's good battery life !	1
This works well and is comfortable , vs the couple of MOT headsets I bought , which were horible . The volume level is good for me , and I have hearing loss , so that 's impressive as well . The contols are easy to use . I 'm using this with an older MOT V330 . Highly recommended for both the performance and price . Oh , contrary to another reviewers suggestion , it will not fit into a mint tin due to it 's width . I have n't found a good hard-case solution for it yet.Update on 8/16/08 : I thought I lost my 510 , so after reviewing all the newer units , I bought another one ! The newer models appear to be riddled with minor bugs & issues , so why not stick with a winner ? I 'm now using this with my T-Mobile Dash and it works great for the voice command features . My office was trying to decide on which model to go with , so we ordered up a half a dozen latest models of headsets . I added my own to the evaluation pool . After two weeks of testing , almost everyone liked the 510 better than all the rest , so we ordered up 20 of them ! If this model was discontinued and I needed a new headset , I 'd go with the latest `` jawbone '' ; which worked fine , had better wind resistance , but did n't have quite the all-day comfort or inherent design durability of the 510 . Hope this helps !	1
I really love this product . It is easy to use and very comfortable on ear . I forget that I have it on after sometime.The quality of sound is very good , I can clearly hear the person I am talking to . And it seems that they can hear me as well.But what I like the most is the price . Very affordable for the quality . So I am very satisfied with my headset.Thank you !	1
I have owned this 510 for almost four years and have worn it nearly eight hours every day . I have been very satisfied . The cons for this ear piece are it does not block wind and background noise very well . My ear buds are getting very loose after four years , so I am ordering another set of those . I also ordered a new pro plus headset after watching the product demo in the wind tunnel . Very convincing . I will rate the new headset after I try it out . At any rate , you ca n't go wrong with the 510 .	1
I 've only had this unit for about 24 hours , but I really like it . These are my initial impressions , and I compare this to the Motorola H680 as overall about equal , very similar to the findings by a major consumer-oriented organization as to these two Bluetooths.I gave my used H680 away to a friend of mine because she was driving me crazy always speaking to me over her speaker phone while driving . She used the speaker phone out of necessity because in California you can not put the phone to your ear while driving , and her bluetooth 's battery had died . My friend is not mechanically adept and I would 've kept the H680 otherwise . It is smaller and more convenient to use than this Plantronics , but I feel the sound quality with this unit is better . This unit takes some adjustment so I hope the following comments will be of benefit to those of you who purchase this unit:1 . Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.2 . Thoroughly read the instruction booklet.3 . Once you have thoroughly read the instruction booklet ( it 's not lengthy ) and you get past setting it for your left ear ( if that is your desire ) , the only major thing to do is to determine which of the three eartips is best for you . This is important for comfort and I suggest that you start with the smallest tip and work your way up . I am using the smallest tip-it works best for me.Though the unit appears to be somewhat awkward looking , it really is not uncomfortable on the ear if you accustom yourself to placing the eartip comfortably in your ear first ( contrary to the booklet and as if the unit did not contain the curved attachment ) -the rest will follow.Sound is crisper than with the H680 , and appears louder.You ca n't go wrong with either , but I think I like this one more.Update : 1/7/10 Sound is definitely better with this unit , and it appears to hold charge longer than H680 . Voyager is definitely larger than H680 . When you get past that , and realize the benefits of sound quality and longer use on a charge , you might favor , as I do , the Voyager 510 . It 's quite enjoyable not to have to repeat myself when transmitting - no one on receiving end has complained about poor sound quality !	1
After going through more headsets that I care to recall , I have finally found one that not only works reliably , but also is comfortable , inexpensive , and offers superior performance.Pairing is a little tricky - be sure to save the little instruction card , as the combination of buttons is not intuitive , IMO.The battery life is excellent in both standby and talk mode - I am constantly amazed at how long this thing can sit in my car 's center console unused and still be ready to go for a long conversation once paired . By the way , pairing with the iPhone is flawless - it seamlessly pairs and unpairs , switching easily even between paired headsets ( or in my case a Jabra speakerphone and this headset ) .The only reason I have not given in 5 stars is the * # $ & ^ proprietary charging connector . WHY , oh WHY do companies insist on reinventing the wheel constantly ? ? ? PLEASE JUST LET ME USE ONE OF THE BAZILLION mini-USB ADAPTERS I ALREADY HAVE ! ! ! Value : 5 starsPerformance : 5 starsReliability : 5 starsComfort/fit : 4 starsDesign : 2 stars ( only because of the charging adapter ! )	1
The Voyager 510 is my first experience with a Bluetooth headset . Been using it the last couple of months ; ever since California instituted its `` Hands-Free '' law on July 1 , 2008.Has been working pretty well overall . Fits reasonably well to my ears . Can be fitted on either ear with the swivel action.A minor complaint would be that the sound quality could be a little better . But not bad though.Hard to go wrong with this choice .	1
I purchased this headset about a year ago and have been very pleased with it . It pairs up well and has a good amount of range before it unpairs - oftentimes much further than the 30ft advertised.It does not offer the noise reduction I expected ( hence the 4 stars ) . Otherwise it is great.I have not tried the voice dialing , but everything I have done works well .	1
Outstanding quality . This is the second Plantronics headset I 've owned . All of them have been wonderful . The little foam boots they sell to reduce wind noise do n't work . I wear mine everyday and almost all day . Very comfortable and light weight .	1
Had a motorola and did n't care much for it . My plantronics is a better fit and more comfortable . It is a little bulky compared to motorola . So far happy with it . Works decent in noisy conditions but the ear piece is much more clear and loud compared to the motorola .	1
I got this because I used Plantronics headsets at work and love the quality + the price was awesome . This solves the main purpose of the bluetooth - to enable handsfree conversation with quality audio . The voice quality is very good - people hear me very clearly and I too hear them clearly ( at times , the volume seems to be a bit low but I do not know if it is because the other side is not speaking close into the phone or it is a problem with this ) . Pairing with the iPhone was a breeze . You can pair with 2 devices at the same time ( I tried 2 phones , but I would like to add a phone and my laptop so I can take softphone calls on my laptop without an extended headset ) .I noticed that it disconnects from the phone after some time ( less than an hour ) of non-use . The first few days , I was always powering it off and on to re-establish the connection or going to the phone settings to reconnect and I was going to return it ; however , one day I wanted to try pressing and holding the talk button for 2 seconds and bingo - it reconnects . So I do n't have to power it off/on to reconnect.I am not sure if this is a feature of the iPhone or this device but I love the Voice Control - I press the talk button for 2 seconds to activate the Voice Control on my iPhone and I can say the number or name I want to dial and it dials for me . So now I am 100 % hands-free while driving I use voice control all the time to dial people.I gave a 4 rating because this is not as comfortable as the Motorola H720 that I got for my wife ( H720 is true over the ear headset - nothing going into your ear - you can read my review for that product on Amazon ) . Getting on the ear is a bit difficult - need 2 hands usually.For folks that want to listen to music from your iPhone/BBerry , please note that this headset is NOT A2DP enabled . i.e . you can not stream music to your headset from your smartphone . If that is important for you , you can try Jabra BT8040 ( I owned 8010 until I lost it , and I liked that - Plantronics or Motorola H720 voice quality was better than my old 8010 though ) .	1
The last Bluetooth headset I used was a Motorola something-or-the-other , and frankly I was underwhelmed . A few years later , I tried thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [ Retail Packaging ] , and it was amazing . For the most part , people ca n't tell that I 'm on a Bluetooth headset ! The Pros : Great audio quality ! Good battery life.The cons : I only wish it had a better earpiece ... on that really goes INTO my ears , like mySony MDR-XB20EX 9mm High Sensitivity Driver Extra Bass EX Earbuds . The volume and mute buttons are kinda small and hard to reach/press.Those are just small details though . Overall I am impressed .	1
This unit replaced a Motorola HS850 conscripted by my wife : - ) It 's better than the HS850 in the following ways:1 ) People hear me better . Mic is really good.2 ) When the unit fits properly , audio amplification is betterIt 's worse than the HS850 in that:1 ) it does n't fit as well . I find myself readjusting it throughout the day2 ) It does n't synchronize instantaneously with my MPX220 like the HS850 did . It always syncs eventually ( 15-60 seconds ) .Battery life is a tie . Both are OK , but not as long as I would like ( I 've had to recharge mid-day a few times . 1-1.5 hours of talk appears to be the limit ) .	1
This is my 3rd bluetooth . Works very well , my others had lots of static and noise , this has minimal noise . also fits very well to my ear.Only thing I do n't like , when I 'm outside , for some reason the wind interfears with my reception , I ca n't hear the person I 'm talking too , and they ca n't hear me . Works great indoors though . Would recommend .	1
I 've tried the Motorola ones and either I could n't hear or the person on the other end could n't hear ( usually both ) . I bought this based on a recommendation of a Realtor that swore by it , and to be honest , I have only had occasional trouble with it . It 's comfortable to wear , it 's easy to hear , the other person hears me . I wear it most of the day , on project sites , while driving , even at home . It works as expected and I 'm very pleased with the results . If you need a bluetooth , this is the one .	1
Definitely a good buy , especially as the price keeps dropping ! Excellent sound . I have it paired with a Razr , and it was fairly straightforward , after I carefully re-read and understood the instructions : - ) I wish they had made it easier to fold and put in a pocket ( and also that it shut off easily like some of the Moto models ) . Also note that if you use the little foam tip for the mouthpiece , it can fall off way too easily .	1
I have tested many bluetooth headsets . This one sets the bar pretty high . The battery life is wonderful usually outlasting a phone charge by a factor of two . It is generally compatible with just about all the regular phones . If you have a Palm OS phone , pick a different headset as this MAY work , but has some issues that I find are difficult to live with.The good : This is a very durable headset ( mine went through the washer and dryer and still works after it dried out for a few days ) . The multiple options for ear pieces , flexibility of the design ( switching ears without carrying extra accessories ) , compatibility with lots of phones , antenna design solving cross body communications for some phones , charging options with USB and power ( you can wear it while charging comfortably ) , and battery life all are great . It connects to 2 devices at a time though you can obviously only answer one of them at a time.The Bad : ( all minor ) The wind smart does not work that great . I have yet to find a bluetooth headset that can handle direct wind noise and this is no exception . It does better than most but remote parties still complain . Every headset I have tested fails here . This is difficult to distinguish between mute on the headset and power off . I tuned it off a few times on accident when trying to mute . Oops . The mute also does not alert you frequently enough that it is on , but you can still mute from the phone separately without issues . Pairing is simple , but not just a one button option.I would suggest this headset to users looking for a good headset for most devices . Consider other options with Palm OS phones .	1
Great wind noise reducing headset . Works well in any condition . Light weight even though it appears to be bigger than some units . Most comfortable fitting headset I 've ever used . If I had one negative thing to say it would be that sometimes people tell me that I need to speak up while using the device but that is very rare and could possibly have to do with me and not the device itself .	1
It 's big , and bulky . Works okay . Bought a Sony that works great , and is small .	1
Many good things have been written about this product and I agree with most . I would like to comment on the things I did n't see a lot of before I purchased.1 . Talk time : I 'm on the phone 3000 to 5000 minutes per month as a Director of Business Development . About 6 hours per day talk time is all you get . Not good , not bad , pretty much on par with the other 3 BT Headsets I 've owned . I will say that it seems this unit charges more quickly than the other I 've owned.2 . I wear Glasses : It fits Ok with them . The only problem comes when you remove your glasses with the Headset on ; the Headset is prone to fly off . I can tell you that the unit is durable after several such flights.3 . Comfort : I 'm a `` big guy , '' 285 lbs . Comfort did n't come quickly for me . I still need to change ears a couple of times a day . However , after around 30 days it is much better and I expect one day I 'll not even know it is there.4 . Sound : Good most of the time . Better than the others I 've owned . Loud . If you drive the highway this one works well . Background noise is reduced but not eliminated ; and unlike another background reducing Headset I own ( from Plantronics also ) there is no delay on call pick-up ... nice ! 5 . Props to Plantronics . By pressing the volume + key as you turn the unit on , the blinking blue light gets turned off ( and on ) , this is important to me because people look like Cyborgs walking around blue blinking in public ( not professional at all ) .6 . On/Off : I thought it would be a problem after the things I read . I have big fingers . Not a problem ; maybe they enhance it some from older models.That 's it ; mostly all good except comfort which seems to be coming around .	1
I am not only please with the product but also the cost I got it at .	1
Great sound , great transmission . Lightweight , comfortable . Maybe not the easiest to get on as it curls around the ear ... or I 'm just challenged . However , once mounted , it 's pretty secure ! Linking to my LG 8300 cell phone was a breeze .	1
Bought this with the unit that converts your desk phone to a bluetooth compatible headset - best buy for the money ! I talk on the phone most of the day when in the office , and use both the desk line and my cell phone . The system allows me to use the same headset for both . Good battery life .	1
This is , by far , the BEST bluetooth headset I have ever owned . I 've tried all the Motorola ones , and they pale in comparison to the Plantronics . You can see by all the positive reviews that this thing is amazing . I can walk all over my house while my phone is in one spot , and talk without any interference . The only problem is that I always forget where I put my phone ! The range on this headset is truly amazing.The sound quality is amazing as well . No one can ever tell I 'm on a headset . And once you start using this , you 'll soon wonder how you ever lived without it . I ca n't tolerate holding a phone to my ear anymore because this headset makes life SO much easier.And I 've had mine for over two years without any problems . I accidentally forgot I left it in my sweatshirt pocket and WASHED IT , and it still works ! I could n't believe it . Sure , the battery life suffers after years of use , but they 're so cheap that it 's no problem at all to get a new one.My only complaint is that the blue light on it is extraordinarily BRIGHT . I ca n't charge this thing at night without covering it up because it 's like a blue lighthouse in my room . And when it 's on , the flashing blue light is VERY annoying in dark rooms ( e.g . watching a movie ) . That 's really my only complaint.You really can not go wrong on a bluetooth headset for such little money . Do n't even think twice ! I 've recommended this heaset to about 10 different people , who all LOVE it .	1
This little ugly-ish set is still ruling the market with great sound quality for both its owners and people they talk to . I have owned or tested several supposedly great Bluetooth sets with several different phones and devices including iPhone 3G , Motorola Razr and L6 , Blackberry 7100i , two different laptops ( Skype ) and Playstation 3 , and no other headset performed as well as Plantronics Voyager 510.In parallel with this device I had three different Jabras including BT250 , BT500 and JX10 and neither one comes close to the sound quality and wind tolerance of Voyager 510 . I also learned of a number of users including my boss who switched from Jawbone 1 AND 2 to this or Discovery 925 set due to fit , comfort and sound issues , so I never even bothered to buy a Jawbone . With Plantronics Voyager 510 , people I talk to ca n't even tell I 'm using a Bluetooth headset ; not even when I 'm driving , which I find amazing . Since it 's been over four years in my never ending quest for the perfect Bluetooth headset that I constantly keep researching and reverting to this little `` mule '' , I just have to give it five stars in spite of its mainly cosmetic flaws.Here 's why I got to appreciate this somewhat clumsy set so much:1 . Good output volume and quality . When I 'm using Plantronics Voyager 510 , people I 'm talking to ca n't tell I 'm on a cell phone with a Bluetooth headset - not even when I 'm driving ( windows closed ) . The case was the opposite when I was using Jabras , when I used to hear complaints about noise , static and low volume of my voice.2 . Good and controllable earphone volume . It can reasonably well deal with traffic noise when I 'm walking outside my downtown Chicago office . I can set the volume really loud , so the only case when I can not hear my partner is when I 'm walking too close to a moving train . My usual volume setting is around 1/3.3 . This set 's microphone tolerates wind better than the Jabras mentioned above which used to produce a great deal of wind noise whenever I was encountering a breeze . In addition , if I know I 'll be outside in a windy environment I can put the included microphone sponge on.4 . Good battery life . I do n't have to charge it often.5 . Although it seems very light and gentle in my hands , it handles everyday folding and switching between my shirt pocket and both my ears very well.6 . No problems with long usage , unlike Jabra BT250 , which used to irritate the skin on the back of my ear if I used it too long or too often.I never heard about Plantronics before buying this headset and I grew to appreciate it a lot more after years of usage . Only recently I discovered that Plantronics has a long history with headsets and that even the Apollo missions used their headsets on the Moon . Makes sense . `` One small set for man , one giant leap away from other BT headsets . Houston , we have no problem '' .	1
I bought one for work and used it for a year or more with no complaints , so I bought one for my wife and she uses it constantly and loves it . Highly recommended .	1
This has to be one of the best headsets out there , I have used many and this unit has to be one to beat . No issues whatsoever , great quality and easy to use..	1
Very good sounding both ways but not usable in 18 wheeler . Mic is overwhelmed by the 75 to 100db of ambient background noise . Good noise canceling in other environments.Not good outside in wind even with new mic grill .	1
It took me just a little time to get used to this headset but I do love it . I have to admit that for the price , it works really well . Sometimes , it loses connection even though the power is on and bluetooth is blinking blue light , but if you reset it , it reconnects . Sometimes , I have not heard calls come in so reliability for me has been around 95 % . I am giving it 4 stars because for the price and comfort , it works quite well . Watch out for battery drainage on the cell so if not using , make sure to power off the bluetooth Power On to Off . It is a concern not to lose it - it 's small and without wires . I left it in the Juice store but it was right there when I went back ( lucky me ) ! I highly recommend it overall !	1
This product has done alot for me . i 've used it with multiple phones and even my PS3 and it has never failed on me . great quality headset ! easy to use and to link to . dont regret buying it .	1
I have used this headset with my Nokia 6620 and with my PC , and it works great with both , switching back and forth easily by telling either the PC or the phone to connect with it . Light crackling on occasion when 802.11b is active in the area , but not terribly noticeable . Sound quality is great indoors . The great thing is the comfort ; I find that I can wear it all day long , even though it 's not the smallest or lightest headset .	1
I chose this product based on reading many reviews of Plantronics and Motorola headsets primarily on Amazon . I am very happy with my purchase . As others have said , most will never know you are on a headset . The battery lasts all day , so having a charger with me during the day has never been even remotely necessary . I 've talked 3 or 4 hours some days , and had it on all day when I 'm not talking , and have never run the battery down . I do charge it when I get home each evening . The volume is more than enough ( and I 'm a bit hard of hearing ) . It 's comfortable so I just leave it on most of the time when I 'm at work . It works equally well in either ear . It connects quickly and works great . Sometimes it seems a bit hard to get on , but other times it just slips into place . But we 're talking sometimes it takes 10 seconds of fiddling to get it over my ear just right . Usually , it just slips on . I wear glasses and I think that 's most of the issue there . Highly recommended and I would purchase this again w/o question .	1
I 've had this headset for about almost a year and it works flawlessly . It is quite comfortable to wear with right size ear bud . Only complaint I have is it 's bit too large .	1
This bluetooth headset works great and the only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because sometimes it takes a little bit to establish a connection with my cell phone . However , this rarely happens and have had this problem with other bluetooth headsets . Setup is extremely easy and have had no other problems with the device .	1
I have small ears and sometimes have to use this gadget for 8 hour conference calls . For this reason comfort and battery life are paramount . It stays pretty comfortable and the battery will go about 4-6 hours . I think that 's about the most you can expect from a bluetooth headset .	1
I work for Verizon Wireless in their tech support department and I have yet to use a better Bluetooth headset . I 've owned 4 over the last year ; a Jabra , a Motorola , this one and another Plantronics . And I 've used several different ones over time in the testing process , and this is easily the best I 've used . The earlier Plantronics was also very good as well . The Jabra did n't have very good noise-reduction and the Motorola was a terrible purchase altogether . But this headset I can say with ease is superb . Great sound , it picks up very little in the way of ambient noise , and the charge lasts forever , seemingly ! UPDATE : When I originally purchased this device over 2 years ago , I di have to replace it back in July . Why ? Because I had it in a messenger bag that got stepped on . I used it just about every day , and the only reason I had to get a new headset is because it was physically damaged . Guess which headset I got to replace it ? THE SAME ONE ! If the previous one worked for over 2 years and only stopped working because it got stepped on , then this is the one I 'm sticking with for as long as they make them .	1
I first bought a headset for $ 30 . It worked well for about 10 ( maybe 12 ) minutes and then fell apart . So , I would not suggest considering anything under $ 100.Unless you consider this one.When I returned my first headset to Fry 's Electronics I asked them what their most popular model was . The sales guy said it was the Plantronics 510 . I tried it on and it felt really good . I 've been using it for about two months now and I love it to pieces . It works as well now as it did the moment I bought it ( actually , better , because it needed a charging ) .Positives:1 ) Comfort . This was the biggest attribute I was looking for as I wear this a lot . After putting it on I usually forget it is there within two minutes . It is light weight and very easy on the ears . I only remember when somebody calls me and I hear the beeping in my ears . With a flick of the wrist , this easily converts between the left and right ear and both feel extremely comfortable.2 ) Sturdy . I travel a lot and airports are not kind to any belongings , especially ones crammed into a bag . But this thing has taken its lickings and keeps on going . Must better than the first one I bought which fell apart over nothing.3 ) Great sound quality . I 've used this at airports , casinos , and convention centers . I can always hear my party without any problems and I 've never had anybody complain that they ca n't hear me.4 ) Simple to work . Probably the most difficult thing about this is getting it recognized by the phone . And that is n't complicated at all as that only took me 2 minutes , and most of that was searching for directions on how to do it . Picking up the phone is as easy as hitting a button.On a side note , I have two Bluetooth cellphones and I can switch between the two automatically without any hassle . Because of this ease of switching over I am considering getting the phone base so I can use this on my office line at home as well . I know somebody who uses it and she has no problems with it.Negatives:1 ) I wish there was a way to turn off the blinking blue light . It drives me crazy especially while driving at night . Half the times I see it blink I think I 'm getting pulled over . Also , it keeps blinking whether you are using it or not so I usually cover it with a hand towel when it is charging at night . But this seems to be inherent of any bluetooth device.2 ) Ummmm ... . I ca n't think of any other negatives.So , I highly suggest checking this one out . I ca n't say that this is for everybody because I 've learned that no two ears are exactly alike . The biggest thing I was looking for was comfort . While this is completely comfortable for me it might not be for you . But if you find it comfortable then I would HIGHLY recommend picking this up over anything else especially since the price is soooo right .	1
I have owned four Bluetooth headsets . This is by far the most comfortable and easiest to use . I have no problems with sore ears as with my other models ( Motorola , Jabra BT350 and BT800 ) and sometimes forget that I am wearing it . Good sound quality , fits well , stays on no matter what . The perfect headset !	1
I bought this on a reccomendation of a friend . My brother bought a Motorolla earpiece for about $ 30 more than I paid for mine . he hates his and I love mine . Most people never realize I am talking to them through a headset . You get 3 ear speakers of different sizes so you attach the one that is most comfortable for your ear.Best addition to my cell phone I have ever bought .	1
This unit has been very reliable over the last three years . I 've lost one and worn out the replacement . It has suffered much abuse . Even the slightest breeze makes it unusable , thats my only complaint . Sound quality is very good and the ear piece fits me very well .	1
You can tell by the other reviews that this headset works and pairs easily with most phones . It is a great device that has restored my faith in bluetooth technology.The other piece you should know is that this headset is extremely comfortable . It is not the best looking , but the design distributes the weight evenly across your entire ear , not just the top . It looks bulky and heavy , but the unit is very light . Other headsets I have tried do n't stay on , flop around , or are just in general uncomfortable . This one is n't - I put it on in the morning and pretty much forget that it is there the rest of the day.OK - the one flaw with this headset is the power button . Thankfully , you really only need to deal with it two times each day . The problem is n't necessarily that it is small - which it is - but it has a hard point on it and the button is difficult to press down.I highly recommend this headset . Enjoy	1
Like most people I have purchased multiple Bluetooth headsets and struggled with poor reception , I ca n't hear the caller or they ca n't hear me . This Plantronics Voyager 510 headset did n't have any of these problems . The device simply worked and I have used it for years.The headset will operate for 6 hours of talk time and 100 hours of standby time and is ideal for me to use when traveling and especially when driving . The noise canceling microphone worked well in that people could hear me but not all the background noise like wind or rain on the windshield . The earpiece is comfortable to wear and is light enough that you forget you have it on.The headset has the feature to operate with two Bluetooth devices simultaneously and the smart technology feature connects you to the proper device with a touch of a button . The headset boom swivels to fit the location that is best for you and even folds into a small form for easy storage . The head set will operate up to 33 feet from your Bluetooth device so if your phone is in your briefcase or in the back seat of the car you can still take calls.The unit also features Adaptive Frequency Hopping to find a free channel to avoid interference from other WIFI/WLAN sources . I have tried about 10 Bluetooth devices over the years and this one was simply the one that performed the best .	1
I have been in the wireless industry for over 10 years . Ive tried but failed several times to find a GREAT bluetooth headset . Until I came accross this unit.To simplify- It works perfectly ! No outside noise , its lightweight and comfortable.Most important , is that there is no outside interference.Its the best unit I have used to date . I bought two of them . One for my wife and myself.I highly recomend this unit ! ! Go get it ! Joel	1
We have two , and we love them . They work very well , like much better than the Motorola 's we had , and these are quite stylish and unobtrusive . Now , I will say that I switch back and forth between the smallest ear piece and none at all - with it , it fits better and you can hear better , but it starts hurting a little after a while , have to take a break ; without it , I can wear it all day , but , it dangles a little awkwardly and sound is sacrificed , a little , but certainly bearable .	1
Easy to set up and use , excellent sound quality , light and comfortable . You ca n't go wrong for the price .	1
No complaints here . Excellent sound quality - the volume can be turned up nice and loud . Fewest `` bluetooth clicking noises '' of any bluetooth device I 've used . Hardly hear them at all unless you walk to far away from the source.I have this Voyager 510 paired with both my Treo 650 and Skype on my laptop ( using the Anycom USB 250 I reviewed previously ) The headset picks up the call from whoever rings first every time . I love it ! ! Skype call comes in , and the headset rings - call comes in on the Treo 650 and the headset rings . What 's not to like ? ? ? I love the fit too - I think it 's the best I 've tried on . I also have the Scala 700x which is about as light you could imagine in a headset . But , it 's almost a little too light ( and fragile ) . Honestly , I like them both but need to have a backup . Now that I think of it , I believe my wife just inherited a Scala 700x.The 510 feels like it 's built to take some abuse which I think is a plus and yet it 's lighter than I expected - to be honest . It 's been around for a little while so I was afraid it might be a little heavy . I 'm pleasantly surprised that it 's very light . I mean the fit is so perfect , you could go running while wearing it or certainly work out in the gym without any worries.I have n't put the `` wind cancellation '' to the test yet but I will and then I 'll update this review . But , honestly , when I saw all the positive reviews here on Amazon ( 1200 or so ? ) and many of them Treo 650 users , I figured it was a fairly safe bet and I 'm very satisfied with the purchase so far.The Scala works great with the Treo 650 too . It 's hard to tell which one sounds louder - I 'll experiment a little more and then write in once I have a winner .	1
This is my second headset replacing the Motorola one that came with my cell phone . People I call tell me that the sound is very clear on their end and can not tell that I am using the headset - sounds just like I am talking into the phone . That was not the case with the first one . I travel a lot and wear the headset for long periods . My ear does not get tired or sore from having it on . The headset seems well balanced and never seems like it is going to fall off regardless of what I am doing . I also like that it folds flat for easy carrying in my shirt pocket .	1
Wonderful bluetooth headset . Great sound and minimal background noise for those on the other end of the phone . Connected easily to my Sanyo Katana II cellular phone as well as my bluetooth USB device for both use with both my Skype and Vonage talk accounts . Only complaint , the volume control could be easier to adjust . I end up using the the volume control on the phone which is a bit easier and I can see where the level setting is at .	1
This is a good headset ; nothing flashy , nothing top-of-the-line , but a good product that does its job . It 's not one of the newer A2DP headsets that do audio other than a phonecall , but if you do n't need that , it 's good for just phonecalls . It 's a little bulky , but sturdy and fits well .	1
Let 's just get down to it . If you are reading this review because you are shopping for a new Bluetooth headset , just go ahead and finishing reading the next couple sentences and then you can do what I did ... buy the Plantronics Voyager 510 at Amazon ( for under $ 45.00 as of this review ) . I own 10 different headsets and have used them all to make hundreds of calls in all types of environments , and since we can only really rate products on a curve , there is currently no better choice at this time ( things will no doubt change one day ) . It is the most stable , the most ergonomic , the most static free ( there is no such thing as a completely static free wireless product ) , the most efficient with it 's battery usage , most comfortable ( a somewhat subjective attribute ) , the most bang for the buck , the most satisfying to use , and the most 5 star rated Bluetooth Headset money can buy . I can only really complain about one thing ... a very sensitive microphone that will pick up wind noise in moderately windy conditions ( in spite of the noise cancelling technology ) , but this is certainly true with every headset that I have used and probably true with ALL headsets when you come down to it .	1
Simply awesome , the best one I ever had , sticking to this one after 1 motorola , 1 nokia and 1 samsung .	1
I am a moderate user , and this device will be charged long enough for me to go Monday through Friday at work.At work , I can have my cell phone ( Motorola V365 ) connected via Bluetooth and setting up high enough that it can pick up a decent signal while I am moving around in poor signal areas . Further , I keep my phone 's ringer on 'silent ' so coworkers do n't know when I receive a phone call . The headset simply beeps in my ear , and I click it to take the call . If I am in a meeting or the boss is talking to me , I simply let it beep in my ear 4 or 5 times until the call goes to voicemail . No one even knows I had a call coming ! If I am on the phone and someone important walks up to say something , I can easily stop responding to the person on my headset . They get the point pretty quickly , because they can hear the person I am talking to just about as clearly as I can ! Now , if you want a nice quiet conversation in a cubical , you can scoot up close to a flat object ( I use my flatscreen monitor ) and talk in a very low voice . The sound reflects off of the monitor , so it is easier for your caller to hear your low voice volume without cupping your hand over your mouth piece or without trying to hold the mouth piece closer to your lips.I liked this so much I bought one for my wife . Her older phone ( Motorola V557 ) drops the bluetooth signal much more often than mine does . Also , she goes outside more often than I do , and it seems like sunlight interferes with the bluetooth radio frequency . My wife loves keeping her phone on silent with the headset , because this way the baby does n't wake up whenever a phone call comes in . My wife 's complaint is that the signal gets dropped a lot , but she sometimes leaves the phone in the living room whenever she makes a quick trip to the bedroom - and that 's just too far away.Next , I bought one for my dad . But , he 's one of those old timers that will never change . I ca n't seem to get him to put one of these 'new fangled things ' on his ear . I guess these are n't for everyone ! : )	1
Great Bluetooth headset . This is my second one - the first was stolen so I purchased one just like it .	1
I purchased this for my self to use with my Motorola V3XX . I got home on the delivory day to find that my husband had fallen in love with it . He had allready paired it to his Blackberry . I had to purchase this one for my self . I have had only one problem and my husband has the same one . We are not able to walk more than 10 ' from my phone before we get the crackeling sounds and loose the ability to communicate with the person on the phone . We love the sound quality ! We love the quality we get on he other end . The person on the phone says it all sounds great .	1
When I first got this headset , I originally rated it at 4 stars . I 've had it for 5 months now , and I 'd have to lower the rating to 3 stars . I really do n't hear much better with the headset than I did the Jabra headset I had before ; it 's a little better , but not worth the extra $ 45.00 in price . The other party can hear me better ( which I attribute to the longer mic . ) , but they also hear everything going on around me too . The noise cancellation feature is not great . Also , I find the earpiece hurts my ear if I wear it much more than a half-hour . The battery life , on the other hand , is great . I can go several days on one charge . In summary , I 'm still in the market for a better headset .	1
This was my first bluetooth headset and I have used for more than 8 months now . It is perfectly fit for me and I am satisfied with the quality of voice both ways.Pros:1 . Very flexible and can fit as u like.2 . Can be used on both ears3 . Voice activated dialing works , so it is convenient to call someone while driving.4 . Battery retains charge for quite long time , depending on your talk time.5 . filter for air noise works . I tested it while driving on highway with open window . Caller confirmed very little air noise disturbance and great voice quality.Cons:1 . Switch off little inconvenient to use when it is on your ear . But the flip side is that you would like to keep it on , while on your ear . So , not a problem.2 . Some reviewers have mentioned , difficulty in positioning on ear due to flexibility . But it is not a big issue , since once positioned , it stays there . **- > The best thing I liked is the Customer Service from Plantronics . My first headset developed some problem with the microphone and people were not able to listen to me . I called Plantronics on a Sunday evening and the rep guided me through the online warranty form , very nicely and I got my replacement part within three days . Perfect..is n't it ?	1
It 's a pretty good device . The clarity is really good and the sound is great as well .	1
I 've used this Bluetooth for close to three years . It worked very well for a long time , but recently the sound quality is beginning to wane , making it hard to hear . It fades in and out from moderately good sound to really poor sound .	1
Having had the Motorolla HT850 , I liked its light weight and ease to turn on but it was never loud enough for driving . The Plantronics 510 is very loud and fits well . My only negative is the small power on switch . All in all , I vote for the Plantronics	1
The headset works very well . The noise reduction is not that great , the Jawbone is better at it . However , the overall sound quality both ways is better and the fit is more comfortable than the Jawbone . It is light and seems large at first but is very easy to fold up and is quite sturdy . Especially for the price , this is a great choice !	1
This is a really nice headset . I got this to cut down on exposure to microwave transmissions . It is easy to use and works very good when wind exposure is low . With the increase in wind your voice is sometimes distorted and the person at the other end gets intermittent breakup of your voice . This happens with all Bluetooth headsets but less with this one . You can eliminate this problem by cupping your hand over the mic while talking . This blocks the wind from the mic ! It is comfortable if you do n't mind the loop part that goes over your ears . The bigger the ear lobe the easier it will stay on your ears and feel comfortable . I have moderate size ear lobes and it feels OK over my ear but takes time to adjust to feel comfortable . But it is about the best bluetooth out there . I have also bought a wired stereo headset by MEE -model M9P . This is a great product if you want wired small earbuds which sound real nice with your ipod and works great with 3.5mm jack cell phones ! Both have their good points depending on what you want them for . 510 Bluetooth for wireless needs and MEE-M9P for cell phone and stereo listening on your ipod ! ! ! !	1
I bought this headset to use in while driving . The connection is really good . I have small ears and it was always a problem for me to find a headset or earphones . Luckily this headset has 3 different pieces to fit in your ear . The only problem is that it is hard to put it on although very comfy afterwards . Recommended .	1
This headset was purchased to replace a Jabra BT8040 . The goal was to get a headset in which 1 ) people could hear me clearly and 2 ) I could hear them clearly . After having this Plantronics headset for over a month , I am very pleased with the purchase so far . With this headset , I have had no complaints that callers ca n't hear me or complaints of interference . Also , I am able to hear the caller well.In researching buetooth headsets , I opted for this one based on the performance review and price point .	1
I have owned over a dozen different models of bluetooh headsets . This is the best sounding and most comfortable of all of them so far . The range is good , battery life is good I only wish they came with more ear inserts as spares .	1
I ordered this product so I could talk handsfree in the car with the air conditioner running . It worked as well as I had hoped .	1
A little bulky on the ear for a petite woman , but overall very good quality and battery life . I can hear others very clear and have had no complaints that I am hard to hear .	1
Reader , I 've had Sony Ericsson , Logitech Mobile Freedom , Cario Scala 500 , Plantronics Discovery 640 , and finally this Voyager 510 . Let me just say that my prior favorite was the Logitech but it was a little bulky and it disconnected from my phone after most calls ( annoying ) .Having said that I now enjoy Plantronics Voyager 510 . The higher model , Discovery 640 does n't stand a chance . Yes the 640 is smaller , cooler-looking , but the features are not good . The 640 has no windguard , no noice-cancelling tech , and the talk time is short . The extra battery charger they give you and try to say that it boosts talk time does not . You ca n't talk and charge at the same time . Sheesh.OKay , so now with the Voyager 510 , I love it . Great fit . It seems Plantronics has come out with a new version of the 510 . The foam mic boom is not removeable but is built in much like the logitech is . The voice and sound quality are top notch . I 've recorded myself and it sounds clear . I can even notice a difference with the noise-cancelling technology as the tv was on in the background , but my voice was still clear . Noice-cancelling is important.Pros : Clear , audible soundMic is sensitive and my voice for callers are clearWind-GuardNoise-Cancelling technology ( must have ! ) Fit - stays on confortably and they give 3 earphone-like inserts ( perfect ) Cons : the only thing is that the mic boom seems to rub up on my cheek or is very close so sometimes it will make a scratching sound for the caller ( since it 's rubbing against my cheek ) . I have n't heard that complaint from other reviewers here so maybe it 's unique to me . I do n't have big cheeks so I do n't get it .	1
I can easily sing the praises of the Voyager 510 , especially at the price point . It does ALMOST everything well . The only nit I can pick is this : in spite of Plantronics ' claim otherwise , it is TERRIBLE in wind . An easy fix would be just a little foam around the microphone . Overall , it 's a really , really good device .	1
I was n't sure if I wanted to purchase another bluetooth headset because the last one I purchased , a Motorola HS815 , was terrible . People were saying that they could n't hear me or that there was too much static . I figured it would be the same thing next time . Boy was I wrong . This headset is terrific . I will give you some pros and cons : Pros : ClarityEase of UseBattery LifeVery Comfortable to wearDoes Not Fall OffThe only con is , I sometimes have difficulty intially putting it on becasue I wear glasses . I occassionally have to use two hands to put it on my ear correctly.I would definitely recommend this item .	1
Not the smallest or cutest bluetooth , but certainly the most reliable in my experience . I 've had it for over a year and it still works perfectly , which is more than I can say for my previous bluetooth devices .	1
I 've had 3 headsets already , and each one had something about it that I did n't like . I hesitated to buy this one , despite the great reviews , because I wanted one that did n't give me the 'telemarketer ' look . Top things I was looking for were : sound quality , comfort , and battery life . This unit delivers on all 3 counts . It sounds fantastic , it 's really comfortable ( especially with the Jabra EarGels on the ear piece ) , and the battery lasts a long time . Looking back , this is the one that I should have bought in the first place . Recommended .	1
I admit , I was turned off at first by the size and shape , but was easily won over by the quality of the sound and the comfort . This is as good as bluetooth gets.The downsides are the rediculously small buttons for power and volume , which are almost unusable for most , but fine for me.Today I thought I lost my headset . I found it in a parking lot , ran over at least once , in the rain for at least 12 hours . 10 minutes under a hair drier and it was working again ! I will buy another when the time comes .	1
This headset is reasonable in price and provides the best hearing and talking no matter where I am . Size does not meam heavy .	1
The last bluetooth device I owned had poor reception . The sound quality on this device is clear enough to hear in my car with the windows down . I would recommend to anyone . Great ear piece !	1
The Plantronics 510 is comfortable to wear for hours and does n't feel like it will fall off your ear . It mates easily to my Treo 650 and also to my Bluetooth-enable laptop , which makes it possible to use the laptop for VoIP calls . Reception is good , volume is adequate and the people I talk with say that my voice is clear . The controls are a bit stiff , as others have said . But that means they have good tactile feedback -- you know when you 've pressed a button.One marginal shortcoming : the 510 's clarity is n't good enough for it to replace the wired Plantronics USB headset I use for dictating to Dragon Systems `` Naturally Speaking '' voice recognition software on the laptop . But that would be a stretch for any wireless headset.Prices vary widely ; shop around .	1
This is the best product I have gotten for my cell phone and I have had many of these blue tooths . But this one is the best people hear me clearly and there is no noise in the background that they can hear as well ... .	1
When I purchased this headset , I was skeptical . After searching the internet for reviews on the top headsets to get , I continuously saw this one in the top 10 . For half of the top ten sites I reviewed , this headset was in the top 5 . So I purchased it.I use the headset with my iPhone 3G and DO N'T REGRET IT . I love this headset-my first one . I received 3 interchangeable earpieces and the mouth/ear connect swivels so that you can wear it on either ear . The sound is very clear most of the time . I noticed in very noisey environments , there is a moment of echoes while the piece adjusts.I find it easy to answer calls , and send them back to my cell phone when necessary . I can easily adjust the volume as well and recalling the last number is two clicks away.I gave this piece only a 4 for the following reasons:1-The thickness of the 'ear hang ' causes fatigue on the ear and after awhile mild soarness.2-Brief period of echoes while adjusting in noisey areas.3-About 15 % of the time , I must talk louder than normal in order for the other person to hear me . However , I must take into account this maybe due to interferences on the other parties behalf.Over all GREAT JOB .	1
As everyone else says , it sounds very clear , comfortable , and sounds crystal clear for the people listening to you . It sounds better than my phone itself .	1
I 've had this for 2 years now and am pleased with quality , durability , and reliability . It is surprisingly comfortable considering the girth of the piece that goes over and behind the ear . My past headsets with earloops were horribly painful after a very short time , this one I can wear for hours , barely noticing it . It came with 3 different earpieces - one small , one large , and one teardrop shaped - so fit was not a problem . Sound quality is good enough that people frequently comment on how clear I sound and I am nearly always using it in the car . Wind cancellation really is insufficient , but this has not been a major issue for me ... I just use it with the windows up or mostly up . I frequently leave this thing on overnight and still use it for a couple of days afterwards with no loss of power . Talk time is at least the 6 hours claimed and stand-by time can be measured in days . Some people are troubled by the proprietary power cord , but it 's a small matter as I have a household-type plug in my car and charge it while driving if need be , though it can not be charged and used simultaneously . I came here to see if I wanted to upgrade to another Plantronics model and pass this headset on to my daughter , but I think I 'm going to keep it and buy her the same model.UPDATE : Still a 5 star item and I am on my second one . After 2.5 years the first one broke at the top of the earloop . I taped it with sports tape and kept using it without any problems , but I figured it was only a matter of time before it did n't work anymore so I replaced it . Others have said that the new 510s are junk , but I 've been using mine for about 5 months now and it 's exactly as great as the original . The broken one is still working , too .	1
Update 11/11/2008My wife 's died about two weeks ago . I emailed the company explaining I bought it from Amazon and mentioned it is within the warranty period . I did not hear anything for about a week , and then , a replacement appeared at my house , sent via express mail . It is a refurb , but that is their condition , and it looks and works perfectly . Awesome customer service . Just one more reason to get this product ! I have used this for a month , and I love it . I have been searching for a decent bluetooth headset , and after using it for about a month , I can tell you it is great . The sound is very good and clear . I have no complaints from anyone I speak with , and usually they do n't even know I am using a headset . There are only two negatives , and they really are not that bad . First , turning it on and off is not easy . That is not really a bad thing , but it is a little awkward . My second complaint would take off half a star , and that is , my usb car charger can not work with it , and I had to buy a seperate charger . It is much easier to answer and hang up , when compared to others I have used . It is VERY comfortable , and I sometimes forget that I am wearing it. , as witnessed by my wife who often reminds me tha tI am still wearing it . I bought this because my wife 's set died and she needed a new one . Ehem , it seems that I somehow ended up with this one and she got my old piece of & $ # % ( @ ( insert your guess of brand here ) because she was used to it . Well , she now has her own and loves it as well , though she also complains about the on/off button . I should also note that my Verizon Razor , which often would not recognize the Verizon blue tooth headset I had , has no problem QUICKLY hooking up with this headset . I really love it and would recommend it to anyone . Lastly , the battery life is very good .	1
I have had two motorola bluetooth headsets and they both either did not have a clear signal or when you are speaking with someone there was an echo . This one I got from Plantronics is by far the best I have ever had and from what I 've read the best on the market right now . I would advise bluetooth shoppers to stay away from Motorola bluetooth headsets .	1
The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset is perfect in reception and transmission.- Ear piece & MicrophoneThe reception on the ear piece is clear and loud . The microphone works flawlessly to faithfully relay your voice to the receiving end without little or no distortion or muffles.- Bluetooth FunctionThe bluetooth provides rock-solid connectivity . I 've never had problems with broken or sporadic connection problems.- FormThe ear piece is comfortable . It take some effort , however , to put on the headphone . It is a somewhat awkward maneuver that involves the use of both hands to pull the `` loop '' open so it can go around the back of your ear while simultaneously wrestling with the ear piece to direct it into your ear.The Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset functions flawlessly . However , I found that the design of the headset makes it an inconvenience to put on . Apart from the flawed ergonomics , this headset is just about perfect - 4.5 Stars !	1
I waited to review this product to see if time would show it is no good , and it did not show me that . This is the best blue tooth device i have ever seen or used and have already convinced 3 other people to switch . The battery lasts for I would guess about 8 hrs of talk time and 2-3 weeks without a charge with me only using it a little each day . The sound is better than using my phone and people can hear me without any static . The only improvement that I can think of is to put a battery meeter to let you know how much power is left instead of it just dying on you . I just try to charge it every 1-2 weeks now before it dies and it is great .	1
I bought two of this for my gf and myself , it has high quality and easy to use . I like it !	1
This unit always synchs up and works perfectly . Every time . Comfortable and good volume , easy to adjust and end calls . No hassles . Strong battery life . More subtle with much of it behind the ear , definitely not as goofy looking as the star-trek-look devices with bright LED 's and ear hardware . ( I think there should be a law that if you wear ONE of those , you have to wear TWO , thus identifying yourself as a hopeless techno-geek . )	1
The reviews available on this product from the amazon website really helped me make a great decision.This model may not be the `` latest '' technology but it 's enough for me . I only use it in the car because of all the issues that have been raised about driving safety . I feel better with both hands on the wheel , both eyes on the road.I 'm not a device geek but this really works for me and the few requirements i have.Simple to use , I set it up in 10 min max.Fits fine , but I do activate the connection before i go down the road because the buttons are small and can be difficult to activate if you already have it behind your ear .	1
The people I talk to while using this earpiece ca n't even tell I am on a Bluetooth . No windnoise or static . A little big , but you have to sacrifice something in order to get good sound .	1
I have a Jabra headset for my work PDA/phone , and it works very well . But , with the new CA law regarding phone use in the car , I needed one which could switch between two phones . This does just that and it does it remarkably well.Although you can not switch while in a conversation very easily ( you have to hold the call button until it beeps twice to release the call to the phone mic/speaker and then could pick up the call , but have no easy way to switch back ) , it handles the obvious uses well . If one phone starts ringing , the headset correctly selects it so you can pick up the call - perfect.The headset is comfortable for very long calls , with a good balance on the ear.The microphone stalk is not as movable as the product brief suggests , and it does not fold up per se ( sticks out no matter where positioned ) . Folding up the mic does not power off , which is a shame , although the battery life seems really good.Sound quality is good on the speaker and appears to be good on the other end , although I have not heard the other side to know for sure.Only downside vs. the Jabra is that it does not have a USB charger ( small cord to plug into laptop when traveling ) , so you have to drag along the transformer .	1
The Plantronics Voyager 510 has been an absolute work horse for me for the past nearly 2 years . When I say workhorse I mean it . I put over 5 hours of talk time on this device 5 days a week for well over a year . I used it in a weekly 4 hour commute , during the day in the office , at night to talk to my family from the hotel and a number of other usages . I know this device and using it is as familiar as turning on my blinker in the car.The Good:1 . Great noise filtering . The microphone does a great job of filtering out ambient noise including wind.2 . The battery is excellent and lasts for days on standby and for at least 6 hours talking.3 . Multipoint Technology . This technology rocks . I have both my work ( Blackberry ) and personal cell phone synched with this device at the same time and can call or answer either without pairing hassles.4 . Pairs with a device that it has been setup with by simply pressing the primary button.5 . Volume buttons on earpiece.6 . Comes with multiple earpieces for comfort.7 . Stable in the ear . It does n't feel as if it will fall out.8 . Durable . I used this hard for a few years and it has only now started to fall apart . Still works though.9 . Shares common power supply with many other Plantronics devices for ease of power sharing.10 . Larger then competitors but very light.The Not so Good:1 . It is bigger then most other devices.2 . The earpieces are prone to fall out and do n't stay secured after about 6 months.As you can see I really do n't have much bad to say about this device . I am only now replacing it after 2 years of use and that is because the earpiece fell out and I ca n't find the pack that came with it . It still works ! I replaced this unit with the Plantronics Discovery 925 and I might like that even better . For the money though you can not beat the Voyager 510 in my opinion . 5 stars !	1
This was the best Bluetooth I have owned because of performance and more importantly the fit . It was very comfortable on my ear and inside the ear , and I could keep it on for hours and not even remember it was there . Sound quality and features are excellent and worked as advertised . I have used with various phones . I used it every day for about 2 years until it started to break at the hinge . I used to just stuff it in my purse without a special case or protection , so I am not surprised it finally gave in . I see this product being sold for a lot of $ $ $ now , but I do n't think I paid more than $ 40 for it . So it was a great deal and a great value . If I see it on sale again , I would buy it .	1
This is only my 2nd headset , and I much prefer it to the Motorola HS850 . It stays in your ear and has plenty of volume to overcome road noise in a car . However , when my headset is on for extended periods , it sometimes experiences problems ( will answer calls but not transfer them to the earpiece ) . Turning headset off then on again fixes this problem . Battery life and charge time seems excellent , but I do n't have much to compare it to . For those wanting to use it with your office phone also , the Plantronics bluetooth office phone adapter is EXPENSIVE ( $ 200+ in Office Depot ) .	1
I bought this due to the law changing to hands free in my state . I am not a big fan of bluetooth but I saw the writing on the wall so I read the reviews and picked this one . I am glad I did ! This was very very simple to set up and charged very quickly . It synced easily with my android phone . I like that it comes with various sizes ear buds so you can get the right fit . It stays securely on my ear and I never feel like it is flapping or going to fall off . When I make calls , the person I am calling says I sound like I am talking directly on the handset so I am pleased . I have not tried any of the voice command features yet so I can not comment on those . Overall , I am pleased and would definitely recommend this headset !	1
I 've been able to carry conversations in my bedroom and bathroom while the phone itself sits in the living room ! The reception has been amazing . I travel beyond 30 ft in different parts of my apartment and still get clear calls . My friends ca n't tell that I 'm on a BT headset . In fact , they say it 's clearer than if I were on a wired earpiece . My problem with dropped calls has plummeted to almost nothing because I now position my phone in a decent area and talk wherever with this Plantronics BT.This is an ugly headset compared to others , but it works ! There 's no point in having a cute BT if I ca n't use it . I have to use the smallest earpieces provided , but it stays on pretty well .	1
This is my first Bluetooth headset . I purchased it because it seemed to get the most positive reviews out of all that I looked at . It has performed very well . People say they can here me as well if not better than when I use the phone itself . I would recommend it.The one problem I sometimes have , in using it with my Motorola e815 , is that it will sometimes become unpaired , randomly . I believe it 's specific to this phone as reported by others . It seems to happen about a minute after 1 out of 20 calls . I found sometimes it will pair to the phone again by quickly pressing the side button twice ( which then causes the phone to redial , so you then need to end the call ) . The other way is to turn the phone off and back on again . The latest thing I tried is turning off the phone 's powersave feature . I 've heard from others that that feature could be causing the problem , but we will see . I probably should get a new phone anyway since mine is 2 1/2 years old . Then the unpairing problem will likely disappear .	1
The Plantronics Voyager 510 is a great headset for the right situation . I 've owned a 510 for three years , this latest one to replace the last one the dog chewed up ( literally ) .The 510 is a comfortable headset with good battery life . The quality of the audio I hear is very good , and the quality of the audio my callers hear is also very good . However , the unit just returned would continuously send a low level static to callers , which was n't the case with my prior 510 . I assume this was just a defective unit.The big strength of this headset is dealing with noise . In comparison to the other two headsets I gave serious consideration , the Motorola H710 and the Jabra BT8040 , the 510 had the best audio in all conditions . One test was driving down the highway with all 4 windows down , the radio on at a moderate volume and the headset in the right ear . Cabin noise was so loud that I felt the need to raise my voice level to hear myself . I was able to hear callers over the noise just barely , and they could hear me , but did hear a lot of background noise as one would expect . With the H710 , I could hear callers well , but I was completely unintelligible to them . The BT8040 was almost as good as the 510 ; callers heard me almost as well as with the 510 , but I had trouble hearing callers because the audio was cutting in and out , as if echo cancellation was getting confused by all the noise . All three worked quite well in quieter environments . The H710 fails to cancel echo ( of my voice back to me ) when paired with a Uniden cordless land-line phone ( with BT support ) . The BT8040 fails to pair with the Uniden cordless phone at all.I ultimately kept the BT8040 and returned the 510 because of some shortcomings of the 510 . First , it is tricky to get on and off . It took me a long time to figure out how to put it on using one hand , and it takes some fumbling . It 's far easier and faster to use 2 hands to put it on , but this is a hassle , and frankly looks stupid when you 're doing it . I do n't like wearing it all the time because it is big and the darn blue light flashes all the time , grabbing the attention of others around you . I feel like I 'm on exhibit when I try to wear the 510 around others . Finally , the 510 is not a good shape for keeping it in your pocket , and it 's large enough that the phone and the headset in the same pocket is n't usually workable . Which brings us back to the dog and the chewed up headset . Because of its poor pocketability , I would tend to leave it on the desk or table when not in use . Doggie finally figured this out.For use exclusively as a car or office headset , I 'd pick the 510 over all three . But for versatility in a wider range of uses , the BT8040 works best for me .	1
Yes , I have three headsets . I have two for the car , and one for use in the house . I chose to put the best one , this one , in the car along with a second cheap one , as a backup . I 'm terrible at remembering to charge these guys up ! And I 'm too cheap to purchase a car charger ... This is really a great headset . I 've never had a problem with people not being able to hear me and it 's very comfortable to wear . The battery lasts a long time , which is one reason I just forget to charge it . Once the battery dies , I use my backup headset until I charge up my favorite ! The other headsets are cheapy models I 've purchase on amazon when they were a Goldbox deal , and those are also good . They were around $ 10 and work fine . They just are not as comfortable to wear and the sound quality is not as sharp , both for me and for who I am speaking with . If I wear the cheapy ones for more than 15 minutes , my ear will start to ache a little . I can wear this one all day if I wanted to and it would n't bother me at all.I would purchase this one again FOR SURE . I 've had mine for about 18 months and I 'm sure at some point I will trash it and need another . I 'm really happy with this headset .	1
For me the sound quality is by far the most important factor when I compare headsets . Everything else is secondary . I drive a very noisy construction van so background noise is a serious problem . I have compared 8 different headsets and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is the only one that allows a clear conversation in this environment . I have used it daily for over 2 years and often for 6+ hours straight until the battery is dead . In a loud , dirty , construction environment , often lying on the ground , it 's the only thing I 've found that works . With the other models , either I , the caller , or both of us could n't understand a word being said . For those of you that do n't have background noise issues , I can add that even in quiet settings this unit has better sound quality than all the others that I tested . The way that I do my tests is to pair 2 headsets , put one in each ear and then switch between them while on the same call . This way I and the caller can compare the sound quality at almost the exact same time . The 2 cons I can mention are that the on/off button is too small and hard to push , and that when the battery is almost dead the buttons stop working ( even though the sound continues fine ) so you have to hang up using the phone instead of the headset . To be fair though , the `` almost dead battery '' symptoms happen in many of the other ones I 've tested also . I do n't care , sound is everything .	1
This is the best Bluetooth I have had . It is clear and very comfortable . All the others I have tried hurt my ear after a while but this one never does . It 's like you are n't even wearing it . It is clear when people are talking to you as well as clear to them when you are talking . You ca n't go wrong this this headset at all .	1
could n't be happier with this . and those who are embarrassed by its `` large '' size may want to consider being less insecure .	1
I 've had other bluetooth head sets - I found them uncomfortable to wear and I was always asking people to repeat themselves . This headset fits nicely on my ear - sometimes I forget it 's even on ! And for the very first time EVER I had to turn the volume down ! I only gave it four stars because the volume controls are difficult to get to , but that 's a small price to pay for the clarity you get .	1
I have never had a Bluetooth headset before the 510 . I use it with a Motorola i870 Nextel phone . The headset works great , sometimes it disconnects for a moment and I just press the button on the side of the headset and it reconnects . The talk time is awesome and I have gotten almost 5 hours continuous talk time out of the device . The range is n't too bad I think I can get about 30 feet from my i870 . If only my crappy Nextel phone could keep up will the quality of the headset . Since my i870 battery goes dead in like 1 1/2 with the extended batter pack I have to plug it in to charge . However , while it 's plugged in I can still use the 510 and wander all over the house and still talk on the phone . It almost replaces the phone if I could dial from it . The best part is that when you get too far away it gets a little static so that you know to come back closer and then the sound quality clears up . Everyone I have spoken with on the headset says it sounds very nice and clear.Overall I would suggest this headset to anyone because it works , it 's cheap and it wears extremely comfortable on your ear .	1
I 've had this earpiece for years and it still works as well as it did on day one . Never had any problems ; never falls out my ear . Sound is great .	1
Ever since i bought this headset I have become a fan of it . Its so comfortable I can wear it whole day without even feeling anythin is on , voice is crystal clear and its very easy to use . It pairs perfectly with my nokia 6610 as well as with my Dell Laptop so i use it for both VOIP calls and mobile phone calls . Also the service was great . I received the package right on the estimated date and never had to followup with anyone . A Superb Product ! ! !	1
It is very difficult to find a Bluetooth headset that will work well with the Palm Treo . This one does . It has good quality sound and does not cut out .	1
Purchase through Amazon 4 months ago . Works great with my Razr phone . I 'm a truck driver and have had problems in the past with hearing other party and with other party hearing background noise . I can hear very well with this bluetooth . The person I 'm talking to ca n't tell I 'm on a bluetooth about 90 % of the time . I found that alot of the sound quality towards who I am speaking with has a lot to do with what they are talking on . I ca n't talk with Verizon customer service with this on . Calls are crystal clear while speaking with another person with a handsfree unit on . Speaking with someone on a landline is pretty good clarity for them , they can tell if my window is open or not and if boom is too far from cheek they can hear alot of background noise . No matter who I talk to I can hear great every time .	1
I 've owned and used several different models over a couple of years , and the 510 is hands down the best I 've used so far . Battery life is excellent , fit is excellent , sound quality and mic quality is excellent . Got mine when the price temporarily dipped to under $ 40 , can not beat it at this price . Highly recommended .	1
I gave one of these away 2 years ago , when it failed to stay paired with my BB Pearl . Decided to give it another try with my MotoQGlobal ( ATT ) , and am thoroughly satisfied . Reception is great , and there is an audible signal for every function , including receipt of e-mail or text messages . Great purchase at just over $ 40 ! ! UPDATE 8/5/2009 : Just stopped working , with no warning . Out of warranty , unfortunately .	1
I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each . Insuffcient volume and insecure attachment to my ear . Whenever I moved , the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off . They never did but it was still annoying . The volume problem was in part related to this . The contact with my ear was n't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I have been satisfied with my Plantronics 510 . The choice of 3 interchangable ear cushions , great volume , crisp output and decent range make it unbeatable . The battery life is somewhat less that the motorola headsets , but I purchased an extra charger for home . The power button is small , but using it is a minor problem that resolves with a little practice . The sound is crisp and clear . The range is as good or better than the motorola sets .	1
I bought mine from Amazon cuz this was just about the lowest price I could find . Before I actually bought it I did some serious testing and reading about other headsets . I 've tried Jabra 250 , Jabra 500 , Motorola HS850 and they all had one major problem - quite static-y . Actually the HS850 was a little better in this area than the Jabra headsets . I 've had Jabra 250 for almost two years - static-y big time . If I put the phone in my left pant pocket and the headset on the right ear theres ' noise all the time - this is not acceptable for me . The HS850 , unlike the Jabra , has poor design . Any time I turn my head sharply this thing is flabbing on my ear as if it 's going to fly out at any moment . This is why I wanted something better , not the same.I went on Amazon and read reviews on all kinds of headsets and my attention stopped on the Plantronics Voyager 510 from some company I 'd never heard of . The the reviews were good . Even though my BestBuy store did n't carry it I decided to make the investment , buy it online and test it in the hopes to keep it.I received my headset , hooked it up to my phone - that was easy , no problem here.Then as soon as I started using it I noticed that there was no static , almost no static . I could keep my phone anywhere around me and there would be no static - a major advantage to the previous headsets.Then I noticed how easy it is to answer phone calls with it . the answer button is large enough , right against the ear , so I just had to press it against the ear using one finger . How cool is that ? ! The HS850 design was like that too but the Jabra 250 needed two fingers to answer one to support the headset and the other to press the answer button - I noticed with the new Jabra 500 that was n't an issue anymore.The Plantronics is light , easy to put on , not flabby - wraps around your ear pretty good.There 's only a few things I did n't like about it and I hope the manufacturer is listening now:1 . Picks up surrounding noise . If I am out people can hardly hear what I 'm saying - even if there 's hardly any wind . It 's so bad that I 've given up on using it outside.2 . The ear bud needs to be tinier . I loved the small jelly-type of earpiece that Jabra had - you could hardly feel it in your ear.3 . The power button is too tiny and hard to push . Not that this is a big deal because I hardly ever need to shut down my headset but it would be nice to have one that 's larger still one that 's not easy to hit by accident.I did n't give this review five stars because the headset needs to do a better job at fending off surrounding noise.Other than that , I highly recommend this headset . I have yet to see a headset that 's as good as this one !	1
My first BT headset was a Motorola HS850 . Worked well until the recharge plug snagged on the socket and parts of the socket came out with the power plug . So I replaced it with the Plantronics 510 . I wanted an earpiece that inserted into my ear as oppose to laying on top of my ear like the old World War 2 headsets of 50 years ago . I sometimes am in noisy environments and the `` lay on the ear '' type is not designed to isolate loud distracting noises . The HS850 was difficult for me to hook over my ear and took both hands at times . Not so with the Plantronics , at least for me . It goes on my ear much easier and the earplug type earpiece shuts out more of the noisy world attempting to interrupt my communications . The earplug type earpiece also provides vastly improved volume . I had to crank up the MOT to full and still had trouble hearing it at times . Remember , I 'm not in an office cube with carpeting and noise absorbing fabric cubicle walls , but in my truck on the highway or on the plant floor . The clarity of the sound is excellent . The volume level is more than adequate for me with several levels left to crank up the volumn if I need to.The headset is bulkier than my self destructed HS850 . The recharge plug pushes in with a friction fit as opposed to Motorola 's press to unlatch type power plug ( actually its the same charger that fits many Mot phones ) that ripped the guts out of my HS850.I usually fold the Plantronics 510 into a flat configuration before droping it in my shirt pocket when Im not wearing it . Folded , its slightly bigger than my previous MOT , but its advantage of putting it on my ear with one hand and the isolating abilities of its earpiece outweigh the small size advantage of the HS850 . And the friction fit recharge plug will never rip the guts out of this BT earpiece.I found the on-off button very easy to use , unlike the comments of many others . I can very easily find the pointy button when the 510 is on my ear . Press for 3-4 seconds and it beeps to tell me its on . 2-3 seconds later a series of tones announces that it has connected with my Motorola i870 . A blue led flashes every 4 or 5 seconds when the unit is on and connected . Press and hold the pointy power button until the led glows red and it 510 turns off.Its been a great BT headset for me .	1
This headset is a replacement for a logitec I had used for years . It is my second bluetooth and the fit is great . It does not hurt the ear and stays in place very well.The noise canceling is not on par with the logitec , but I added a wind sock and it resolved most of the challenges.The audio is not as good as I would like and the controls are confusing to me . I think the former because my current phone is a 1.1 and the latter because I am use to the logitec.All in all a good value for the price .	1
This headset proved to be a very pleasant surprised after tryinga bunch of others . Was definitely the most comfortable , hadgreat sound and actually fits in your ear . Variable ear piecesare a great touch and this unit should fit larger ears better.Sound quality was very good . Only downside is slightly hardto manipulate buttons . But this is minor.If you 've tried a bunch and ca n't get a good fit , try this one , it 'll probably work - did for me .	1
I 've been using mine for about a month and I like it . The sound quality is high , both sending and receiving . It came with three ear bud covers , the smallest of which is the best fit for me . However , even that one is still a bit too large for me and I find that I occasionally need to readjust the ear piece during a conversation ( otherwise I 'd give this 5 stars ) . I find that the controls are too small for my hands , and so I do not attempt to use them while wearing the headset.All in all it 's an effective headset and an improvement over the Motorola H700 I had been using .	1
this was my 3rd one ran over one with my car and wore one out . Very good .	1
I have tried a few different bluetooth headsets , always looking for the Perfect Trifecta of ( in order of importance ) : 1 ) great audio transmission quality in loud environments , 2 ) great audio reception ( i.e . loud enough , no clicks or pops ) , and 3 ) comfort . The Plantronics 510 scores 5 stars for comfort , 5 stars for audio reception , but only 4 stars for audio transmission.To be fair , today 's bluetooth headsets will never be as clear as the handset itself , or a wired headset , because bluetooth headsets sample at 8 KHz ( i.e . 8,000 audio samples per second ) , while wired headsets and phones sample at 16 KHz ( 16,000 audio samples per second ) . That is why today 's bluetooth headsets will always sound just a bit muffled.That said , as far as bluetooth goes , the Plantronics 510 does quite well -- but it has problems . I use it with my BlackBerry 8700 . In a quiet environment , such as indoors or in a car with the windows up , audio transmission will be very clear . The boom mic brings the microphone closer to your mouth than do those tiny in-ear headsets , where the microphone is all the way up at your ear . ( The microphone is about 3 inches from my mouth , compared to in-ear microphones , which are about 6 inches away . ) The closer distance leads to a better , louder sound . However , in a noisy environment , everyone I 've talked to finds it somewhat difficult to hear me because the sensitive microphone will pick up a lot of background noise . People have complained that they can hear the beeping of the checkout counter , or all the people chatting at Starbucks , or all the traffic noise , and it 's hard to focus on what I 'm saying . When I then disconnect the headset and talk directly into the phone , they all say , `` That 's much better ! '' That said , at least people can make out what I 'm saying in a loud environment with this headset ; with other bluetooth headsets I 've used ( e.g . the Motorola HS-820 ) , loud environments render my relatively soft voice completely unintelligible.Audio reception is great when you 're close to the phone ; after about 5-10 feet away , you start to get clicks and pops . ( Also , there are a fair number of clicks if I use the headset in my right ear while keeping the BlackBerry in my left pocket ; my phone and headset need to be on the same side of my body , it seems , for the clearest sound . ) The headset is very loud , and I usually listen to callers at about half-volume.In terms of comfort , Plantronics provides three styles of earbuds : small , medium , and a triangle-shaped larger one . After trying them all , I prefer the medium-sized bud -- I can keep the headset in my ear for over an hour without any discomfort , and sometimes I forget i am wearing it . Admittedly , it took me a while to figure out how to put in on with one hand , but I soon got the hang of it . It now takes me no more than 2 seconds to put it on . ( Hint : Hold the earbud/boom-mic section with your thumb and middle finger , and lift the bulky back section up with your forefinger . Place the earbud in your ear , and then remove your forefinger and let the back section naturally fall back behind your ear . It sounds more complicated than it is , but it takes some getting used to . ) I used to complain about the small power button , but then I realized that it 's extremely easy to press down once the headset is on your ear . Contrary to popular belief , it is NOT a rocker switch ; it presses down , but if you try to power on or off while not wearing the headset , it is tricky to find the right angle at which it needs to be pressed.So , bottom line : This is the best bluetooth headset I have ever used . When I am taking business calls at home and I want to sound as clear as possible , I either talk directly into the headset or use a wired headset with a boom microphone located 1-2 inches from my mouth -- but as far as bluetooth headsets go , the Plantronics 510 is extremely convenient for use when walking about town , or driving . I am giving it four stars because it is n't PERFECT ( and I only give five-star ratings for perfection ) . That said , I will continue to use it as my daily headset until the coming of the Perfect Trifecta of audio transmission , audio reception , and comfort -- which almost certainly will be achieved by Plantronics .	1
I read a lot before buying this headset and was kind of nervous because some bad reviews I read but I must say it was worthy because this headset is really good , I can hear perfectly when using it , it does n't hurts my ear or anything , I do n't use it like everyday so the battery has last for almost a week so far . I have a samsung captivate and did n't had any problem pairing it and using it.5 stars !	1
For several years I used a Logitech Bluetooth for my cell phone , and while it worked great , it was always uncomfortable . When it snapped in two , I decided on the Voyager 510 ! Wow , not only does it work great , but it is VERY , VERY COMFORTABLE ! In fact , I can honestly say I actually forget that I am wearing it , something I can not say about my previous device . So for all of you thinking of a headset , you can not go wrong with this one ! Five stars !	1
The Voyager 510 is very comfortable to wear and was easy to setup . The speaker volume is good with little or no static . Plus the it does n't look like a block of plastic hanging off your ear . I highly recommend this headset .	1
Over the last 2 years , I have tried over 10 different models of bluetooth headsets from different manufacturers . By far , Voyager 510 has the best all around performance - clarity , loudness , battery standby time , pairing , static free , ... If I have to pick one negative thing to say it would be the size . It is quite a bit bigger than some other competing products but it is a small prize to pay for its superb performance.Get one , you 'll be glad that you do .	1
I 've tried several different Bluetooth headsets from Motorola and Cardo , and ended up returning or giving away all of them . I kept the Plantronics 510 because it is simply the best I have ever tried . I hear no static , cracks or pops , the audio quality is tops both for me and the caller , and it 's comfortable and does n't flop around on my ear like other headsets do when I move.While the Plantronics may seem slightly larger than other headsets ( mainly because it has a larger part that goes behind the ear ) , it is very comfortable to wear and use , and is very light . It slips into a pocket or bag just as easily as any other Bluetooth headset.The Plantronics 510 comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds to fit your ear perfectly and the speaker goes in ( or very close to ) your ear , unlike other headsets where the speaker just rests on the outside of your ear which is really not good for getting high volume in windy/noisy environments . Also the Plantronics has a boom mic that folds down partway towards your mouth . This is way better than headsets where the mic is way up by your ear because the closer the mic is to your mouth , the better you will sound and the less background noise the callers will hear . Everyone I 've talked to using this Plantronics have raved at how good I sound , especially compared to the crappy Motorola 's I 've tried previously.The Voyager 510 has great battery life both while talking and on standby . The Bluetooth range is superb-I can very effectively walk all around my condo from room to room , talking on the phone , yet my cellphone remains on my computer desk-it really goes 30 feet , and through walls too . And the fact that this headset can even remember pairing with multiple devices is icing on the cake.I really recommend this headset . It 's money well spent . Or go ahead and try others , but it would be my educated guess that you will end up with this one eventually , like I did . *There is a slightly misleading bit of text in the instruction manual with regards to charging that you should be aware of : It states that the LED will illuminate Red while charging and illuminate Blue when done charging . However it actually blinks red while charging and turns solid Blue when complete .	1
Tried many , but this one is only one I can use while driving noisy truck .	1
It does well in the car and has good range . It can reach my phone from everywhere in the house and can reach amazingly far at work . Good thing because the are some cell dead zones at work . The cell can stay where the reception is good.It sounds a little hollow though . Folks can tell when I 'm hands free .	1
I 've been using this headset for about two weeks with a Blackberry 8700C . The headset has a very comfortable fit and the volume is nice and loud . The downside is that the battery life seems a bit sub-standard . I have been caught several times using it and running out of batteries . I also have some random disconnects with my Blackberry . Tough to say whether these disconnects are phone or headset related . I think this is a great value for the money though and prefer it over the Motorola 's and Jabra 's ( better fit , louder sound ) . There is some difficulty pressing the buttons on this headset too - nothing that I could not work around though .	1
We have three identical phones and three different bluetooth headsets . A Plantronics Explorer 320 , a Motorola H350 , and this Plantronics Voyager 510 . Of the three , the Plantronics are superior in comfort and sound quality , and the 510 is outstanding in both respects . Although a little bulkier than the others , it is much more comfortable and my callers and I actually feel it sounds better than using the handset . As a result , I do n't use the handset unless I have to !	1
On the strength of the very high rating and huge reviewer feedback here on Amazon , I bought this Bluetooth device -- my first bluetooth headset ever . I finally have a phone that has Bluetooth capability , and I was keenly interested in a wireless headset that would n't have the cord tangle issues of corded headsets.This device does exactly what I wanted it to do . It was a piece of cake to setup on my Verizon Samsung u540 phone . You would n't even need to crack open the user manual except to discover the 4-digit code you have to plug-in to your phone ( it 's 0000 , btw ) . After that , it 's a snap to turn on and link to my phone.My other important concern was voice clarity , both on sending and receiving . Thus far , after several hours of use , I can tell you that the voice reception I hear is crystal clear . No crackling , no hollowing or echoing . On the other end , I 've not had anyone complain about being unable to hear my voice or that my voice is coming across muddled -- interestingly , I 've had such complaints while using my old , corded headset ! The power button *is* small and it *is* a tad more difficult to depress than you might want , but then , you wo n't accidentally turn on or turn off this device because of the way it 's designed . I agree with others -- turn on the device before putting it on your ear , and do the same when you 're turning it off.As for noise canceling , my wife and I tested out this device in very noisy home with four small kids , and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this headset communicated my voice but not the ambient noise in the room.Using the volume control on the headset was pretty easy to do . Note that you can control voice volume either through the phone handset volume control or the control on this Plantronics headset . If other reviewers are complaining about low volume from this headset , it 's likely because one of the two volume controls is turned down too low , or perhaps the mobile phone their using does n't have much by way of signal output . This Plantronics headset has *plenty* of loud volume if that 's what you want.As for ear comfort , I found it to be very comfortable , although I have n't worn it all day long . I talked to a friend for an hour yesterday , and I had absolutely no discomfort at all . The device comes with three earpieces ( small , medium and large ) . I use the medium with great results.The phone fits snuggly on my ear and it does n't move around at all , although I 'm not jogging or even walking much while using it.I like the more discreet look of having the `` guts '' of this device behind my ear , with a thin microphone on the side of my face , rather than the fat Motorola designs.Other reviewers have cautioned about the headset breaking , so I just take very gentle care while handling it . I suspect I wo n't have a problem with it falling apart.I ca n't speak to battery life , because after a lengthy phone call , I just recharge it so it 's ready for the next call I might make . Charging it is easy to do and does n't take long , either.In sum , I 'm very satisfied with this device . As long as it does n't break , it 's performance and comfortable design make this an excellent choice .	1
it is just what we expected . Very nice and confortable to use.The only problems they have is that they get a bit hot when you talk , but in general they are very good Cel Phones . These days you can not getnew flip phone models , so this is one of the best left before the dissapear for good .	1
I bought this RAZR v3 phone in July to go with my 7-Eleven Speak Out Wireless prepaid service . The phone I received from Amazon.com was made for the Hong Kong market , so it came with a outlet plug adapter for U.S. customers . ( The AC adapter itself is universal voltage , and the slim paper manual is in English . ) The phone is quadband and fully unlocked , so it can be used anywhere in the world.I really like the RAZR phone . It 's very solid and the voice quality is excellent . Speak Out Wireless runs on AT & T ; and T-Mobile networks so the reception quality can vary , but overall the RAZR does an excellent job in pulling in as much signal as possible . As with other Moto phones , the brightness of the screen can be adjusted , and the ringer type and volume can be easily changed . The metallic keypad takes a little getting used to , but is pretty comfy to use.The camera is only VGA but takes good-quality pictures when there 's plenty of light . Video capture is jerky and limited to 15 seconds , so that 's probably the weakest feature for me . Bluetooth linkup to a Sony Ericsson earpiece works fine . Battery life is admirable ; I do n't use the phone much , maybe just 10 minutes a week , and I need to recharge it once every 8 days or so.Because I 've owned many Moto 's before so I like the RAZR 's interface , since it feels familiar , but I can understand how it can confuse users new to the Moto scene . Overall , though , I do n't think it 's harder to use than a Sony or Nokia.What really impresses me is the build quality of this phone . Nowhere can you find out where this thing is made , but the material and fit and finish are excellent . I 'm very happy with this inexpensive purchase .	1
i bought this to replace a cingular phone and works well . package came with a europe charger and a cheap plug adapter , but had the manuals and everything seemed legitimate . box was n't sealed and think the product was manufactured in 2005 but again , everything works well.i miss the nokia UI but battery time is okay and reception seems fine . have n't been able to find a driver for vista yet so have n't been able to charge via usb.i would buy this unlocked phone again .	1
I have been with this RAZR for a few days , but it has been working great . Setup is really easy . It has good reception , feels sturdy , and price from Amazon was really good . I have read here some complains regarding the inability to connect to Internet . it does connect to Internet , but you have to ask your carrier for the browser settings , and set it in your phone . Unlocked phones rules ! ! !	1
I thought to come write this review because it is the 2 year anniversary of me buying this phone . I have never had any protective cover or case on it and it is still not very scratched up and it works as perfectly as when I got it . I had to replace the battery at 18 months but it cost $ 10 with shipping online for a genuine Motorola battery . Every other cell phone I have had has broken in some way long before 2 years . I 'm amazed it is still in such great cosmetic and mechanical shape . No reason for me to get a new phone anytime soon .	1
This is my fourth consecutive Motorola phone . I 've owned a Timeport , v66 , and v600 . The Timeport was simply terrible . The v66 was a little better , but the Motorola menu had to be the worst of any phone I had ever used . My v600 was a very pleasant surprise . My sleek and functional RAZR is the best phone that I have owned . I really like the large crisp screen . The tiny external screen is a great addition . After three weeks of fairly heavy use , I have n't had any problems . The RAZR has pretty good talk time , but I 'm not certain whether or not one can really get the 7 hours claimed by Motorola . The feature that I really like and appreciate is the abilit to charge my phone with a standard USB cable . It 's nice not having to carry around an extra charger when I 'm already lugging around my laptop and its power supply .	1
Best cellphone ... .of course , keeping distance between our age , but i feel this product was revolutionary at his time ; light and easy to use	1
Well after my free phone from cingular broke I was stuck , they were not able to offer me any kind of deal until my 2 year contract was up . I really wanted a razr so I went looking . This was the cheapest one I could find so I went for it . It came with the euro charger , but it had a small adpater that made it fit the american outlets .	1
The original wall charger I had was hit and miss pertaining to actually charging my Razor phone . This works like a charm and gets the battery charged up to maximum capacity .	1
Since I spend a lot of time for travling in my life , this item is good for me to charge my cell phone whenever i go . It markes great for travel because this item is much smaller than the version that came with the Razr .	1
Good company and staff took care of a problem in a quick manner and e-mail me right away ! Would Buy from here again !	1
I love the price of this charger ! It works perfectly.It looks exactly like the original.I have been using it for less than a week , but I do n't anticipate any problems.If I have to update on a issue , I will ! Try this before buying one from the manufacturer !	1
Looks like genuine Motorola charger , just like the original one that came with the phone . Well built and the original one is still kicking after 3-4 years . Just needed extra one .	1
Inexpensive and gets the job done . Small and light weight . Ca n't been the price with free shipping .	1
This is the same charger that came with the RAZR V3 phone . light , compact , charges the phone .	1
This charger is full 850mA , unlike others advertised here that are only 500 . Due to that , it charged all of my USB devices perfectly , especially the ones that do n't charge unless it is that high of a power rating .	1
WOW THIS WENT TO MY FLIP RAZOR IT WORKED REALLY WELL AND THEN SMARTPHONES STARTED COMMING OUT AND I HAD TO KEEP UP BUT IT WAS A GREAT CHARGER I THINK I STILL HAVE IT AND USE IT FOR MY MP3 PLAYER	1
I ordered this charger as a travel companion , so I did n't always have to pack my original charger . It 's been wonderful having one I can just leave at home and one that travels with me . I 've had no problems with this charger at all . Be aware that this is a MINI-USB connector , and while it will charge my newer smart phones , it requires a Mini to Micro -USB adapter ... and is not as fast as the new chargers . But it does just fine for an over-night charging from less than 10 % to fully-charged .	1
worked wonderfully with the cellular phones . the charger seemed to charge the phones quickly , never ran hot like prior charger .	1
this is a genuine motorola charger . Got this charger to have a spare at work for my KRZR . not quite the same intensity as the original one , so it will take some more time than usual to fully charge your phone . not really a problem for me anyway . this item was super cheap and the delivery rather quick .	1
Just a simple home charger for Motorola mini-USB type phones . Works just fine . Not much else to say . Good bye .	1
This item is a Motorola branded charger that works on my Razr , and I am very happy with the price and delivery . I took off one star because the description says `` Motorola Retail Packaging '' , but mine came in a small plastic bag with no retail packaging at all .	1
I bought 2 of these for our Motorola 3xx 's because we bought a new RV and it is so easy to forget your phone charger at home so I decided to buy these and just leave them in the RV !	1
These are some decent headphones , but if you use them they WILL break . It 's only a matter of time . I did some research and found the following tips to prevent/fix the breaking : Solution # 1 : Put the band portion of the headphones in boiling water for a while and slowly spread them open . Once you have them opened up some take them out of the water and let them cool while holding them in the spread position . This reduces the tension of the headphones against your ears and reduces the stress put on the headphone band . This results in two advantages , less pressure on your ears resulting in better comfort and no cracking of the band.If you stretch them to far they will fit too loose and will lose some of there bass effect . But all you have to do is reheat them and close them up a little until you get the fit you want.Solution # 2 : Even if your headband has broken in two this will still work . It will only take a little patience and $ 5.00 of materials from a local hobby shop.Materials : - 3/4 inch or 1 inch nylon tape ( all hobby stores that have RC Plane materials have this ) - CA ( cyanoacrylate ) the stuff that superglue is made of but I recommend getting some real CA at any hobbystore . Get the `` thin '' stuff.- Saran Wrap . yes the sandwich stuff ... - ScissorsSide note : I call the nylon tape `` tape '' , but it is really just a ribbon of nylon . There is no sticky stuff on the `` tape '' 1 ) First if your headset has snapped completely in two use a little CA to mend it as best as you can . It doesnt need to be perfect but just mended enough that it is technically one piece again and headphones are seperated to where you want them to be.2 ) Next cut off a 6 inch piece of the nylon tape and using a VERY small amount of CA , tack the top edge of the tape to the BACK of the band where the crack has occured ( which should be exactly in the middle of the band in most cases ) . Use just enough so it sticks as you do n't want too much CA getting into the ribbon . It should be hanging down now in the back like a tail . Note : Use the saran wrap to help hold the tape in place as you are tacking it in place as you DO NOT want this stuff to get on your fingers ... 3 ) Once the CA has dried enough and the tape is stuck , wrap the tape under and around the band one time until the tape is hanging down again in the back . Pull the tape VERY tight and use a little bit of CA at the top to keep it in place.4 ) Wrap around one more time and tack it again one more time making sure to always keep the tape tight when you tack it . You should have wrapped the tape around twice at this point . If your set was broken completely in two you may want to wrap one or two more times and at a slight angle to cover a little more area . When done , use some scissors to cut off the excess tape at a point so the cut end of the tape is at the back.5 ) Now you can saturate the whole band of tape with CA . Use the saran wrap to press down the cut end of the tape as you glue and it will end up perfectly flat . This is an incredibly strong fiberglass patch similar to carbon fiber . The patch will have a very small profile ( not that thick ) and be similar in color to scotch tape , however it could easily be painted to match the color of the headband if desired.There you have it . This is a permanent and SOLID fix and only takes about 5 minutes . I 'm wearing mine right now after i just fixed them . Also you can do this ( and I strongly suggest you do ) to a set that has not cracked yet , because they WILL NOT CRACK if you do . Just do it exactly in the middle of the band .	1
I purchased this unit a few weeks ago from one of Amazon 's 3rd party vendors . I got a very good deal , but the trade-off was that it came in a bag with no instructions . I went to the Logitech website and got things going.The pros:1 ) No wires , and the batteries last about 7 hours ( I tried using them all day at work ) 2 ) The sound is good enough . ( I had been using a Shure e3 , which finally broke for good out of warranty ) . This unit is not near as loud or as bassy as the Shure , but they do n't fall off while I 'm on the treadmill either.3 ) Worked well for watching TV in private.The cons:1 ) Seems to need it 's own bluetooth transmitter . My Powerbook bluetooth connected but the sound was so scratchy and bad that it was unusuable . Plug in the supplied transmitter and everything was fine.2 ) The headband is not adjustable and my ear feels bruised after wearing them for an hour . The time I wore them all day at work wo n't be repeated.The headband is almost a dealbreaker . If it was n't for that , I 'd be using these headphones all the time.3 ) The unit is kind of like those watches that use one button for multiple purposes . The button on each part does something different depending on how long you hold down the button . After a couple of days I got the hang of of , but the button on the transmitter is so small , that I have to stop doing anything but holding the button down to turn it off.Overall , I 'd say wireless on a treadmill is worth the ear bruising . I ca n't count how many times I 've accidentally hit the cord with my arm and sent my iPod flying across the room . I like to watch videos on it while on the treadmill and the bluetooth headphones make that a pleasant experience instead of constantly trying to watch the cord . People with larger heads need to know in advance that these will be tight on your ears .	1
I have both grey and black version nowthe sound is good , but it 's kinda too tight like the grey oneI applied the reinforcement ( cut a strip from plastic card , use Krazy glue to stick the plastic strip on the middle of headband , and use nylon packing tape to wrap ) , this 'll affect the looking , but durability is more importantI repaired 4 of them for same cracking/breaking from other users , and used same method , and brought all of them back to servicethe sound of the headphones is good ( pretty balanced on all frequency ) , I connect it directly to my pda ( Dell X51v and T-Mobile MDA ) and laptop without supplied audio adaptor , but I found the RF of the headphones is kinda weak , that I only get half of the range compared with moto HT820 and plantronics 590a ( pairing passcode : 0000 , bt a2dp support required ) the audio adaptor is used with logiteches ONLY , will not work with other brands ( even the passcode is 0000 ) if you know how to apply reinforcement to prevent headband breaking , the price is a steal now1st edit : this headphones DOES NOT support AVRCP ( play/pause , prev , next ) , if you plan to use it on your laptop without audio adaptor , get the one for ipod ( grey ) instead	1
This Bluetooth 1.2 version has since been replaced by the newer generation , but the price of this model has come down by nearly $ 80 as a result . I 've used them for working out in front of a TV ( if you equip your set with an inexpensive 3.5 mm audio out jack ) , listening to iPod , portable dvd player in the car , and computer . Pros : The sound is quite clear and true , provided you are n't an overly demanding audiophile . The single charger has a Y-shaped adapter end permitting charging of both the adapter and headset simultaneously . Cons : they are considerably heavier than corded headphones and become a bit uncomfortable after an hour .	1
My husband likes it I do n't even know what it is but I can say my husband was glad to get it and he uses it on something here .	1
GOOD PRICE AND IT WORKS FINE SO FAR . I ALWAYS CAN USE EXTRA CORDS FOR MY CELL PHONE YA KNOW THANK YOU AMAZON ...	1
Exactly as described , works perfect using it on my pc or my charger . Could n't have been any better for my motorola .	1
Bought a few to have strategically placed around the house , cars , work , and in my briefcase and luggage packing so that I do not have to hunt for a cable .	1
If you need an additional charging cord for your cell phone with a mini usb male plug this works very well . Newer phones use the more narrow usb plug so make certain you understand which version you are requesting . Well made and durable and the price is right .	1
I bought this usb data cable after losing the USB cable for charging my Kinivo Headphones , and this cable works well with them . So far , I have n't had any problems when charging my headphones with this cable .	1
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC . Works with my Fuji digital camera and my RAZR V3m . I bought it for the RAZR and it works great . A whole lot cheaper than what cellular stores want for these .	1
If yah ave the correct driver on your PC you can USB charge your phone	1
This is not the cable pictured and described , I subtracted one star for accuracy because when ordering through Amazon the picture and description are the objective pieces of information available when deciding to make a purchase . Reviews are subjective and open to interpretation so the star I subtracted is for the inaccuracies in the photo and description of this product not the product 's performance.I ordered and received a USB Data cable with no recognizible brand name although the box is labelled USB Data Cable Mobile Accessories and has a logo that reads Certified Hi-Speed USB . There was no Morotola name/logo on the box , software CD or cable itself ; every other Motorola phone accessory I have purchased has their name and logo displayed prominently on the package and stamped into the accessory.That being said this product works great and it does what I need it to do . I plugged it in and had no problems using it with my Razr V3 . So although the authenticity of this product was ultimately not an issue for me , it may be for someone else who is considering this product.As mentioned above it came with software although I have XP and Motorola Phone Tools by Avanquest and it works fine with this combination of operating system and software.So in short the cable , while not the one pictured or a Motorola product , works and the price was right .	1
I just recieved my Treo 650 four days ago and am happy so far . I bought it just to be an organizer , phone , mp3 player -- in that order -- so I ca n't speak to other features such as web access ( currently an expensive $ 45 from Verizon ) .Two pieces of advice:1 . Budget several hours to set up . It 's nearly like buying a new computer . I had to transfer my calendar and contacts from my old Cli & eacute ; and found that some of my old Palm applications caused the Treo to restart ( I promptly deleted them ) . Generally it was just tedious software stuff , including a tricky firmware update from the Palm website , but do n't expect to be ready out the door.2 . Before you buy , budget for accessories . After purchasing the following : case ( $ 20 ) , SD card reader ( $ 10 ; for the easiest transfer of files to the SD card ) , 2GB SD card ( $ 150 ) , 2.5MM-compatible headphones ( $ 17 ) , 2.5MM > 3.5MM headphone adapter ( $ 10 ) , extra sync cable ( $ 13 ) , mp3 player application ( $ 15 ; the RealPlayer is clunky and does n't have a graphic equalizer ) , I have nearly spent as much as the device itself ! Assuming the Treo gives me years of service , It 'll be worth it but I 'm going to have to live with the fear that the accessories will not be useful for my next smartphone ( I rarely have replaced my cell phones because they got too old , it 's normally because they stop working ) .	1
The Treo 650 is a great device . It combines cellular phone , PDA , and wireless functionality , allowing you to check e-mail , surf the web , make phone calls , and keep your contacts and calendar.Be sure to buy an aftermarket USB cable , which will allow you to charge and sync your treo 650 at the same time and a headset adaptor.By downloading a few aftermarket applications ( do a search on google ) , you can make it play internet radio , play MP3 's from a 1GB SD card , play some great games , and even use it to access the internet from your laptop while on the road . Here 's what I use:1 . Directory Assistant ( by Rick Whitt ) - This program allows you to easily look up and dial busines and residential telephone numbers and get driving directions and maps , without waiting as various web pages load . I know it sounds like a silly app , and I thought so too , but I now use it all the time to avoid dialing 411 and paying $ 1.25 per call . Best of all , its free ( but you can and should make a donation ) .2 . Atom Smash by Red Mercury Software- a great arkanoid style game.3 . BackupBuddy VFS by Blue Nomad - back up the apps on your Treo.4 . Blocks by Electron Hut - free Tetris Clone5 . ChitChat Lite - a free MSN Messenger client6 . Froggy by Tim Smith - Frogger clone.7 . Galax by Tim Smith - Galaxian clone.8 , PacMan by Horaco Ho - Duh.9 . Pocket Tunes by NormSoft - great MP3 and internet radio player . Much better control over the audio than the included real player ( which only plays MP3s , not internet radio ) .10 . PDANet by June Fabrics - Allows you to connect your laptop to your Treo and use the internet . Works great.11 . FileZ by Nosleep software - your basic file manager for the Palm OS.12 . Voice Dial - download - dial calls using the sound of your voice . Free to say numbers , but must buy to dial by name.13 . Pocket DVD Studio - allows you to compress DVD movies so that they can fit on a SD Card , making your Treo a movie player .	1
I agree with the other poster . Why blame the phone because you broke the screen . Is the monitor at home bad because you dropped it off the table . The phone is the best smart phone out there . People have had issues with resets , but that is more of a conflict with the many apps that you can load on it and usually can be solved . I love this phone . Also ... do not rate 1 star and then say the phone is good , but verizon is bad . That is unfair since it lowers the over all rating . Ignore the guy who broke his phone ... this is a very good phone .	1
This is my first `` smart phone '' so I ca n't compare this to previous models . However , I can tell you that it is great for what I need:1 . Great wireless service coverage . Verizon has the best coverage of any provider . I even have a signal in elevators and stairwells.2 . Text messaging . My job requires me to carry a pager . With this phone , I have forwarded my pager . Now I only carry one device . It is great for responding to pages or initiating message dialog . I have 1,000 messages on my plan , and that should be plenty . It is very handy to be in meetings and be able to ping people back at their desk for information.3 . Organizer . I installed the software on my PC at work , and now my Outlook calendar is available wherever I take my phone . One thing I did n't like was the lack of options on the initial sync . I wound up with all of my `` Frequent Contacts '' from Outlook on my phone - this includes anyone I had ever sent an e-mail to . Luckily , it is easy to filer on these contacts and delete them . Be sure to set device overrides desktop on contacts.I do n't use the web or e-mail pieces because the data package is too expensive ( ~ $ 45/mo ) . Unless you need to send and receive attachments , SMS is sufficient for e-mail . Most web queries can be done over SMS to services like Google provides.Overall it 's great !	1
I just purchased the Treo 650 with AllTel ( not specified here on Amazon ) and have loved it . It took me a couple days to get used to the feel of the bulkier PDA phone compared to my smaller LG , but once I got into it , I love it . The only complaints I would have are that it does not come with a docking station ( must be purchased separately ) and the only way to make it a `` great '' phone from a `` good '' phone is to add close to $ 100 worth of various 3rd party software . While it 's a lot of money to bring it up to speed , the flexibility and having options are nice . Nothing 's perfect , but so far , so good ( and AllTel has a 30day money back guarantee or exchange deal , so nothing 's lost here ) .	1
BRIEFLY : This inexpensive wire allows for easy transfer of media files - photos , DRM-free music , videos , etc . between a Sony Ericsson phone and any computer that has a USB port.It is very useful for phone users such as myself who are only interested in a 'phone calls only ' plan and are not willing to pay the phone company some extra monthly charge for Internet service.It is needed because the Sony Ericsson phones do NOT support a standard USB interface so a 'normal ' USB cable will not work._______________________________________EXTENDED DISCUSSION : I 'm not surprised my wife 's Sony Ericsson 's TM506 came without a USB interface wire . It was a 'free ' phone and the phone company wished they could nickel and dime us forever through their 'plans ' and and make us pay various monthly service fees for the privilege of downloading a couple of songs or uploading photos or videos we made using the phone 's camera . The Sony Ericsson 's phones lacking a standard USB interface is probably intimidating enough to persuade most users to succumb to the phone company 's demand of an extra $ 10 or more per month for 'web ' access . But it does not need to be this way.Since we only wanted a phone that made phone calls this inexpensive wire allows us to squeeze some extra functionality off our free phone by allowing us to transfer media files in and out of the phone by connecting it to a computer . It 's easy , it requires no software installation and we do n't need to pay one extra dime to the phone company for the privilege.Positives : - eliminates the need to pay the phone company for an Internet connection- no software installation required- file transfer is actually faster- allows for easy media files transfer to and from OUR computer - all DRM-free files can be easily send to the phone- even users who have an Internet plan may appreciate the ability to connect their phone directly to their computerConcerns : - some minimal computer skills are expected - such as the ability to recognize specific file types and copy or move them to/from specific foldersConclusion : recommended to any Sony Ericsson phone user , with or without a media or Internet plan .	1
You can use this to charge your phone with your laptop/pc . Also you can use this to debrand or add pics , music , or apps from your computer to phone.. works great .	1
I was surprised how quickly I received it . I was a little hesitant when I opened the package because it was in a small zip lock bag , no manufacturer brand packaging . But I tried it out and it works great and just as the OEM models . I would recommend it . Also , perfectly priced !	1
It is hard to write A review on a cable . It works and does what it is supposed to do ,	1
This is a SonY OEM cable . It is good quality cable . This cable will last a lot longer that some of the generic cables that I have gotten in the past .	1
no special installs necessary . with this cable , my sony ericsson w3001 just showed up on my windows xp system as another drive . works great . too cool .	1
Needed USB connector for an old Sony Ericsson W518a - works great ! PC sees the phone when connected with no problem !	1
Im very pleased with this little charger . The blue light indicates whether or not it 's on , and my phone charges very fast . Five minutes and it 's three quarters charged from bring dead ! Would definitely recommend this to someone else .	1
needed a power source with a mini usb . This is exactly what I needed . It was also delivered very fast . I use this to power a RCA to HDMI converter for a Roku 3 .	1
Yea , basically . It 's a phone charger for the Motorola Razor , and guess what ? It works for it . Also works for a few other phones .	1
The charger did come in and does charge my mp3 players like it 's supposed to . The shipping was longer than what I paid for . However I thought the charger was a disconnected charger to where the cable could come off the base and connect to a computer so I 'll have to order another charger that does what I need it to do .	1
It charged my phone . Actually , I bought six of these so it would be more correct to say that & # 34 ; they & # 34 ; charged my phone.Why would I get six ? One for the bedroom , one for the kitchen , one for the living room , one for the home office , one for the car , and one for work . My phone is full of electricity , I 'll tell you that .	1
I was incredibly frustrated to have purchased this product to find out that it does not work to charge up a phone that I specifically bought it for . It was a Christmas present for someone that had relied on a car charger for years . She 'd plug it into her car outlet and let it sit in her car until it was charged . I assumed I just solved her problem . Unfortunately , her Motorola Razr is such a dinosaur , I 'd have to special order it from the actual manufacturer.Here 's the surprise part ... ... I just moved and finally found my Kindle . It 's the Kindle touch , nothing special ( not the fire or paperwhite ) . It 's simply a black and white touch screen . Unfortunately , I could n't find the charger , no matter where I looked ! Even so , the charger that came with the Kindle would take about 2-3 hours to fully charge , when it 's nearly dead . So , I decided to try this on my Kindle to see if it would fit . To my surprise , it fits just like a glove ! Not only that , but it also charged my Kindle in under an hour . It was so dead , it refused to turn on until I plugged it in to a charger . Still , it was fully charged within an hour . Go figure !	1
Tried to find a new one for my girls dad 's house , they just started using my old razor phone . Works good .	1
The only complaint I have is that this ear piece does n't adjust to the inside of your ear . The rubber piece is the only thing that you can adjust to position it to direct it to the inside of your ear . But for the money ... ..you ca n't complain .	1
Love this compact headset . Fits well on my ear , very comfortable . Mic picks up well , clear voice coming through . Very pleased with this purchase going to get some spares for sure . Feels like a solid build so should be durable .	1
Today I received the Jabra C250 and the Jabra C500 headsets . The C500 is better designed for use with cellular phones but the sound quality in the ear piece and microphone is not as tood at the C250 . The person I called compared the two devices and said the C250 was like AT & T wireless voice quality ( talking in a tunnel ) . The C250 was also a bit more comfortable in my ear . All things considered I would buy another .	1
I 've been using this headset ( although mine does n't have the call answer button like this version does ) for a few years now . It 's the first headset I 've ever used that was comfortable and had great sound quality in both directions , and I 've used it with 3 different phones over the years all with the same results . I hear people perfectly and I 've never had a single comment much less a complaint about the sound quality from other people . It comes with two different size gels for your ear , and a spare of each so you 're totally set . Depending on the shape of your ear you may prefer one or the other of the ear gels.This headset is so comfortable I can wear it on my ear for hours at a time without it bothering me , and it stays snugly against my cheek and does n't flop around in the slightest . I do n't know why it has gotten some bad reviews on this site , on other sites it averages at least 4 stars with many , many reviews . Bottom line , I 'd gladly pay 2 or 3 times what Amazon is charging for this headset , especially now that it has an answer call/end button on it .	1
I love these , have bought other brands and they break in a few months . These last and are a good product .	1
This earboom works a little better than most . Decent sturdy construction as well . I will buy another when it wears out .	1
I highly recommend this for anyone using a cordless home phone . While I am a fan of bluetooth , this seems to be easiest for use around the house .	1
It 's amazing the sound quality considering that when you have this thing over your ear , the `` mouth '' piece is a lot closer to your ear than it is to your mouth . I made a call right after I bought it and the person on the other end could not tell I was using a hands free device.Like all Jabra hands-free ear gizmos , this one comes with a variety of gel-like ear inserts for different shaped ears and for those who want to use the gizmo on their left ears instead of the right.My less than perfect rating is the less-than flexible adjustment for the piece that goes around the ear . It 's a snug fit , to be sure , but a little too snug . After a recent lengthy phone call , my ear was so fatigued from being squeezed for so long , it gave me a headache . There is no way to take the snug tension down a notch . I have normal size ears , not circus ears , so I 'm not just complaining for the sake of it.The gel-like insert feels great - but it 's the over-the-ear gizmo that is doing the pinching . It 's almost like wearing 4lb clasp earrings or something . It really takes two hands to put this thing on , too.The quality in hearing conversations is also excellent . There is the most subtle of echoes in both receiving and sending , but it is barely detectable . My phone has an excellent hands-free speaker built-in , but a hands-free device is essential when you want privacy and do n't want to hold your phone up to your ear for an hour .	1
I had the worry that the headset would not work with my SamsungT619 , since the latter is not on the compatibility list . On the other hand , I 've heard that all bluetooth devices with same standard ( i.e . version 1.2 ) should have no compatibility problem . It turned out to be absolutely smooth when connecting to my Samsung . The headset can flash and even vibrate when call 's coming.The headset is amazingly light weight . You ca n't even imagine a lithium battery is sitting in such a leather-weight body that can hold on for 7 hours ' talking.I spent $ 10 on this headset and could n't be more happy .	1
Your first question is what other headsets am I comparing this to . See my reviews of the Motorola HS850 , Jabra BT250v , Plantronics 320 Explorer for reference . Now let 's consider this headset in terms of the four key performance categories : pairing , sound quality , ease of use , and comfort.Pairing - I was able to pair this headset with my LG VX-9800 on the first try . The instructions in the manual are straightforward so I will not repeat them hear . The experience is similar to what I had with the BT250v.Sound Quality - This is really the top area to question with a headset . I 'm happy to report that this headset delivers nicely in this area . I am able to use less than the max volume setting in most cases which is definite progress over the other headsets I have used . On the other end , it is important that you do n't have the volume louder than you need it because otherwise people hear an echo of themselves due to the close proximity of the speaker to the microphone . However , I have found the echo to be less of an issue than it is on the HS850.Ease of Use - The key to a Jabra headset is holding the multifunction button down until it flashes . This turns the headset on and off after pairing . You will hear reports of people winding up redialing the last number called when trying to turn the headset off . If you do n't wait for the flash , this will happen . I 've also heard this reported during pairing , but that should n't be the case because you start pairing with the headset turned off . Finally , the volume buttons are easy to use . I only use the headset on my right ear so I ca n't speak to what it is like when the headset is flipped over and the buttons are on top.Comfort - I also found this headset to be the clear winner in the area over the other three that I have used . I wear glasses so the over the ear hook is a necessity . I think that they have also hit the sweet spot on placement of the speaker . The speaker is raised from the surface of the headset as opposed to the HS850 which is flush with the main body of the headset . However , it does not go into your ear like the BT250v or the Plantronics 320 . I guess another way to put it is it rests just outside of the ear canal so the speaker is as close to being inside your ear without actually being so . I think that this maximizes comfort and contributes to the better sound quality . Finally , the vibrate feature is very disturbing if you are not used to it . Do n't let that stop you though because it is something that you can turn off if you so desire .	1
I am using the Jabra BT350 with a Sony Ericsson K750i . This works like a charm . It took a while to set up ( problems with resetting my phone ) , but once I synced the two devices , I have not had any problems . The sound quality is superb , and the functions are outstanding . They include vibrating alert ( I 've turned it off ) , call accept and call decline ( much needed ) . It also allows you the opportunity to automatically call the last number dialed . The voice dialing also works great . I was not able to record the name through the BT350 , but once recorded , the phone recognized the name when spoken through the BT350 . An addition , the battery life is great . I have not had to recharge it in a while . All and all , this is a great choice for a `` handsfree '' set to be used with a mobile phone .	1
It works great ! The only issue for me is that the volume can not go up very high . This is my first bluetooth , so I ca n't compare it with others . Maybe all bluetooths have a pretty low maximum volume . Reception and battery life are great !	1
This headset fits so comfortably on my ear and I especially like that I can use either ear . I can hear so much better with the Jabra than the expensive Motorola headset I had that was always falling off my ear . In fact I was using the Motorola talking with my son , in a lot of pain and needing help . When I turned my head , it fell off and out of reach . My son called an ambulance when he could no longer hear me . My elderly Mom says she can hear me better on this headset too.Spring 2007 and this item stopped working . I 'm irritated that it did n't last longer .	1
Very comfortable to wear , good reception , price of ~ $ 22 plus shipping was unreal . I prefer this style over the Star Trek earpieces , but this one 's boom mic extends further out from the ear than other models in this series .	1
I 've been comparing 8 different headsets . The Jabra BT500 and the Plantronics Voyager 510 are both at the top . ( I also liked the Samsung WEP200 but it 's a different style so I wo n't compare it here ) I work in a noisy construction environment and drive a noisy construction van so background noise is a huge issue . Plus I need the headset to stay put even when I 'm lying on the ground , sideways , etc . This over and behind the ear style works well for me . I tested all 8 headsets by pairing two at a time and putting one in each ear , then switching between them while on the same call . This let me and the caller compare the sound quality equally from both sides of the call . In a nutshell , the Jabra BT500 wins on function and the Plantronics 510 wins on sound quality . Given that background noise is such a big issue for me , I have to go with the 510 . The BT500 has better designed buttons that both feel and work better . But , the sound problems are : 1 ) The BT500 always sounds slightly more muffled , even in a quiet environment 2 ) The BT500 has the mic so close to your face that it often touches and makes noise , especially when trying to use a button and 3 ) in a noisy environment the Plantronics 510 wins hands down . With the kind of background noise I get , I could n't use the Jabra BT500 . I have to go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 and all the other issues have to take a back seat to the sound . For those that would use this in a quiet environment I can say that the sound quality is only slightly worse than the 510 and may not outweigh the better function of the BT500 .	1
I had a motorola Bluetooth headset . I felt like Lt. Uhura with a giant ear piece in StarTrek . I had a hard time keepig it in and after 20 mintues it hurt my ear . It came with my accessory kit in one box with the car charger and case so I just used it and grumbled . But when my toddler flushed it I got the Jabra as a replacement.I love it ! It works and stays in my ear , feels comfortable even after 3-4hours in my ear . I use it only when I drive and I have used the voice dial and it works perfectly . I set the voice commands using the headset and it works . When I set them without using the headset it did not work well.Great little device .	1
I think just about every pat of this phone has already been written about . This is a great phone with a pretty intuitive interface ( though , that does n't go for the Verizon version from what I 've seen ) . The one downside is that call volume could stand to be louder , especially if one is in a crowded area . A bluetooth headset effectively eliminates this problem.Speaking of bluetooth , I was supremely impressed by how open Cingular left the bluetooth options ( again , the Verizon interface differs in this respect ) . You 're able to transfer any wallpaper , ringtones , and videos on and off with ease.The only hurdle is pairing the phone for the first time . The trick is to initiate pairing on the PC while the bluetooth connection is active . For example , send a file from the phone to your PC ( using the `` copy '' function while a file is selected ) and quickly initiate pairing from your PC . You only have to go through this once , after that everything is a breeze . Hope that helps anyone who was as stuck as I was . EDIT : I just realized that this works best with the Broadcom/HP Bluetooth stacks I use on my laptop , if I figure it out for the MS default stacks , I 'll post on it .	1
I bought this phone ofr my in-laws a few months ago and it works great . Unfortunately , I do n't get to see their phone very often . Unless there is something better , this will be my next phone .	1
One person said in a review `` While this phone is thin , it is too bulky to handle , and seems flimsy . `` I could not disagree more . It feels extremly sturdy , and while it is not a tiny phone , it is very thin . It weighs more then you would expect , but I do n't mind because it feels a bit more well made.I had an off version of the Motorola V557 that I have had for well over a year now . I got it free , so I gave it up to a friend who needed a phone badly . I am a cingular customer . I was wanting a new phone anyways and it worked out well.I got the Nokia 6102 about one or two weeks ago . I have to say while it is a good deal for the price I just did n't like it at all . So I returned it and got the razr . I spent a bit more on the razr , but it was reasonable . ( ... ) .The razor is simple phone , a good phone . It comes in a very pretty case that will make you happy each and every time you open it ! It has a good quality camera ( it 's NOT a digital camera , its more like good quality web cam ) and I find it very easy to read , and dial because everything is so clear and spaced out nicley.I got the black version , and I nick named it KIT after the night rider car , it reminds me of it . Yeah I am a dork ! I had read some complaints that this phone did n't come with enough stuff , well at it 's launch price point I would say yeah it was overpriced . Now it has come down and it is a good deal in my book.I am very pleased with it so far ! Pleased enough to come write a review ! I also love all the cool accessories you can get , including vynle ( sp ? ) skins in any color you want .	1
I purchased this item a while back , but I remember that it was great item . I would definitely recommend it . After 10 years , I still have ATT .	1
In case you were wondering , the ONLY differences between the black and silver RAZRs are:1 . The Color2 . The Price Tag ( at some stores ) There are NO new features in the black RAZR . It has all the same specs ( and bugs ) as the silver model.In choosing a RAZR you should consider which color you like best , and whether or not you 're willing to pay the price premium some stores are charging on the black one.You should also read the reviews for the silver model , since both phones are the same inside.A couple of other notes : -The keyboard on the black RAZR is silver . Some people do not like this.-The RAZR ( probably the silver one only ) is rumored to be coming to another US carrier very soon ( Hint : starts with `` T '' , ends with `` obile '' ) -There will be a lot of new sharp looking phones with features superior to the RAZR coming out this fall .	1
I personally think the Black Edition RAZR phone looks really cool , better than the regular silver version . The phone is otherwise identical to its silver twin ... but , really , it just looks so cool -- and you 'll differentiate yourself from The Crowd.The phone is very capable and packed with features . Unlike some high-end Moto phones from a year or two back , this one works very well and has a decent interface . Everyone I know who has this phone simply loves it. [ ... ]	1
I am one to always have and use a lot of features . I like the Razr and would recommend it . Positives : light weight , small size , speaker phone works well , display is easy to see , voice dial is accurate , bluetooth , and it is great conversation piece . Negatives : Speakers ( normal and speaker ) not as clear sounding as my Nokia 6600 , no IR port , has a USB port but not software to use it - even for charging the phone , battery life a little short , video recording time way too short , difficult to find a name in the address book ( a lot of keystrokes ! ) .	1
Oct 7th 2005If you look carefully at these so called `` bad reviews '' you will notice most of them either do n't know how to use the phone OR may have been the 1-2 out of 1000 that received a faulty phone which happens from EVERY manufacturer , EVERY brand , EVERY type of phone.Now my wife & I have had ours for 12 days so far with no problems whatsoever , we ordered 2 , I got the Black one she got the silver one . Got BOTH for FREE btw.Just a word about those of you like us that want a `` shared plan '' from Cingular BUT Amazon does not offer those plans while you order , I ordered 1 phone with 1 cheapest single plan each , now when Amazon sends you the conformation that your order has been shipped you get your `` Cell phone Numbers '' right then in the email.I simply called Cingular gave them the phone numbers of each phone told them the deal and had the service changed to a `` single 700 rollover mins shared plan '' before we even got the phones in our hands , so there is no problems at all in that respect . Once we got the phones I called back to check and yes the person from Cingular had done everything as asked , I also checked from the phone itself as you can go to `` My Account '' from the Main Menu page and phone goes online and checks everything about your account , how many minutes , the plan , when the next bill is due , etc etc , and sure enough everything was as it was supposed to be.As far as signal strength it is excellent in my area , I can go all through our house upstairs and downstairs and it stays between 4-5 bars , I do n't recall seeing less than 3 bars all around town so far , the phone gets a great signal , and Cingular `` in my area '' puts out a great signal.My wife just came back from a business trip , she was about 150 miles away `` With NO ROAMING charges '' btw our last cell phone service `` Alltel '' would have been roaming within 20 miles.Anyway when she got to the hotel she called we both had perfect signal strength , we both put phone in `` Speaker Phone '' mode and she just laid the phone in closed position on the night stand while she unpacked her suitcases , I put mine on my night stand and we talked for about an hour with no problems at all , and it was a FREE call `` Mobile to Mobile '' .We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life , most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000.I 've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it `` needs '' charging , so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges , So I 'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge , and that 's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it 's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke . I have yet to drop the phone but it seems to be very well made to me , either way I would suggest getting a Krusell cover for it which I did but has not been delivered yet , and also insurance for $ 4.99 a month from Cingular which covers anything and everything for life of the phone , thus that problem is solved.Someone mentioned something about the `` address book being slow '' not even sure what that means , I only have about 8 numbers in it so far but it comes up virtually instantly for me , maybe if you have 100++ numbers in it might take a couple seconds ? dunno.As for searching through the phone book , they mentioned you have to make a new entry for each number for same person , NO you dont , you have the option to show numbers any way you wish , either by `` Name '' or `` Speed dial # '' or `` Voice name '' or even by `` Email '' and with or without a picture of the person.Want it faster and easier if you have a lot of names/entries ? then set it for `` list only '' `` no picture '' and by `` primary number only '' , simple . You can also separate numbers even further by putting in `` Categories '' such as `` Business/Personal/General/VIPs '' Bring up Category your number is in only that way even if you have 100s of Names & # s it thins them to category.When you have `` primary number only '' listed all you need to do then to get all the other numbers & Email listing for that Name is to `` Highlight name and use left or right on the Navigation button to get all the other numbers '' once again very simple and easy to use . I find the Phone book to be excellent & fast.1-2 have mentioned something about `` ear piece volume too low '' I 'm in total agreement with `` Harry G from TN '' the ear piece volume is fine just make sure the `` volume '' is turned up and it is just a good as any other cell phone I have ever used , but like Harry mentioned make sure your ear is right at the `` top edge of the phone '' , too low and volume will sound low.Now myself I find the phone overall to be excellent , gets a great signal , has way more than enough features for me , works very well for its intended purpose `` PHONE '' seems to be very well made , nice size , looks great , has a really nice screen with sharp image & colors.I have only ONE complaint so far ... ... The screen which looks outstanding inside under any indoor lighting , especially if you are in the dark , well that same screen outdoors under `` sunlight '' is virtually unreadable . So there you have my one gripe.I will come back and update this if anything changes , but as for right now and for FREE and can hardly see how you can go wrong with this phone . ( Update 4/30/06 . ) Well 7 months later and these phones are still working flawless with ZERO problems of anykind.I charge it maybe twice a week so battery life is still great.Neither my wife or I have this alleged sound problem some seem to have the earpiece and speakerphone volume are plenty loud.My wife is constantly playing solitaire on hers , so she has worked the hell out of that keypad the last 7 months and no problems.These phones are the best we have ever had by far , so like I said before take these `` bad reviews '' with a grain of salt.Some may indeed have a faulty unit which is going to happen regardless which phone you buy , but I bet a large percentage of these problems are simply operator error.These phones are excellent and I would recommend them to anyone.Still the only slight fault that I can gripe about on them is the screen is hard to see in bright sunlight.and it took an extra couple weeks to get rebate but was no problem , just a single phone call and problem was solved . ( Update June 23th 2006 ) Have had these phones over 9 months so far without a single problem , they work flawless.As I said above anyone giving this phone a bad rating either has that rare bad one of the bunch or simply does n't know how to use the phone . I have dropped this phone 3X so far , last time was 4 days ago in the parking lot on concrete and no problems at all , not even a scratch . ( Of course the Krussel case is outstanding and helps a lot ) We used both our phones while on a Cruise to the Caribbean and as long as we were in an area/Island that had cell service we had good reception and no problems at all , and as long as we were in a US territory ( Puerto Rico , St. Thomas , St. Croix , St. John ) the calls were not roaming.You get the phones for FREE , Amazon is good to order from with no problems , Cingular so far for us anyway have been very good and the service ( in our area ) is far better than what Alltel was.There may be some phones out there as good , some im sure will have a better camera , however I seriously doubt you will find a better all around cell phone & service .	1
Works ! !	1
I got two of these , one for the car and one for home use . There both work just fine , could be a little longer but works for must of my needs	1
I love this thing ! I 've bought them for my son & cuz who are also music lovers ! Can play my music on long trips and just riding around !	1
Scosche cables are the absolute best . Clear audio connection which is very compact in size . I use this brand for all my retractable cables and find their quality to be superb .	1
This is perfect as my aux input in inside the arm rest between the seats . Huge design flaw in the car pinches all other traditional round cords , and has destroyed a couple . This one just plus in and will retract to fit in the compartment with no fuss or tangling .	1
Works great - looks just like the picture shown , does everything it said it would do and is suppose to do in the description . Arrived within a week with Free Super Saving Shipping . I use it for my car , I connect my mp3 player to my AUX port in the car stereo system . Pulling both ends will release the cable , pulling one end will retract the cables .	1
This very high quality retractable cable will retract to as long as 32 inches ( I measured this ) . And it will easily retract back into the holder making the length of this whole cable unit at just 4.5 inches , which is PERFECT FOR TRAVEL . For me , I purchased 3 of these ( the maximum that is allowed in one order ) . And I am so pleased with these I hope to order more later on.You may wonder if the cable part is flimsy ... If it is not yanked , rather pulled gently and retracted gently , it will do fine . Remember not ot yank the cable out and it should last just fine.+ The main pro I find over this cable and non retractable cables is you just pull out the length you need , and no more dangling cables ! Very highly recommend this as it works well .	1
Vivo en Ecuador , lo compr & eacute ; hace unso 8 meses , la verdad no lo uso mucho pero igual se desempe & ntilde ; a bien cada vez que s lo usa , excelente calidad .	1
Good quality and performance for the price . if you are looking for a good and cheap aux cable this is a good option . The only thing is that you need to be careful when you use it , is not unbreakable .	1
This retractable cable is perfect for connecting ipods , phones , mp3 players , etc to the AUX input on a car . My middle console in the car tends to get super cluttered , so to have a cable which does n't get tied into knots and make a mess is a huge plus.The sound quality so far as I can discern is great with this cable.The retractor mechanism can tend to get stuck , but has always quickly snapped back into place after I jiggle it for a second.The cable is only 3 feet long , which is perfect for me , but depending on where your AUX input is may not be sufficient , so be aware of what you are buying .	1
I 'm here to let you know ; everything you are hoping this product to be , it is . The cord is healthfully long and the sound quality is very good . The retractable cord makes it very convenient to keep out of the way .	1
If you have a case that 's thick around the ports , this is the solution the nice thin connectors , work with bigger cases . Love that it retracts , people ask all the time where i got it .	1
Holy mackerel , these things are awesome ! Stows so very conveniently away and works very intelligently , locking in place wherever decide to stop it , rolling back up with just a tug . Have only had a couple of times where it decided to tangle up a touch when recoiling , but with almost no effort was able to pull back out and start over , coiling up properly like does all the other times . Buy a handful and have 'em in car , at computer , stereo - they 're so inexpensive but so awesome !	1
I hate the jumble of wires that are always wrapped around the shifter in my wife 's car so I ordered this for her . It replaced the 4 foot long cord that she used to have spaghetti piled up on the console and works just as good . She is happy therefore I am happy .	1
This audio cable is great for in the car ... The retractable cable is a space saver and looks cleaner while stored . Audio quality is normal , the end jacks and bigger that what they show in the picture , i wish they would change that . Over all , Great product , definitely recommend !	1
I love it . I use this in my car and is great that i dont have to deal with a buch of cable everywhere . Is usefull .	1
This thing is tiny & lightweight and works really well in a vehicle where you do n't want long cables hanging around ( especially if you drive a manual shift car ) .That being said , I have had two of these . I used them daily , and they each lasted about 4-6 months , and then they stopped working . The cables are very thin and I think they just wear out after a while . For the price & convenience , it 's not a bad trade-off . I would have given it 3.5 stars if I 'd had the option.I decided against ordering a third and opted for something non-retractable but hopefully more sturdy .	1
I have this and a retractable power cable that I keep in the car . I think they are great because they can go in the glove compartment and come out not looking like a giant puzzle knot .	1
I bought this cable to connect my MP3 to the car radio . I like the rotating design that I can adjust the wire in long or short distance , once I pull the cable , it will rotate back automatically .	1
I am going to start by saying I have had a lot of trouble with aux cables for my iPod , I use them every day in my car . I prefer the short , thicker , straight cables , but after a few months , something happens with the wires inside , and sound starts to come out of one speaker only . For a while , I thought something was wrong with my iPod . I got a new one , same problem . Then I thought something was wrong with my car . Had it looked at , no problems . So , I figured it was the cables . After going through a few more ( I 've been through about 7 , including the expensive Monster cable ) , I tried this cable as a last resort . It worked the best ! I had my first one for over a year with no sound issues . A friend of mine did n't see the cable and sat on it . When she got up , it retracted very quickly and hit my stereo . It broke off a small piece of my aux input . So , if you have passengers , beware , this thing can become a slingshot ! The retracting piece eventually broke , so I decided to get a new one . The new one worked fine , but after a short time , the retracing piece started working off and on . I have decided to just deal with it . I 'd rather have a broken retracing piece than a cable to only plays through one speaker .	1
I use this adapter for connecting an MP3 player to my car stereo on occasion . Being retractable it compacts to store in glove compartemnt when not needed . Never fails to rewind .	1
I like this cable as it is retractable on both ends ... takes little space , no fuss , with wires all over . Good product .	1
When you hate a bunch of cords everywhere , you 're glad to see products like this . I was very happy with such a simple purchase that could have turned into a nightmare .	1
I use this in my car , and I must say , it 's amazing to have a retractable wire like this to dock my iPhone when listneing to music.Other wires are either too small , too short , in the way , etc . etc.This makes it any size you or the person sitting beside you may like.Great product , cheap too ! & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ; & # 9734 ;	1
This is a vital accessory for all MP3 Players ! I love that it is retractable , so I do n't have a long cable getting tangle with other things ! Great price for this as well ! $ 5.55 with free shipping !	1
Bought this to use on a 12 hour car trip and it worked perfectly . The cord is about 5 feet long which is a good length . Had no trouble with it falling out of the psp like some others have commented on . Overall , you cant go wrong buying this product .	1
Its a charger , its great , it does the job , my kids use it all the time , would buy another , and would recommend .	1
For the price you ca n't go wrong here . Works perfectly for my PSP 3K . I have only used it a few times , so I 'm not sure about durability . We 'll see how it goes .	1
I really like this product . It keeps my phone together when I drop it and it looks stylish . I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with a RAZR .	1
This is the 4th Body Glove `` cellsuit '' case I 've owned , not because any of them ever wore out or broke , but simply because I 've bought them for four different phones . I bought this one for my Motorola Razr . The fit is perfect , all cut-ous line up with the phone ports , speakers , etc . This phone actually fits the Razr slightly better than the Body Glove I use for my Motorola V551.It provides some protection from drops , the elements , etc . both externally and internally , whereas many cases , including the popular hard cases for Razrs protect only the exterior.A few people have written reviews that the phone does n't close a swell as it does without the case . It closes fine . You add a slight thickness to the edge of the phone with a case on it , so basically it closes all the way , almost exactly the same as without a case , but because of the case , you wo n't hear the phone cover `` click shut '' but it is closed and its not like the front is suddenly lose or pops open . The case is a great value and works perfectly .	1
It really does fit my phone like a glove - looks good - I think it will last a long time . Worth every penny ! Prompt delivery . I recommend it to anyone with a RAZR .	1
This cover is just what I was looking for . It fits great . I can leave it on all the time while taking pictures , charging , etc . I had a different cover at first that I had to remove for pictures . I have n't found a con yet . And it looks good too .	1
I 've been using mine for over 4 years and it 's finally starting to show some wear with the wraparound earpiece , and having a few issues with it shutting off unexpectedly . All in all , for having it over four years , it 's a great purchase . Although I 'm still using mine daily , I 'm ready to purchase a new one , and one with a battery is the best , as I simply carry AAA batteries in my car , so whenever this one dies , I just put a new one in on the go . No worrying about bringing it into the house to charge , forgetting to take it back out , or losing the charging cord . I love it because it 's so convenient and can leave it in the car 100 % of the time , so it 's always for sure there .	1
Comfort : My main problem with this headset was that it is not very comfortable on my ear . When I first got it , I could n't wear it for more than 5-10 minutes . Now that my ear has become accustomed to it , I can wear it for an hour or so . It just takes getting used to . However , I wish I could rotate the headset without rotating the earhook like some bluetooth headsets . In order to have the headset have a tight grip on my ear ( and not fall off ) , I have to rotate the headset so that it points upwards towards my eyebrows instead of downwards towards my mouth . It 's not really an inconvenience per se , but it looks pretty uncool . Perhaps I have misshapen ears.Audio : The sound is fantastic . Only sometimes does it get staticky in my pocket , and not often enough to notice , at least on my end.Ease-of-Use : This headset was easy to pair with my Motorola KRZR and the main things I do ( hanging up , answering calls , and adjusting volume ) are simple and intuitive . Only problem is that if you do n't hold buttons for the correct length of time , it can perform the wrong function . For example , pressing the call button once activates voice dialing , for 1 second redials your last call and 3 seconds turns it off . I 've done my share of accidentally redialing.Battery : I was disappointed when I learned the battery was n't rechargeable and it instead uses a AAA battery , but the lifetime is very long . It 's supposedly 30 hours or so . I ca n't verify that , I just know I 've been using it for two months now without replacing it , and it 's just a regular Energizer battery.Durability : I carry this around in my jacket pocket most of the time and it holds up well . I do find myself accidentally turning it on when I lean against something , but I just need to be more careful .	1
The Motorola H300 is the ultimate handsfree headset for those that want a headset that they will be able to use forever . Why do I say this ? Because , this does not have a non-removable rechargeable battery like most handsfree headsets . Instead , it can be operated with a single AAA battery . I just got it , so I can not verify the performance of the battery , but knowing that I wo n't have to throw this away in a couple of years is worth it . The features include call accept , call deny , mute , hold , voice dialing , 3 way calling , and you can turn off the blinking blue light ( if you 're so inclined ) . Even though it takes a AAA battery , it 's about the same size as a comparable rechargeable headset . It may be 2 mm thicker , but the same length as most . It works great and is a no nonsense kind of headset . If you want a basic headset that does about the same as those expensive ones , and you want the security of just changing a battery , this is the headset for you . If I have any problems with the duration of the battery or with its operation , I will update this review accordingly ( check the date of review to gauge how long since purchase ... if no update , then no problem ) .	1
I keep one at my desk , one in my bag , one in my car.Battery life is fantastic -- standby and talk . If I 'm afraid of it turning on , I can pop the battery compartment with my thumb . Easy as pie.Pairs easily.Perfect and comfortable for my ears.Great sound , both ways.I 've used it on devices from my old Motorola PEBL to iPhone ( 1st Gen ) to Palm Pre.I 've bought or inherited 7 other bluetooth devices after getting one of these years ago , thinking they would improve on something already well-made . They did n't ... so I got two more of these H300's.Turns the AAA battery route ( I use rechargeable Eneloops ) works out GREAT for me ... after all these years , it 's never been a bother ... I do n't even notice it . There 's nothing to plug into the wall , no extra charger , I 've always got a spare AAA charged up in the house , bag , car for `` emergencies . `` I love this thing ... back at Amazon today to order one for my mom to try to convince her to use one of these things . She liked the idea of the AAA battery so maybe having to plug her other ones into the wall slowed her down too much.If you get this from one of the Amazon sellers you can get one new for half/third cost as of todays date ( 3-29-2011 ) .I 'm sure the technology on bluetooth headsets has improved by now but that 's what they said about a few other high-end POS I received from friends who tried to get `` the best '' for 3x the price . Think I 'll wait awhile longer before messing with this good thing I got going with the Moto H300s.Good luck !	1
I like this headset . Fits well if you adjust it according to instructions . Clear sound . Slightly on the quiet side , not bad . The best point is it takes AAA batteries so they are easy to replace . I had mine for 2 years before I lost it . Good price . Synchs well with my razor .	1
My last Bluetooth headset , a Cardo Scala 500 featured great sound , wonderful battery life but a poor , floppy fit and very crummy construction . The poor thing literally fell apart after three months.I replaced the Cardo today with a Plantronics Explorer 320 and I 'm pretty satisfied . First , recognize that there is no such thing as a perfect all-around headset for all phones and all users . It 's pretty important that you buy from a source , like Amazon , where you can try things and return them if not satisfied . EBay may have great prices on stuff , but unless you know you 'll like something , I would n't suggest buying a BT Headset there ... way too hard to return.The Plantronics 320 is a budget version of their upper end headsets , but it is hard to see where they scrimped . The fit and finish of the product is excellent . The power connector is solid and snapped in and charged the unit quickly . It paired up to my Treo 650 on the first try and was identified correctly by name.Using the 320 , I made several calls to automated numbers . All connected quickly , except the one where my phone automatically follows a script to punch in passwords . In that call , there was a considerable delay before the 320 took the audio signal from my phone . My old Cardo had the same delay , so I think this is a function of the phone.The fit of the headset is great for me . The unit has a small portion that inserts gently in my ear , and the wrap-around portion holds the device closely to my ear without any pressure or discomfort . I 've been wearing it all day and it is light and very comfortable . Your mileage may vary.So what 's not perfect ? The sound quality is n't quite there . I pick up some static between the device and my Treo and it gets worse when the phone is on the other side of my body or when I move more than five feet away . It 's not horrible , but it 's there in my setup . Again , your mileage may vary .	1
I have to say , this was a shockingly good experience . I have had mine almost a year when I lost it . I found it the following afternoon , in the parking lot at work . It spent a day and a night on the ground in the rain and even got either stepped on or driven over , as the earhook was broken off . The unit still worked ! It would wedge into my ear and I could still use it very easily-albeit uncomfortably . Why not 5 stars ? Because the ear hook pivot/swivel loosened with use to point where it would fall out of my ear . I replaced with a 350 due to budget , I wanted to get a 655 but we 'll see how this does .	1
I purchased this device after reading several reviews and just being focused primarily on price . I 've had it now for 3 days and it is great . I use a 700w , so despite the other review , this works great with my 700w no issue whatsoever . Yes it helps it to be on the same side as the phone , I carry my phone in a holster on my side , when I moved it to my left side as I was talking considerable static showed.Volume is great ( I was struggling with volume on my wired hands free headsets , but this has no problem with volume . ) Configuration , took about 2 minutes , 1 minute reading the manual and another minute doing it . The manual is about 2 pages , pretty quick and easy , just follow their steps and you are golden.Distance , any further from my hip and it would get more statis , about 2-4 ft it is good , beyond that , forget it . Considering the price , no complaint about that , my hip to my ear is all I need .	1
this is my second one of these I wore my first one for three years and it just broke but it is well worth the money I have spent on it works great pairs easy and last as far as talk time for the full eight to ten hours worth the money .	1
This headset is inexpensive , but the sound quality is great . It paired with my Samsung D807 in a couple of seconds . The ear piece goes in the ear , so outside noises are less distracting . With my old Motorola headsets , people complained that they could n't hear me . That has n't been an issue with the 320 .	1
I have owned this unit about three weeks now . I got this unit at a close out price , and I feel that I definitely got my money 's worth . I have never owned a Blue-tooth head set before so I have nothing to compare it to . I read reviews on the Internet and decided that this was the unit I wanted in my price range . The sound is clear and intelligible on both ends , ... as far as I can tell , even in the car , which is what I bought it for ... ( to use while driving ) ... and it is fairly comfortable for about 2 hours of ware , but after that becomes somewhat uncomfortable . I think with some adjustment it may be possible to make it feel even more comfortable , a lot of comfort depends on your own sensitivity , ear and head shape . Once paired with my phone , Razr V3 , it reconnects each time in a matter of seconds ( usually ) . Only once did it take longer . Before buying this headset I had never hear of Plantronics before , but I would say that their products have a good build quality and good sound . I liked these units more than the Motorola headsets mostly because of the way they fit rather than any sound quality issue .	1
It works pretty good and I can walk away from my phone and it is still clear . It does become a bit uncomfortable on the ear with long periods of wear .	1
I recently bought a new cell phone ( Sony Ericsson Z520a ) with Bluetooth . I spent a few days researching the various headsets out there , and soon discovered that only a handful appeared to be worth buying -- and all were between $ 100 and $ 150 , which I did not want to spend . I came across these by accident , and could n't find any of the negative comments common with headsets in this price range . Granted they 're only Bluetooth v1.2 , but they 're light , have a built-in rechargable battery , are quite comfortable to wear , and have very good sound quality . In addition , the pairing process is quite simple.If your priorities are quality sound , comfort , built-in battery , and reasonable price , these will be hard to beat . I like it so much I bought a second one for my wife .	1
this item came within time its great I got it for my mom she is currently is still using it and I order it over a year ago .	1
I just got this headset from Best Buy . I paid a little extra there because of the counterfeit scare in the online world ! However , I just love the sound . Specially the bass . Most of the ear-bud style headphones suck at reproducing bass . My T-Mobile MDA has paired up perfectly . The A2DP and the volume/play/pause/mute work like charm . I would give it a 5 star but it 's a little bulky for the gym . The cloth interior of the speakers will not stand the sweat for long . The shocks at the treadmill are yet to be tried out .	1
These headphones are great . There are a few annoyances that do n't make these superb.First , the bad ; it is true what others are saying about the comfort . After prolonged periods of use , they may start to hurt your ears a bit . Its not unbearable , but more like annoying . Secondly , they are a little big , but for what they do , its understandable . WARNING : These headphones will make you look like a tech dork . But who cares ? They 're freaking wireless.Now , with that out of the way , its time for the good parts . The sound quality is good . The battery life is long and wonderful ( 10 to 16 hours ) . Charge time is short . Charging is convenient using the same usb charger as my razr cell phone . Only need to bring one charger on trips . The quality is good . This headphones seem to be constructed well . Set up is generally easy . The directions suck , but the only vital info I found to be missing is that `` pairing '' can take up to a minute or so . The vocal quality is good enough . My callers can hear me well enough , but they are aware that I am using some sort of hands free device.Overall , I am very happy with these headphones . I would recommend these to anyone ( as long as you do n't mind looking like tech dork ) .	1
I purchased this headset to use with my cell phone . As it turns out I use it with my computer and love them . They are easy to use , long battery lfe and sound great . They may be a bit uncomfortable or odd because of the back of the head design but all headphones have some kind of pressure due to the design . The only time I notice their presure is when I wear them for a few hours . Short term no problems . By the way , I wear glasses so that may be the culprit.I 'd buy them again .	1
Before I have this product , I have ordinary earphones for my Moto680 cellphone which has stero radio , also I have other moto blue tooth earphone , but this one is good , long time power supply but it is more heavier than the single ear bluetooth.Volumn control is good , loud enough . single ear BT is out of control some times , you may hear nothing when you walking on the busy street or windy days . This one give you all availability.drawback : 1. when phone call comes in , you will wait for longer time than single ear BT . 2. the size is big , can not put in your regualr pocket . 3. the pad easily drops , you may lose one of the two very soon . I used glue.Anyway , it is good one , you can talk to 2 hours meeting several times with one time full recharging.I love it .	1
I paired it with my computer and cell phone at the same time , both for accepting audio streams . Pairing needs some trail but finally I can bond them . The pairing and re-pairing to my phone maybe because I have a ZN5.The quality and ease of use is very good . However , I have to get use to its behind of neck design . It is also a bit heavy and painful if you do n't wear it correctly . The problem is that if you do n't use it for a while , you have to take it off , or the narrow collar will squeeze the neck very uncomfortably.Recommended for ease of use , sound quality .	1
I got the HT820 a few days ago and for the most part I am very happy with it . Contrary to what some people have said , it *does* simultaneously connect with a phone and PC . I am using a Treo 700p PDA phone and a Lenovo X60 Thinkpad with integrated Bluetooth . If it does n't do that for you , it is most likely a driver/SW problem with your phone and/or PC . It takes two to tango and people are all too ready to blame the headset when it is just as likely to be a problem with their source.When I 'm listening to music I have stored on my X60 it plays the music well and the controls all work with Windows Media Player . If I get a call , the music will pause and I can take the call on my Treo . When I end the call , the music resumes . The sound quality is decent . It 's not audiophile quality , but if you want that from a $ 70 wireless headset , your head is screwed on wrong . It 's certainly good enough for what I want it for which is casual listening while I 'm working.One big plus is that the HT820 stays connected to my Treo 700p much better than my Plantronics Discovery 640 . With the 640 , the headset always drops the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a call . The 640 does this with my Treo 100 % of the time . I am reasonably sure it is a problem with the Treo 's BT so it is technically not the fault of the 640 , but the HT820 appears to handle the Treo BT problem much better.A few issues I have:1 ) My biggest problem is that the rubber that goes over the ears has a bit of a harder edge than I would like and after a little while it gets somewhat uncomfortable . I 'm going to try a little moleskin from the local Walgreen 's to see if that helps.2 ) The sound quality of the microphone is just so-so . My friends that hear me on the other end of my calls say it sounds somewhat muffled compared to my Plantronics 640 . They can still clearly hear me and understand what I 'm saying , but in a relative comparison the 640 has a better sound detection circuit.Finally , I do get occasional dropouts on my music , but I know it is the BT software on my Treo again . I can see that when the Treo drops the BT connection , the HT820 tries repeatedly to reconnect and the music from my PC gets spotty until it connects and then it 's fine again . The other times I get dropouts is when the X60 is doing something fairly processor intensive . I guess audio is considered low priority in the software and is one of the first things to get put on hold.As others have mentioned , there is a noticable lag in the audio when you are watching video or playing games . This is expected because of the extra encoding/decoding step that has to happen when you send it digitally over BT and then the headset has to decode it again . I would say BT headsets in general are best for listening to pure audio since there is nothing visual to be in sync with . They are OK for video if you can deal with the slight delay in the sound . It kinda looks like those old kung fu movies where peoples ' mouths will move slightly ahead of when you hear what they are saying . Any BT headset is going to have this issue until they come out with software and system design changes that compensate for it.I have tried it with some games and they are OK for turn-based games like Galactic Civilizations where the audio is not crucial to the game action . However , BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up . Got ta stick to low-tech analog headsets for that.Overall , it is very good but not perfect . If it were n't for the over-the-ear comfort issue , I would give it a 5 .	1
Durable . Sounds great . Mic provides good sound for those on the other endof the connection . I like the wrap-around fit ( walkman-style headphones look dorky - wrap around is better ) . Although.. after 30 minutes the tips of my ears can become sore which I am learning to cope with . I use it with Motorola L2 cell phone and Anycom 250 USB dongle for Skype . This is the one to get . I had a competing Plantronics product -- in fact two of them -- but they both broke in the same place due to the use of plastic in high-stress areas . The Motorola design is much smarter .	1
I got this headset last week Wednesday and have been using it ever since . I read a lot of reviews and found as much information as I could about this before even ordering it . And after reading very mixed reviews , I just had to find out for myself.So here it is : I use it with my Motorola Q , which is also not a bad phone , and it works perfectly fine with it . It paired up without any problems and stays connected when you want it to stay connected . I have not had the opportunity to really test out the battery life yet , but I have tested it for approx 2 hours in between charges and it holds up fine for 2 hours.Incoming sound quality is perfect . Actually a little too loud , but you can just lower the volume.Outgoing sound is also much better according my girlfriend who has heard me on my previous Sony HBH-660 , and she says that the sound quality is much better . Even when I have my windows rolled down going 65 , she says she can hear me fine , although she says it sounds like I have the faucet running . So I do question how the DSP itself works since it does n't really filter out the windnoise.The system itself is pretty sleek and gives you multiple charging options . So there should be no worry of running out of battery unless you talk consistently for more than 3 hours at a time.One gripe I do have is the button and the plastic . The button should be easier to press and should require as much pressure as it does . The plastic seems kind of cheap , which is probably what makes the thing so light , you barely even notice you have it on . So they should have use better plastic with better chrome paint that does n't scratch or chip off.Overall , I give it 2 thumbs up and the best headset I have used so far .	1
At airports watching people talking into space with some huge clam attached to their ear with a flashing blue light swore me off bluetooth . This headset from Plantronics is extremely small , nicely packaged , it paired immediately with my Blackberry 7100t.The packaging is very cleverly done and the headset itself is a simple silver cylinder and weights a mere 9 grams . Audio quality was high and a recent 7100t software upgrade increased volume levels to more than acceptable . A variety of included ear pieces ensure you 're likely to find a comfortable fit . I 've been getting about 2-3 hours of talk time on a single charge which while not perfect is adequate for most people.As a small minus , the button to connect/disconnect/turn-on or off takes a bit of getting used to as it feels a bit mushy missing a positive click to confirm your selection.If you 're worried about compatibility , the Plantronics website provides a pull down selector for mfg/phone to confirm .	1
This is my second BT ear set . My first was a Motorola with deficiencies in volume , talk time , not to mention how awkward it was to store when not in use.Plantronics has taken care of all of these areas . This unit is plenty loud , even when traveling in a noisy vehicle at highway speeds . The pen type slip case that goes in a pocket or clips on a shirt at the neck line is a good Idea . By using rechargeable batteries ( slides into the pen-style carrier ) you do n't even need to purchase a car charger or home charger . I 've purchased a small portable charger that goes into the computer bag I travel with . Every morning , I replace the battery and the head set stays charged all day long . When I say all day long , I mean it . I 'm on the phone over 3,000 minutes every month ... occasionally as much as 5,000 minutes . I love the Mute feature too ; most BT head sets do n't have this.The ear insert is the only thing I worry about down the road . It is always exposed and vulnerable . Not to mention the fact that it will probably discolor as it ages . This is the only reason I do n't give it five stars . But , in fairness , if having the insert is the reason for the great volume ... I would n't have it any other way.I have been using this product for over a month now and I recommend it highly.Plantronics , one recommendation for you ; make the battery rechargeable so I do n't have to change it out every morning . Charge me for it , its all good .	1
I purchased this headset from Amazon for about $ 80 and have had it for over a month . I pair it with my RAZR and Uniden 's cordless ELBT595 . I 've been highly pleased with it 's performance.BLUETOOTH PAIRINGThis was extremely easy and handled through the one master button at the top . Hold it down until it flashes red and it will pair with your phone . Answer calls by pushing the button , and hang up by pushing the button . Simple as that . I 've gotten consistent call quality within a range of 10 feet from the phone , and have n't experienced any interference from WiFi networks.VOLUMEI think the biggest problem with bluetooth headsets is that they are not loud enough . I tried several different bluetooth headsets that my friends have , most noteably the Motorola HS850 and H700 . Those work well but I still have a hard time hearing people when I 'm driving in a car , or there is a low level of ambient noise in the background . The greatest feature of the Plantronics 640 is that it fits in your ear , and is therefore probably twice as loud as any other headset I 've tried . I can hear while I 'm driving in the car , and usually do n't even have to put it on it 's loudest setting . You can also mute the headset by pushing the up and down volume buttons simultaneously.COMFORT/FITI was skeptical about the fit of this headset . I never liked earbud headphones ( think iPod ) as they fail to stay in my ears whenever I have to move around . That 's why I was astonished that the Plantronics 640 stays in my ear without any problems . And it is very comfortable as I 've worn it for periods over 1 hour and have not had any irritation . Since it fits in your ear , and not over it , you can easily wear sunglasses with it ( great for driving ) . If I know I 'm going to be highly active while wearing the headset , I will put the optional over-the-ear clip on it , but for most instances it is not necessary.DESIGNThe 640 is small and light , and stylish enough for me . The headset comes with a bevy of attachments and a carrying case . The headset fits into a `` pen-clip '' holder that serves two purposes . First , you can carry your 640 in your shirt pocket if you wish ( and look extremely nerdy I might add ) . But the pen clip adapter is the common link to charge the headset . Put the headset into the pen clip and you can now charge it with the included AC adapter , or you can add one of the extra attachments to the pen clip so that you can use your phone 's charger to also charge the 640 . Almost all phone types are supported . There is also a AAA battery adapter that can link up to the pen clip and be used to charge your 640 . The battery life of the headset itself is great ; I 've talked on it for about 5 hours and the headset still did n't die.PROBLEMSThere are few and they 're nit-picky ones . It 's unfortunate that the adapter to use the RAZR 's mini-USB phone charger to charge the 640 is not included . You can buy one off eBay for under $ 20 , though . The pen clip adapter is ok , but not the absolute best way to carry your 640 around . It fits in any pocket , and protects the mic , but does not cover the earbud side of the headset . Therefore , I usually carry the 640 in the small case it comes with . But this case holds ALL the attachments and it would be nice if there was something smaller to transport the headset alone that protected the entire headset and was smaller than the full case . Some people have also complained that the mic picks up lots of ambient noise . I find this to be the case of all headsets , bluetooth or corded . If you 're in a crowd , people are not going to be able to hear you on your cell phone or bluetooth headset -- they are going to hear the crowd . I believe there is a new 645 model that has some noise-cancellation features , but that is done with digital software processing , not filters physically sitting on the mic.OVERALLI do n't think the perfect bluetooth headset has been produced yet . But I 'm giving this one 5 stars because as of June 2006 this one is reliable and is undoubtably the loudest headset out there . My hearing is just fine , but if the volume on your headset or cell phone is the biggest sticking point with you , then this is probably the best headset you can get . If you can get this headset for $ 80 or less , I highly recommend it .	1
I 'm very impressed with this headset . The set up was simple on my SE K700i phone . I just paired the two devices and added it on in handsfree mode . This headset is light and extremely comfortable in my ear . Just move the gel earpiece to the left if you use it in your right ear for additional comfort . Conversely , move the gel earpiece to the right if you use it in your left ear . It fits so well in my ear that I do n't have any need to use the ear loop.The sound clarity is great . Everyone I talk to says they hear me very well . I just needed to raise the volume up a little to hear everyone perfectly . I do n't hear any static whatsoever when I use this headset in my wifi and bluetooth networks at home.Plantronics gives you a lot of charging options . I use the SE charging adapter , which I snapped on at the bottom of the little pocket case , so I could use one charger for two gadgets . This headset comes with a Nokia , Samsung , Siemens and Sony Ericcson adapter for charging . The headset also comes with its own charger , in case you do n't own one of these 4 phone models , which you can use in any wall outlet . I tried that method of charging and it works fine too.This headset also comes with a mobile charger case , where you use a AAA battery . I did n't try that method of charging since I have a SE car charger which works well with the included SE adapter.Voice dialing works fine . That 's important to me since I 'm a mobile professional who spends a lot of time traveling in my car.The headset does beep right before you make a call . It also beeps right before it signals for the name you want to call . I do n't find that irritating , as one other reviewer mentioned . That 's just how the headset operates . And let me emphasize that this headset works great.It is the best bluetooth headset I 've ever owned .	1
I bought this headset for my wife for her to use with a Samsung A900 ( `` the blade '' ) . The earpiece is extremely small and comfortable and the battery life is long enough for her to talk on it over an hour each day . She charges it each night . The sound through this headset has a typical `` bluetooth tinny '' aspect that overly compressed digital sound has but it is in-line with what I 've observed on other bluetooth headsets.The number of adapters and the clever battery-powered charger attachment help this headset stand out from the crowd.Setup is a breeze and it is very easy to use . She is not a technophile but she loves her handsfree Plantronics 640 ! The unit would be 5 stars if the sound quality were better . I also wish it had multipoint like the 5xx-series from Plantronics .	1
I am a previous user of the Logitech Mobile Freedom headset ( lost from dropping it in a movie theatre ) and of many others so I do know what a bluetooth headset should be.First impressions : I liked the size of the headset and the spiffy metal case where you can store all the included trinklets . They even give you a mirror on the back of the case ( I guess so you can see how cool you look with the headset ) . Out of the box , it 's easy to setup . Took about 1.5 hrs to charge the headset.Pros : This headset is light , small , and well designed . The ear gel is n't intrusive like the old Jabras . I would say it 's like an earphone that you would use for mp3s , except it 's made out of rubber which is good so it wo n't slip out . they give you 2 other gels if the default does n't fit . I have a small set of ears , and the default is perfect . It pairs easily with my LG PM 325 ( Sprint Phone ) . I do n't notice a difference between this and my old Logitech in terms of sound quality , meaning the quality is excellent . They heard me , I heard them , it was clear , no static . If you DO get static it 's just the downfall of BT technology ( wi-fi , walls , or microwave interference ) . It also comes with 4 different charging attachments for Motorola , Nokia , Siemens , and Sony Eriksson . You can also use the power adapter they supply which works well . I like the pen/marker sized charger you can put it in , and though I ca n't see myself using the AAA battery option to charge , it 's great to be able to charge it anywhere if need be.Cons : Well , here it is : I wish there was a wind guard . This would be a great feature to have since it 's so mobile , and would n't it be better if we could use it outdoors ? Foam is n't that expensive to add ... Secondly , there should have been noise reduction feature . Trust me , it pick up everything ; dishes in the back , people talking , stereo , blah blah . Oh well . Otherwise it 's great . . Other than that , the price is the biggest con . I got it here when J & R ; had it for $ 69 . But $ 89 ? ! Ridiculous . Even $ 70 is high for a BT headset these days . But hey , you pay for the look , feel , and fit.If you do n't care about obtrusiveness , get the Logitech Mobile Freedom . It 's cheaper . One thing that was different is that the Logitech after finishing a call , sometimes it would disconnect from my phone ( the BT connection I mean ) which was annoying if I wanted to make another call right away . With this plantronics 640 , I do n't have that issue which is awesome !	1
I read the reviews here and other sites and bought this headset , my first bluetooth headset for my samsung 870 phone . Came with a lot of adapter accessories for different phone chargers except the samsung models . So that was all useless to me . Nice silver case which looked good but also useless to me since I 'm not going to carry an extra box around when I 'm trying to simplify.ProsPairing was a breeze.Sound quality excellent with the windows of your car closed.no real complaints.ConsWith the windows of your car down it was hard for the caller on the other end to hear you , or the radio on for that matter.I could really never find a comfortable fit for my ear so guess what happened , The day we bought a 6ft Christmas tree I lost it ... ... . fell out of my ear for the first time in public and now all I 'm left with is a shiny silver case and a bunch of junk	1
I was using a Jabra 250 before this one , but ended up breaking the Jabra accidently ( it 's a good product itself , by the way ) , so wanted to get something to replace it.I was drawn to the `` coolness '' factor of the Plantronics , the nice case , the attachments , the little holder with clip , etc . And the fact that it 's so small . Also , i 've used Plantronics headsets for many years and they make a great product.It 's not perfect , which is why I give it a 4 out of 5 . But it does work well , and it 's so small and lightweight you barely notice it 's there . The 3 earbuds give you a pretty good range of sizing , in my opinion , but the ear-clip thing is not that great . It 's much better just balanced in your ear with the right size earbud.No , you ca n't use it outside on a windy day , but you ca n't use ANY headset like that , well , maybe some of the higher end noise cancelling units , but not something this small . The reviews that knock that fact are not being fair . It works great for what it 's designed for , and if you need to use it in bad conditions , get a noise cancelling headset , or you will never be happy.Paired up with my Treo 650 with no problems , and actually works better than the Jabra with my Treo . The Jabra would want to be 'reset ' before every call , or it would default to the built in mic , but the Plantonics just works once it 's turned on . And when you get a call while wearing it , just hit the easy to find button to answer and again to hang up . Works fine .	1
A very lightweight and thin case . Very good fit while still easy to remove from the case . The texture on the back improves grip and I have the feeling that the Nexus is well protected .	1
fits like a glove , good design , just got it today and im impressed . i really like how it seperates the volume up and down buttons as well as the power button . also makes them easier to push . i wouldnt trust it to save the screen from a 3 foot drop but for ordinary use i think it will serve me well.. also the material has a good feel to it . and its not to slippery .	1
If you do not expect to be bashing your Nexus 7 , this is a great and convenient wrap for it and it looks good .	1
it is a nice rubber case that fits snugly around my nexus.I like it and it will protect it from small drops and bumps . I would by no means expect it to protect it from a full fledged fall or smash against concrete . good for me I do n't plan on throwing it or dropping it from any heights I just seem to have little slips and this is good for that . I am happy with the product	1
I put this on yesterday and it was a good fit ... .hopefully it will protect to a certain point and keep it clean .	1
This case cover is very thin and I imagine would only protect from scratches and the smallest of bumps . It fit my Nexus quite well , to the point it was causing me some trouble to get it over the edges of my screen cover . But once done I am happy with it . There is no excessive movement , the buttons work easily still and the cut out for the speaker and plug ins work perfectly . It also gives some extra grip to the rather slick Nexus , making one hand operation and reading safer and easier .	1
I honestly love this case . At first I was sort of skeptical about its back design , now I get it though , it obviously needs the two textures to add grip and the other one to make it smooth enough to fit into your pockets with no additional friction to it .	1
With TPU cases it 's usually a hit or miss . With this one , my Nexus 7 is a happy tablet . The back area has a flat , slick , X area while most of the sides retain a textured area that works very well when holding in your hand . I often surf the web or watch videos while in bed and have had no problems with the case being slippy . For the money this is a great case and probably the best you will get under $ 10 .	1
This product is really good and easy to use . 2 of the 3 provided solutions work perfectly . However , the circular adhesive console/dash disc is useless because the suction base terminal is heavy and the disc keeps falling . I am not using it anyway , therefore this product deserves a 4/5 .	1
This replace the piece of junk clingo that would warp everytime it hit the sun . I am overally pleased with the product . The flexible neck is a bit stiffer than I would have liked , but maybe it has to be that stiff to hold the phone .	1
This is large enough to hold my I pod touch in an otter box case and my mytouch with out a problem , so my guess is it can hold just about any portable device or cell phone on the market . The grips work well and I have only had it fall off once , but then I licked it and put it back on and have n't had any problems sense . I do n't use the vent holder but it looks like it might work if I played with it for a while .	1
I 've had another bluetooth headset for more than two years . I 've never been happy with its performance-it was small and light , but at freeway speeds I just could not hear the other party.I purchased this headset four days ago . I could not be happier . This morning I sat it on my head for a long commute , and forgot it was there within 5 minutes . The road was wet , but even with the accentuated tire noise I could hear every word . I made several calls , and one person was not aware I was in my car.I have a slight audio discrimination problem , which makes it hard for me to hear over noise . This headset has a leatherette ear cushion that fits over the ear , blocking most noise . It can also be turned quite loud , uncomfortably so . This is great , because you are never wanting for volume.It comes with both wall charger and car charger , so I 'll never have to carry this one in to the house to charge it.Look at the photos before buying : notice that this is a big headset . That 's part of what makes it work so well , but if you want the compromises inherent in the tiny designs , do n't buy this.UPDATE : After another week , I 'm still totally excited about this product . a couple of days ago I ran a conference call from my cell phone , from the car . One of the other parties was on a lousy speaker phone . I could hear them perfectly.UPDATE AFTER ONE YEAR ( January 2009 ) : Just keeps working . Still pleased as punch . Battery still lasts forever .	1
This is the best headset for truckers . The back ground noise can not be heard from caller . The ear pices is just the right volume . the Mice takes some use to it . When you talk , you talk in a normal voice . and do n't have to speak up to be heard . If you put the mice at your mouth , it will distort the sound . The best place just below your lower lip . The paring has to be done every time to turn the headset on . Will not automatic paring at turn on . Good thing its easy do to.The charge time is great and really holds the charge in stand-by and talk time . the only thing I do n't like its heavy and sometimes the mice gets caught on the shoulder strap , when looking side to side .	1
I drive a truck and found out how hard is finding a good bluetooth headset . Many I have tried worked fine , but the biggest problem was that other party could not hear me ( because of engine noise ) . When I accidentally found this one I gave it a try . And it is awesome . People think that I am talking straight to my phone . Call quality in my opinion is even better when I use this headset.PROS : - perfect voice quality- battery lasts long- noise cancelling microphone makes others to hear you- solidCONS : - bulky- expensive ( but worth this money )	1
I , M A TRUCK DRIVER AND THIS HEADSET IS PERFECT FOR USE IN TRUCKS , MY FRIENDS TURNED ME ON TO THIS MODEL . I USED OTHERS THAT SAID THEY WERE NOISE CANCELLING AND THEY DID A NICE JOB IN MY CAR BUT SOON AS I USED THEM IN MY TRUCK NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND ME . THE BLUE PARROT HAS A NICE QUIET SOUND TO IT , EVERYONE SAYS I SOUND GOOD ALSO WITH THE THE CUP EARPIECE I HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME DOWN OR IT BLOWS ME OUT SO YOU HEAR VERY WELL WITH IT . THE ONLY THING I HAVE EVER HEARD CLOSE TO THIS WAS THE PLANTRONICS 510 BUT THE EARPIECE WAS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THIS	1
I noticed a few reviews stating the sound was good but it 's quite the opposite . The sound is muffled and you have increase the volume level to the max to even hear it . I used these headphones with my new sony ericsson w350 . Though the sound is aweful , the functionality and dirt cheap price makes up for it . It 's your basic handsfree one button headphones but the good part is it allows you to replace the headphones with any others as there is a jack at the end of the hands free . I have a seperate set of sony earbuds that sound amazing and used them on the handsfree . The sound quality jumped and allowed me to continue using hte hands free feature . The only draw back is it left a ton of wiring all over the place as my earbuds have a long cord to begin with and the hands free is almost as long . That was a big draw back but I dont fault these phones . I was extremely satisfied with this purchase despite the drawbacks and you just cant beat the price.VERY IMPORTANT : For those of you that care for looks , these phones did not come in silver as indicated in the 1st picture above . They came in black as in the second picture . I prefer black so Im okay with it but if your looking for silver , you will be dissapointed .	1
These have clearer sound and more base than the earphones that came with my Sony P1i phone . They are a bargain . I suppose that they are not as good as $ 100 earphones , but for this price , I do n't expect them to be . Mine came in a simple plastic bag without Sony packaging , but they do appear to be a real Sony product . There are included in the package 3 different size rubber tips to fit different ear sizes .	1
they work great . came with my phone . kind of an odd set up with different lengths of wire and the ear things are not foam , they 're rubber . so that 's odd , but they sound good .	1
Excellent price for a spare or replacement headset for certain Sony Ericsson phones . The headphones are the in-ear kind and sound better than any inexpensive phone trinket should . Although the phone I bought them for is on standby service now , I still have the headphone part ( it separates from the mic and proprietary dongle ) and use it daily for casual music listening on my mp3 player . When connected to the phone , call quality is good and the mic is reasonably sensitive .	1
I bought this phone for the sole purpose of making calls and because of the bluetooth feature . I have handsfree bluetooth link in my car , and it has been a great help in allowing me to focus on driving and not holding a phone . I had a Motorola Razr V3 that was given to me when I signed up for my plan , like most products built now days the stupid thing died just out of warranty period , and do n't ever expect a helping hand from Motorola , and much less T mobile they both could care less . When I received this phone I installed the SIM card and started to use it , I have had it for a few weeks now and the reception is better than the Motorola , plus I was able to install a few games and apps . on this phone that make it just what I was looking for and then some . The best part of this is that I did'nt have to lock in under another contract with T-mobile and when the contract is up so will my business to them . I think its a great phone for the money , packed with features , and especially the bluetooth integrates really well with the handsfree in my car .	1
Basically , what I need in a cell phone is the ability to make calls to people I want to speak with , and to receive calls from people who need to speak with me . That 's it ! Of course , any old phone will do that , but there 's my image to look out for , so I also want it to look expensive and sleek , to be able to pick up signals even in office blocks , have long battery life , and have tons of cool features to talk about , even if I never use them . The ability to withstand sudden impacts and the occasional passing shower is also an asset.So far , this phone has met all my needs as follows : ( 1 ) It makes calls just great ( 2 ) It receives calls clearly ( 3 ) It looks trendy with its cute little handle-shaped antenna , which is very useful as a handle when pulling it from your bag ( 4 ) It 's not the most expensive , but it looks like a million bucks ( 5 ) It picks up signals in office buildings ( and elsewhere ) ( 6 ) Excellent battery life ( 7 ) It fell and survived ( JAN 16 - EDIT : IT FELL AGAIN AND THE INTERIOR DISPLAY IS DAMAGED . THE PHONE HOWEVER STILL WORKS ) ( 8 ) It got drizzled on and survivedFeature wise : ( 1 ) It has a camera and can take video recordings ( 2 ) You can set up speed dialing fairly easily ( 3 ) It has flashing lights when it rings , and you can change the light shows ( or turn the darn thing off already ) ( 4 ) Lots of memory for lots of numbers , e-mail addresses , birthdays and so on ( 5 ) You can set different lights and ring tones for each one of your friends ( 6 ) You can show a different photo on the display outside to the one inside . ( 7 ) It has a stopwatch and calculator ( 8 ) It has a loud speaker ! ( All the better for us all to hear you my dear ) ( 9 ) Media player , and use can use a headphone ( sold separately ) ( 10 ) Voice activated commands ( Answer and Busy , or you choose ) ( 11 ) Changeable covers to meet your mood ( Always gray , thank you ) ( 12 ) Big numbers and letters for easy dialing and text messages ( if you 're the texting kind ) ( 13 ) It can vibrate ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( Call me back ! Call me back ! ) ( 14 ) I had somebody send me Crazy Frog as a ring tone , so I can REALLY annoy my favorite people . ( It 's got Bluetooth and infra-red for transferring data - but do n't ask me how to use them - I just like saying that I have it ) ( 15 ) Lots of shortcut keys to get to things quickly ( 16 ) Internet services ( I ca n't use these yet , because my provider does n't offer it ) ( 17 ) it has a very nice alarm clock featureThings not so great about it : ( 1 ) The position of the camera button is bad for me . I use a Body Glove case , and when I pull out the phone , I sometimes inadvertently take a picture on the way out . Similarly when trying to open it in a hurry . ( 2 ) The picture quality is n't the best ( 3 ) It 's not easy to open with one hand ( 4 ) While the volume buttons are conveniently placed on the side , I sometimes hit them when answering a call . ( 5 ) The sound is kinda tinny ( 6 ) Not enough cool ring tones ( yeah , I can get more , but using Bluetooth means I have to read the manual ) ( 7 ) You have to remember to use the arrow keys to get to other tabs in the menus to see all the features ( 8 ) Speed dialing needs two buttons ( I 'm accustomed to holding down one button ) ( 9 ) The lights go out really quickly before you can finish deciding what you 're looking forOverall , a great phone for the price , and it looks good too.Amanda Richards , January 10 , 2006	1
Amanda Richards hit the nail on the head , but she did n't get into how nice the Bluetooth is on this phone . In addition to being a VERY SOLID ( both in build and function ) phone with a lot of features you would n't expect to find in something this low in price , you 'll also get FULL Bluetooth 1.2 capability.What does this mean ? Well , you can transfer mp3 ringtones to it , you can connect a headset to it , you can transfer themes and photos to and from it and you can even tether it to your laptop to use as a modem ! If you want a fancy phone , you 'll have to pay for it . But , if you want a decent phone that has an awesome battery life , a sharp , colorful screen , Bluetooth that works and custom themes , then you ca n't do better than this ! I like this phone and use it often as a backup phone .	1
This is a solid flip-style cell phone , in my humble opinion.I bought the phone for one main reason : I wanted a flip phone with a voice recorder feature . While Motorola phones to come equipped with a voice recorders , the amount of memory that one is allowed to use for voice records is very limited . With this phone , I can compose many short notes to myself , such as what items to buy from the grocery store , whom to call , what the license plate number was of the person who hit my car , etc.The phone 's camera is also adequate for my purposes . However , I 'm not a big photo taker . I have used the phone to document damage to my car ( after I had a broken car window , for example ) .The data cable and free software pack is that you can download from Sony 's website allow you to transfer images and sounds to and from the computer with relative ease , free of charge.One annoying feature of the phone : it takes a non-standard headset , charger , and data connection cable . So , you can not use handsets equipped with standard 2.5 mm connectors . unfortunately , I have not found a very good Bluetooth headset that works well with the phone . So , one 's best bet is to use the standard headset that comes with the phone.as previous reviewers have commented , the phone 's screen does blank from time-to-time.It is difficult to use the voice-activated dial feature . Recognition is very poor with this phone . Motorola phones , in general , have slightly more sophisticated voice-activated dial features.It is also fairly easy to record conversations using the voice-recorder feature . So , let 's say you 're on the phone with someone in the car , you do n't need to have pen and paper in hand to take down addresses or phone numbers . You can simply record the needed information and playback . I often use this feature when I 'm calling restaurants or merchants for addresses , telephone numbers , or directions.I 've found that battery time is generally quite good.As with all cell phones , make sure you determine what features you want in advance , do your research , and purchase a phone that has all the features you want.I , for instance , am most interested in the voice-recorder that this flip phone is equipped with . I can live with the phone 's other deficits.I would suggest going in to one or more stores to make the purchase , if possible . I realize that is not always possible , particularly with phones that are not very popular or with unlocked phones , as in this case.nevertheless , if you do your research somewhat carefully and thoroughly , you can generally find a phone that meets your needs .	1
I use in an old-school minivan , with a deep dashboard , and my phone is a Galaxy II ( I know , I 'll update it soon ! ) Pros:1- Sticks well on window . I 've used on all kinds of roads ( and switched to 3 different cars ) , always works great.2- Easily adjustable . Quickly adjusts to whatever angle , whether flexing the arm or turning sideways/straight up . The ability of the tabs on the side to fold in are the best design of the 3 I 've had . The others maintained a fixed holder on the bottom , which affected how it held when I turned it sideways.3- Wow , I love the grip design . It allows each arm to slide left/right . So , I can keep the bottom ones tighter to avoid pressure on my volume buttons while sliding one of the top ones to avoid pressure on my action button.I have n't found a con yet.Good luck !	1
The adjusting capability and holder works in all my vehicles from my truck to the SUV easy to install and use	1
I received my swivel mount and spent a few minutes playing with it . It holds my Droid X pretty securely with the adjustable sides that also have adjustable sliding arms that go up and down , so I do not have to have any of my buttons blocked . The swivel section is very bendable , but it is stiff and will hold its shape well . The side arms have a foam coating so they really grip my phone well once they are pushed in . Releasing the phone is very easy too , you just push the button on the bottom and the side arms release the pressure and slide out allowing for easy retrieval of your phone or GPS unit.This unit is made to mount to the windshield or some other smooth surface . I am in New Jersey and its illegal here to have anything attached to your windshield . I do not have any smooth surfaces to attach the suction cup to my dash , so a little ingenuity was called for during my installation . I took a flat piece of sheet metal , cut it about 4 inches square , sanded it , painted it , then did some light sanding with a very fine grit paper over the paint to make the surface absolutely smooth . I then attached my custom built metal plate to my dash with some strips of double-stick tape . Then I attached the suction cup to the plate and it holds very well.This is a very good mount and appears to be made very well . I expect a long life with this product.Ps : my friend has the same mount that clips on his air conditioning vent . He loves it and told me about it , that is how I came to find this one . I did not want to block the vent , so I got the one with the suction cup and long arm .	1
Bracketron just plain makes good products . Works great.What else can I say . Here are a few more words to meet the minimum word requirement .	1
Update 2/17/14 The unit is still working however it has gotten more difficult to get the unit to suction to the window . Not sure what to attribute this to . Once again if you are trying to install on a cold windshield ... forget it . The glass and suction cup have to be warm to get a good suction.Update 7/24/13 The mount worked as advertised until early July when I dropped it with the phone attached . Broke the side bracket . Purchased the exact same unit.Update 2/24/13 Still love the mount . Works flawlessly.I have only had the mount for a few days but it is better than anticipated . I drive for a living and have used the mount in 6 different vehicles . Works perfect in all . Easy and flexible to use in any vehicle . Have yet to have the suction demount . This should fit the Galaxy Note 2 without a problem.I 've been using it for a couple weeks and still working great . If you live in a cold climate you may have issues with the suction . We went through a cold spell here in SoCal ( 40 's ) and it was more difficult to get the unit to suction . Once car warmed up , no issues .	1
The Bracketron products are top notch . Already had one of these for MY car and the Missus was so taken with it she wanted one of her own . Found the best price on Amazon and bought it right away . Now the Wife is very happy . . . Thanks .	1
The design is very cheap but I had to give it 4 stars for the price and the fact that I was able to get it to work with my Samsung Galaxy S3 .	1
When I first bought this it worked magnificantly.. but then winter came and it got too cold . When I tried to adjust it , it fell off ... every time ! I think it 's a great tool and I hope that they make more with improvements for different temperatures .	1
Almost nailed it with this one , Bracketron . First , the good : the mount is solid , it stays stuck to the glass , and the flexible arm bit is VERY stiff and hard to adjust but really stays put once you have it where you want it . Now , the not so great : the flexible arm seems to vibrate quite a bit while you drive , and the expanding bracket does not work as well as promised . In fact , the button on the side only seems to open the bracket if you have it rotated 90 degrees to the left ( as in landscape , with the button pointing up ) . I took it apart and realized that this is because there is an assortment of rather cheap gears which rely on gravity to allow the button to only work in one direction . I much prefer my Grip Go , but if you need a longer mount and/or one with a bracket then this one isnt bad for the price , just not perfect .	1
I use this on my Audi S4 , placing the suction cup not on the windshield , but the plastic piece right in front of the car control 's screen ( which is regressed from the front of the console ) . it has JUST enough room for the full cup to sit in front of the screen and to the right , so i still have full view of it . the bendable arm is good , it allows me to put the phone in just the right spot and is fairly strong ( i have the arm pretty compressed , it 's not stretched out ) .as others mention , the surfaces have to be clean . but another trick i use is to apply a little water ( or spit will work ) on the suction cup . just enough to moisten it , before putting it down on the surface . this creates more adhesion so it stays put.the only thing to be aware of is that you really ca n't adjust the arm much while its suctioned down . doing so pops it off ( at least off the plastic surface , not sure about windshield ) . but so far , while driving and holding my Galaxy S2 phone , it 's been sturdy . i wish there was a version that had a shorter bendable arm , but all i could find were ones that were not bendable , just somewhat adjustable.Overall , a good product and i 'd recommend it .	1
Bought this because I drive a lot and needed to have my phone be hands free , I 've got ta say I 'm pretty impressed with the quality and durability of this product . I 've owned other cellphone brackets , and so far this one has lasted the longest . Would definitely recommend this product .	1
This holder is great because it 's adjustable to several devices . I use it for my iphone and have never had a problem . It always stays in .	1
Love how it is formable . I can bend it to longer or shorter , any angle and still turn the phone in place . Opens easily and usually can do it one handed with no issues.Highly recommend for people with no ability to mount directly on dash and have to use windshield .	1
Pros : Very adjustable for different size phones and has a pretty nice reach and stays on the windshield nicely.ConsThe only problem I have is I had to glue the two peaces together because the backing kept coming off when I was removing my phone several time .	1
Make sure u mount on windshield using the dash as support otherwise u will get alot of vibration when u drive the car . Other then that its a good product . I use it for my HTC Evo works good with it .	1
Review on original purchase : I was tasked by my office manager to purchase some headsets to make our office calls easier . I looked at corded headsets , cordless , and a variety of brands , but this unit kept coming up with high praises.The clarity is great , and it has a variety of volume ( macro and micro ) for both the mic and earpiece . It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options . The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer . Not to mention that if I 'm not at my desk and the phone rings , I do n't have to rush back . I can use both my hands to look up quotes , and stock while I 'm on the phone without craning my neck . Their are earpieces and over the head options . Not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug it in at night.This order was to add to the existing setup we already had . Love these things !	1
We bought the Plantronics CS-55 Wireless Headset over three years ago for use in our small business and it was one of the best purchases we have made . My wife asked me to get her wireless headset that she `` would n't have to mess with '' so I selected this one since it is what my company uses ( a Fortune 500 ) in it 's call centers . Here are my observations : + Good Range ; the unit covers all of our fairly large shop+ Easy to Setup ; just follow the simple instructions and go+ Easy to Use ; simple as picking up the phone and turning on the headset ( we addedPlantronics HL10 Handset Lifterto make it even easier ) + Great Sound Quality ; we never had any static issues , even in our heavily wireless environment- Heavy ; not absurdly so , but takes some getting used toThis headset gets used just about everyday that our shop is open and it has never given us any problems . It has passed the test of time with flying colors ! Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
My job requires me to take a lot of notes while I talk on the phone . I have counterparts in two remote offices and we spend a lot of time on the phone . Trying to hold the cradle with my shoulder while I type is horrible -- it slows me down and eventually hurts . A headset like this is mandatory for me.I 've used other headsets before . This one is really good ( although I 've used other Plantronics models that were more comfortable ) .This unit plugs into your phone , either into the external jack that some phones have or in between your phone and your handset . When you take a call , just take the handset off the hook and set it on your table , and then push the button on the headset to pick it up . It works great.This headset has a 300 ' range , which is great if you have to move around while you talk . I 've walked down the hall to pick up a print job from the printer and never had any drop in call quality.I do have one complaint about the installation though . The jack where you plug in your handset cable is very difficult to access . There is a piece of plastic molding in front of it . They built a little plastic ramp to make it easier to slide the plug in , but it gets hung up on a plastic lip . It took me about 15 minutes of messing with it to finally get the plug into the jack . I was very close to giving up and returning the headset . I 'm glad I got it to work though .	1
After ordering the CS55 but before receiving it , I read the negative review `` Very cool but poor sound quality '' and was concerned about what I was going to receive . No worries ! Reading the instructions would resolve most of the reviewer 's problem with the unit , moving the mouthpiece away from his/her face would take care of the rest !	1
I use this headset at work and I only had this for a few months , after using it the over the head part that holds the Bluetooth broke in half where you adjust the size for your head , it snapped one day when taking it off my head , I am gon na get a replacement but they need to make it out of a better plastic . Other then that the sound it great , people on the other line can hear me crystal clear .	1
We finally tried the Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset and it is AWESOME ! We were using Plantronics CS50 headsets and they just give off feeback and crackle.The Plantronics CS-55 Dect 6.0 Digital Wireless Office Headset is really great , good sound quality , no feedback , no buzzing in your ear ! And people can actually hear you ! We have 7 wireless headsets working in our office and 2 are the CS-55 . Once the CS50 ones break ( which will be soon ) I will be replacing them all with the CS-55 !	1
Have been using this headset 3 years and it works great . I use it all day , 5 days a week and sound quality is great and it has held up very well . It is a very good quality headset for use all day long . It is comfortable as well . Have had zero problems with this unit	1
sony ericsson W600 reviewupdated note : phone has been sent back to the manufacturer twice now for bluetooth problems . upon thinking about this phone some more , i 'd say the software is buggy for a lot of people . please take this into consideration before buying.i bought this phone in early december for the oh-so-NOT-low price of $ 390 from letstalk.com . i was ( am ) only about seven months into my two-year contract , so yes , i paid full price . : eek : in my past , i 've owned most of the major brands of phones ( motorola , nokia , samsung , sony ericsson , sharp ) and right before i got this phone , i was a happy motorola V551 owner . initially , i had wanted the sony ericsson W800 , but without the 850mhz band and being a cingular customer , i was n't going to risk it.in short , i love this phone . to date , it 's the best phone i 've owned . i do n't think it 's worth the $ 390 i paid for it , but that 's really my fault . i 'm impatient and wanted this phone reeeeeally bad and did n't want to wait until it dropped in price ( if it ever will ) . i am going to cover a few of the major components to this phone and then list some pros and cons . mine is a cingular-branded phone , so keep that in mind when i talk about certain features.camera : i 've had a few camera phones before this one . i 'll preface this section by saying what 100s of others have said : it 's a camera PHONE . it 's not going to have the quality to make even a decent 4X6 print . what it IS good for are those moments where you 're thinking , `` oh ! i wish i had a camera right now ! '' . my last phone was a VGA camera and i thought by getting a phone with a 1.3 MP camera , it 'd be a noticable difference . it is n't really . however , the cameras on phones are such a relative subject since once person can think the pic looks good and others think it looks like total doodie . i would urge you to look at samples of pics this phone has taken and judge for yourself . i was n't too impressed , but that 's not why i bought the phone . the camera has a lot of neat little options ( special effects , white balance , shoot mode , night mode , self-timer , etc ) , but that 's all kinda lost when the pictures are n't that great . it should be noted that the camera on this phone and the sony ericsson S710a ( a phone very similar to the W600 ) are both 1.3MP , but the S710a has a CCD sensor , which results in better pics . the phone will also take little ( albeit grainy ) video clips . moving on ... bluetooth : does n't seem to be as easy to use as with my motorola , but i have some learning to do here . was what was cool was transferring ringtones from my friend 's SE T616 to mine via bluetooth . free ringtones for me ! i do n't have bluetooth on any of my PCs , so i can not comment on bluetooth connectivity in relation to that . i just like that the option ( bluetooth ) is there.walkman : holy crap , it 's a MP3 player on my phone ! the walkman is pretty easy to use and so is the software to transfer songs to your phone . it took me about 12 minutes to transfer 15 songs , so it 's not incredibly fast , but it 's a cool app , nonetheless . the phone can hold about 60-70 songs at 128bps ( ripping at other bitrates is possible , allowing more/less songs to be stored on the phone ) , depending on what other stuff you have on your phone ( pics , vids ) . the sound is pretty damn good . you can listen to MP3s from the speakers or via headphones . i was very impressed . the phone does NOT have a 3.5mm plug , but comes with an adapter , so all is well . i 've even plugged this phone into my car 's cassette adapter and played MP3s through the car 's stereo speakers . MP3s can also be used as ringtones . all-in-all , no complaints here ! well , except the 256MB limit.radio : nice little feature ! you HAVE to have the headset plugged in to listen to the radio , as it acts as the antenna , but while it 's plugged in , you can send the sound to come out of the speakers . radio is easy to use , channels are easy to store and radio sounds good . the radio ( as well as the MP3 player ) , will pause if you get a call and resume when you 're done . you can also use the radio and MP3 player while doing other things on the phone . headphones sound awesome.games : the phone came with six games : asphalt3D , blockbreaker , bruwnswick billiards , jewel quest , name that tune , tetris , and 3D extreme air snowboarding . all games are locked , so you can only play them for about a minute and then you are prompted to purchase them . they are $ 6- $ 8 , roughly . total rip off . thanks cingular.ringtones : again , thanks to cingular , there are only six ringtones that come with this phone , and they are pretty crappy . there are free ones all over the place , so do n't go spending your inheritance on buying them from cingular . or , do as i do and grab them off another SE phone via bluetooth . there is a little app including on the phone called musicDJ and you can actually make your own ringtones . kinda cool . i 've made a few so far and they are n't bad . well , ok , my mom said they sounded horrible , but what does she know ? syncing : this phone syncs with your contacts , tasks , notes and calendar , if you have those kinds of programs on your PC . i got my phone to sync with my outlook , which now means i 'll sell my PDA . SE 's PC suite works pretty well and transferring files is easy . however , it seems like every now and again , when i am connected via USB , it reboots my phone . do n't know what that 's about . i do n't think any harm is being done.the phone feels pretty solid in your hand , weight-wise . i 've never owned a slider/swivel phone in my life , and while it 's not the most convenient to `` flip '' open , it 's not bad . you can actually place and receive calls with the phone swivelled shut , too , which i liked.it seems like SE did n't leave anything out with this phone ( except a memory slot ) and i love it . they thought of everything on this phone : radio , little flash light , dedicated key lock button , infrared , calendar , music/video/picture DJ , stopwatch , timer , tasks , notes and the list goes on and on . the phone 's styling ( ie : orange cover ) is n't for everyone , but i love it . my phone did come with a 2nd cover , in navy blue . it 's styling and shape is great and i love the orange backlit keypad . it 's definitely a head-turner.and , above all , reception and clarity of calls is great . i 've had no complaints when i 've used the phone , the headset , the bluetooth headset and speakerphone . it 's really nice . this of course , can be dependent on your network . i live in the midwest in a fairly large area ( 260K people ) , so we have cell towers all over the place.pros : * nice size . * bluetooth , infrared and speakerphone . * radio and MP3s* clarity of calls is excellent . reception is great . * screen is nice and bright . * easy to get pics , vids , etc . on and off the phone . * phone comes with everything you need ( except car charger ) * this phone is loaded - nothing is left out ! * sony ericsson 's interface is great ; apps like the address book are loaded with room for tons of info . menus are easy to use.cons : * no memory slot . on-board memory , while not bad , is limited to 256MB . * price ( well , at full retail anyway ) . * camera is disappointing for a 1.3MP . * phone goes into standby ( screen off ) after 15 seconds . very annoying and to date , i 've found no way to change that . * games are locked for only 1 minute of play . thanks cingular ; ( not ONE free game is included . * keypad buttons are small , and close together . i have small hands , so the key size is not so bad , it 's the fact that they are right next to each other.this is a great phone . its big disappointment is the fixed 256MB memory , but for a lot of people who just want to listen to a few songs and not 500 , this phone will suit you just fine . i am hoping to keep this phone for more than six months ( which is about how often i get a new cell phone ) - it has everything i need and nothing i do n't . kudos to sony ericsson for putting out a great phone ! woo ! ; )	1
I did a lot of research on phones before finally settling on the W600i phone . I really did n't need an MP3 player as I usually carry a PDA with me as well , but the features on this phone were just too good to pass up . I considered a Motorola RAZR but saw a lot of complaints about battery life . Well , no problems here ! I 've previously been using a SE T616 which had superb battery life , and this phone is equally as good . Which is certainly important if you do plan to use it as a music player.First things first ... entering phone numbers . So tedious on most phones , and something I always dread . Thankfully , the W600i came with software to sync with Outlook . It took me a little while to figure out the syncing software . When you hook the phone up to USB , it can go into phone mode or file mode and for some reason the software always tells me it ca n't find the phone if it is in file mode . So to sync , I had to put it in phone mode . Turns out file mode was used only for transferring MP3s . Still tells me it ca n't find the phone , yet the transfer did work ! Sometimes when I plug it in , my computer wo n't see it without rebooting , which cost me a lot of time and aggravation trying to figure out as well . So somewhat annoying implementation here , but such a time saver , and something I 've never had before at all with a phone , so it 's hard to gripe . I usually do n't bother to put appointments and tasks on my cell phone , but since they just sync with Outlook , now that 's easy to do as well . This may not be a SmartPhone , but it could replace a PDA for casual users.The MP3 player is decent enough . Sound quality was much better than I expected . Then I tried the built-in FM radio . Wow , awesome reception here ! The cord acts as an antennae so you have to be sure to unwind it for best results , but considering how far from the stations I am , I was quite impressed with how nice it sounded . Some simple equalizer settings , nothing special . Only gripe would be the lack of an external memory card , there 's certainly room for one so it should have been added . I guess Sony 's proprietary Memory Stick would be large to squeeze in , so rather than add a SD slot , they just left it out completely . Booo to that.Phone data features worked great . I got even better reception on the W600i than my T616 and now also have Edge . Had no problems using Bluetooth to connect up to my PDA and laptop , and speeds were pretty nice . The Media Net services worked fast and there were some nice demo services included as well . Not sure I will pay for these but definitely worth considering.Camera is better than most cell phone cameras I have used , but still nothing great . The pseudo-flash is at least an attempt to improve indoor shots but any real camera still beats the pants off it . You can even use the little flash-light as an SOS beacon if you get lost . ; - ) Even better is the image import included with the PC software . Was nice to easily copy over GOOD photos to use for my contacts.To use the keypad , you have to swivel the back of the camera down . It makes a cool little sound and lights up , but it 's not the easiest motion to do one-handed and will also make getting a decent playthrough case a lot harder than other phones . The buttons are easy to press though , an improvement over my old T616 . There are also a couple buttons at the top of the screen that confused me as to their function ( of course , I do n't bother with manuals ! ) I did figure out that they were used when playing games in landscape mode . Neat idea . There were a couple bugs in the OS as well . When using voice dial , an misrecognized command results in a really weird and annoying sound coming from the phone . And the voice command symbols in the address book are very buggy ... appearing and disappearing from the contacts that do n't have them . Hopefully a phone firmware upgrade will fix these.This is the first cell phone I 've had with a real speakerphone . You really can use it without having to hold it up to your ear ... assuming you are someplace it wo n't disturb other users . You can play music through the speaker as well , and use those MP3s as alarms and phone sounds , so lots of things to play with here . For some reason a lot of the phone tones you can buy through Cingular are not available for this phone yet , but hopefully they will get those working soon . I also had trouble downloading a couple games I purchased.Some users have reported issues with using bluetooth headsets , particularly with voice control . I 'm not a fan of having another device I have to charge all the time , so I prefer using a regular handfree . And this phone actually comes with one for free ! The headphones double as a handsfree headset in addition to the FM antennae , so it 's well worth carrying and using over a bluetooth headset , IMO.I was able to get both my PDA and my laptop to pair up with it and use it as a modem for internet connection , although my laptop was a bit flaky and did require a bluetooth upgrade and reboot to get it working . Great speed difference with the Edge network ! According to Windows , I was getting 400Kbps , with my old phone it was usually around 100Kbps . The phone has a nice `` E '' symbol that tells you when you are on Edge , and `` G '' for regular GPRS . Even in my house out here in the country I am able to get Edge , which was a pleasant surprise . I have n't traveled much yet , but it looks like they already have pretty good coverage , and metro areas in particular should n't be an issue.So , this may not be the smallest , lightest phone out there . There are definitely some issues like the weird swivel design , voice dial bugs and lack of memory card support that may be cause for complaint . But if your priorities are a phone with great battery life , excellent reception , Edge and bluetooth , and easy to use , this one should definitely be at the top of your list . If you do n't already have a portable MP3/FM player , I do n't see how you could even consider anything else ! I 've yet to find the perfect phone , but this one comes so close to it and is so much better than the other phones I 've had , I have to give it 5 stars .	1
First , the White Screen of Death Issue . I had 3 units til instead of returning tp Cingular . I sent it back to SONY . NO more problems . They flashed it with the latest firmware and it works fine . The WOD will seem to occur after you disconnect after a file transfer . However , wait 20 seconds and the phone reboots.Pro : Loud and easy to hear from.Con : Buttons and keypad is hard to get use to.Pro : The camera is fine for a phone cam.Con : Battery drain is bad , when you play the MP3 player .	1
This phone has grown on me . At first I was n't sure I needed all this stuff , it felt a bit heavy , I was unsure of the swivel design , and I felt guilty for buying such an expensive phone . But now I know I 'd buy it again . It 's still a little heavy ( compared to the Razr , which was my other choice ) but the reception is great , it has lots of functions , and the interface is easy to navigate . Best of all , the speaker phone function is one of the best I 've ever heard . It 's loud and clear .	1
I 've had a Blackberry since the first one came out and I *love* the new 8700 series . It 's sleeker , faster , and as functional as ever . I recommend the T-Mobile version however because the rate plans are much better at about half what Cingular charges .	1
I changed jobs , and the corporate standard is the Blackberry , so I had to give up my much-loved Treo 650 . At least I was able to keep my number and swap the old SIM into the new phone.Overall I 'm fairly happy with the 8700c . I miss the five-way joystick : navigating in Google Maps is a bit awkward . ( Alt+scrollwheel for side-to-side ) . The keyboard is OK , but `` . '' should have a dedicated key . I find the phone sound OK , although some people that I call report high noise levels.The biggest issue is switching between silent/vibrate and ring modes . The Treo gets this right : there is a simple , easily visible , sliding switch . You can see instantly what mode you 're in , and can switch into silent mode without even removing the Treo from its holster.On the Blackberry I have to unlock it ( using my password ) and get back to the main menu screen just to SEE what mode I 'm in ( interpreting a small multicoloured icon ) . If I need to switch modes I then have to scroll to the Profiles applet , select it , choose the right profile , and apply it - a total of 15-20 key presses and wheel scroll events . This simply sucks . Since I try to be polite and avoid phone interruptions during meetings , I wind up leaving the device on vibrate only , which means that occasionally I miss a call.RIM really needs to fix this . I ca n't imagine that anyone else has patented the idea of a `` mute '' switch ... .UPDATE , 2/10/07 : The usability issues that I mentioned , plus the lack of third-party applications finally got to me . My employer just added support for Windows Mobile devices , so I 've replaced my 8700c with a Cingular 8525 .	1
If you want good phone capabilities and email , then this is the phone for you . I have had many smart phones which had a camera , MP3 player , ability to do excel , etc and found these phones to be slow and inferior to the Blackberry . While it takes a little while getting used to it , once you do , it is a much faster device than any other phone for emailing and texting .	1
The Blackberry 8700 is wonderful ! It does a great job of retrieving email from all five of my accounts , and functions well as a phone and PDA . I am thrilled.Until two weeks ago , I was carrying around a top of the line Dell Axim X30 with 624 MHZ and wireless capability , and a cell phone . I teach at several universities and do consulting work so I have five different email accounts and I 'm constantly checking my email at least twice an hour . Prior to getting this Blackberry , I had to find a wireless spot to use my Axim , stay tied to my laptop , or pay out the nose for web access on my cell phone . It was terrible.Now with the Blackberry , all of my email accounts are programmed in so I 'm instantly notified when I get a message . Because I can respond within seconds , I never miss a beat . My students and clients often comment that I respond quickly to their needs , which they love . The 8700 from Cingular has GSM and dual band service so I can be almost anywhere in the world and still receive my email messages instantly . I was in Hong Kong last week and the Blackberry functioned flawlessly . I could use it as a phone in HK and also receive and reply to email.Additionally , I love the fact that I can synch my MS Outlook calendar , contacts , address book , tasks , etc . to the Blackberry . ( It also has the ability to synch with other PIM programs . ) I have mine set to sound an alarm 15 mins before I 'm due in a meeting or appt and it has been a life saver . When you are always on the go , it 's easy to forget stuff . This Blackberry makes it easy to keep everything in one place . Oh , and surfing the web is a breeze . The display is a nice size and it 's crisp and clear and shows almost all websites easily.Lastly , I love the size of the 8700 . I thought it would be a bit bulky but it 's not . This version is about the same size as the 7290 Blackberry and fits nicely in your hand.My only two complaints are that some of the buttons and functions are not immediately intuitive , and RIM has yet to come out with an assortment of cases for this version . But , after about 15 mins of playing around , I was able to figure out just about everything ( the manual that RIM provides covers only the basics ) , and I found a great case on eBay.I only wish I had discovered Blackberry sooner !	1
Pretty much the same features as the 7290 but with a great screen and speakerphone.Pros : -Screen is perfect.-Speaker phone is the best I have ever heard.-Call quality and volume is excellent-The 2 short cut keys and call keys are a great edition.-Nice form factor.Cons : -Nothing really new added.-Battery life is crap.-No `` option '' for camera-Internet has EDGE but to be honest there is no noticable diff in speed . Maybe a sec or two . Get EV-DO if you want speed.-Internet software has problems surfing and opening some links.-The case of the 7290 and build quality is in my mind what made it so popular . When they came out with the 7100 series it was a joke . The first of the series anyway . No experience with the newer ones.The 8700c is well made but has two major problems . One the screen is moved up to the surface of the phone ( not indented ) . The screen also is smoothed out and extends to the top of the phone . Making a nice slick look but easy to scratch in the long run.The 2nd major build quality issue is the grey casing . Why phone companies do this is a mystery to me . Its not the fact that its grey but the fact that the actual case is black but painted grey . So cany scratch or dent will show black on the grey case . Makes it stand out more . I have dropped and beat up my 7290 so much but none of this really shows . If you are new to blackberry or have to buy another one this 8700c is it . But if you have a working older model its not worth the upgrade.Also check out the Treo 700w although not sure how the push email compares with blackberry yet .	1
I often hear debates over who has the better smartphone -- - Palm or BlackBerry ? ? I have two lines with Sprint PCS , with my personal line having a Treo 700p and my business line connected to a BlackBerry 8703First off - I love both phones ! However , they are very different , particularly in their strengths and weaknesses -- - my review is based upon how well each smartphone handles the following things -- PHONE FUNCTIONS- EMAIL- INTERNET- PHOTOGRAPHS- MULTIMEDIA ( Music & Movies ) - SPEAKERPHONE- BLUETOOTH- COMPUTER SYNCHRONIZATION- MISC - ( Text Messaging , System Stability , PDA Functions ) Okay ... .. here we go -1 . PHONE FUNCTIONSFor me , the Treo 700p has much better phone functions -- - this is mostly because of their touch screen capabilitiesWhen I wan na dial a number off of the Treo , I immediately start spelling the person 's name on the keyboard , and I immediately go to my phone book , where I can touch the number I want to dialThe BlackBerry is a bit more complicated , as I can not touch the screen -- - therefore , I 'm limited to dialing based upon scrolling to the right name and then pressing the numberOverall , the BlackBerry is n't bad -- -- however , I know a lot of people like to use their phone while driving their car ( with a bluetooth headset on ) or like to use the phone in situations that require a quick reaction ... . if you wan na use your phone in the car , then the Treo is the best choice , mainly because the touch screen allows one to go to any name and dial immediately -- - as funny as this sounds , you can really only use a BlackBerry , for phone calls , in situations when you can give it total devotionWith that said ... . if you are not dialing numbers while driving in the car , then the BlackBerry 's phone functions are fine ... . they take a bit longer to get going , due to scrolling ... . but they get the job done just fine ( and yes , you can use the keyboard to look up names in the address book , as well ) 2 . EMAILOkay - this is really the only category where the BlackBerry really beats up the Treo 700 and beats it up GOOD ! ! ! First off , email on the Treo 700p is no totally useless ... . the Treo comes with VersaMail , a program that handles all POP , IMAP , and other email accounts with ease ... .. there 's also a program available called CHATTER EMAIL for the Treo , which makes the Treo 's email functions even faster and more versatileHowever , the big problem with Treo email is that one has to download the email -- - in other words , you have to log onto ChatterMail or VersaMail and wait for a few mins as the program downloads all of the email you 've received -- - now you can configure a program like ChatterMail to be constantly downloading your email , so one receives it immediately , however this is a BAD choice because such a function basically keeps the Treo on a 'constant ' phone call , as it downloads email -- - in turn , your cell phone mins get eaten up , battery life goes down quickly , and phone calls are missed do to your phone being occupied on the 'other line'THe BlackBerry , on the other hand , downloads all of your emails immediately , without draining the battery , without interrupting phone calls , and without eating up your cell phone mins -- - my BlackBerry can download my emails more immediately than my own laptopIn addition , the BlackBerry 8703 keyboard is absolutely awesome -- - so I much more prefer to write emails over my BlackBerry than I do over my Treo 700pIn summary on this one , the BlackBerry is clearly much better with email ... . and if email is the most important thing to you , then go BlackBerry for sure ! -- - however , the Treo 700p holds its own with email , provided that you are willing to wait and download your emails over something like Chatter or Versamail3 . INTERNETBoth phones handle internet similarly , however , I would give the edge to the Treo 700p mostly because of the TOUCHSCREEN , as it allows one to navigate webpages with more freedomThat said , the BlackBerry is fien too , just a bit more limitedBoth phones can connect your laptop to the internet , depending on your cell service -- - I 've been very pleased with the Treo 's ability to connect my laptop to the internet , provided that I use its USB cable with the program USB MODEM -- -- - I do n't have as much experience doing this with my BlackBerry , but I have heard that the results are favorable when doing soEVDO speeds on both phones are very good4 . PHOTOGRAPHSIf pictures are important , then the Treo 700p is the CLEAR winnerThe Treo 700p comes with a great multimedia program , fueld by an embedded Kinoma player , which can allow you to show off pictures with pretty good easeI 'm a Mac user , so I use MarkSpace to get my pics onto my Treo and I 'm very pleased with the Treo 's ability to show off pictures -- - the resolution and quality are shown off very wellI have yet to get pictures onto my BlackBerry though -- - I have seen other friends of mine show off pictures on their BlackBerry , but the program does not seem as sophisticated or as user friendly as Palm'sClearly , the Treo 700p is made to handle pics , whereas the BlackBerry is lagging in this area5 . MULTIMEDIA ( Movies/Music ) I am actually DEEPLY impressed with how well the Treo 700p can handle multimedia , both music and moviesI am a filmmaker myself -- - with the use of the program , KINOMA PRODUCER , I have compressed many of my short films to small files , for the purposes of showing them off of my Treo to some friends -- - the Treo 700p plays the files excellently , with sound coming out of the speakerphone and the resolutions of the films looking excellent ! Even better is that the Treo 700p can handle MP4 's and MPEG4 's , allowing me to encode the best resolution and best sounding files onto my Treo -- -- sadly , the Treo 700p can not play songs downloaded from the iTunes Music Store , as those are copyright protected , but it will play anything that one encodes with my own devicesThe music/mp3 player on the Treo is also excellent , playing tunes through the speakerphone , or through the headphones that the Treo comes withAs far as I can tell , the BlackBerry 8703 does not have any multimedia functions , so good luck getting an MP4 or MPEG4 onto this thing -- -- however , Blackberry is working on this , so future BlackBerry 's will have this capability -- - but if playing movies and music is important to you , then the Treo 700p is the only choice in this departmentLastly - important to include that the Treo 700p also has a built in camera and a built in camcorder -- - and the camcorder movies taken on the Treo are actually pretty good quality ! -- - the BlackBerry 8703 has no camera and no camcorder6 . SPEAKERPHONEThe Speakerphone on both phones is excellent and easy to use , with both being loud and clearIf speakerphone is your main buying point , then you could n't go wrong with either phone7 . BLUETOOTHBluetooth is very solid on both phonesI 've been especially pleased with the Treo 700p , whose BlueTooth capabilities are much more solid and stable than the old Treo 650pThe BlackBerry seems to have few problems connecting with my bluetooth headset and other devices -- -- I would say that both phones boast great bluetooth capabilities8 . COMPUTER SYNCHROIt 's important to note that I have a MAC and I sync all my phones off of my MacFor the Treo 700p , I use MarkSpace 's Missing Sync , as Palm 's software is terribleFor the BlackBerry , BB has launched free Mac-Syncing software , that can be found on their websiteSyncing any smartphone off of a Mac is never an easy thing and I 've not been too happy with the processWith that said , I 'm pleased with MarkSpace 's Missing Sync as , for the most part , the program does a good job of syncing my Treo 's contacts and calendars , as well as doing photos and music -- - unfortunately , the syncing process seems to take forever ( usually at least 35 mins ) but syncing once a week is n't a big dealI was pleased with how well the BlackBerry synced to my Mac , however , none of the email addresses for my contacts have transferred -- - so there are some kinks to work out , and it could be that I 'm just not syncing it rightMain point - both phones sync fine with the Mac , but expect some minor probs -- - however , for what its worth , I 'm pretty satisified overall9 . MISC - ( Text Messaging , System Stability , PDA Functions ) It is important to note that the BlackBerry is MUCH MORE stable than the Treo 700p -- - I have had my BlackBerry shut down on me once in the last few months , whereas the Treo 700p probably shuts down once a weekSo if stability is important , than the BlackBerry is the way to goThe calendar and address book functions of both phones are excellent , but I would say that the Treo 700p 's PDA functions are a 'bit ' betterBoth phones are fine with text messaging , as well -- - CONCLUSION -- -If I could only use ONE of these phones , then I would definitely pick the Treo 700p -- - the reasons why are because the multimedia functions very much impress me , as I like to store some pics and movies on thereIn addition , the phone functions are easier to navigate and the touchscreen is something that I could n't live without on a daily basis -- - text messaging , bluetooth , and PDA functions are all excellent , as well , with email being the only thing that lags ( but even that 's not so bad ) However , I love the BlackBerry 's solid system and its excellent email performanceHaving one as my personal cellphone and the other as my business setup is the perfect balance -- - however , I would give the slight edge to the Treo 700pWith that said -- - if you want multimedia and other phone functions , in addition to better phone functions , then the Treo 700p is your phoneIf you are all business and clearly value EMAIL over multimedia , then the BlackBerry may be your best betHope that helpsPEACE AND LOVE & HAPPY BUYING ! ! ! !

This is my first blackberry . How I got along without it all this time I have no idea . Earpiece quality sounds great , speaker phone sounds great , microphone sounds great . The overall layout is quite genius . I love all the programmable features and the bluetooth accessories are a must . Web browsing with EDGE technology is surprisingly fast . If you text message often as I do , the keyboard and the `` auto-text '' features are amazing . I literally send text messages 10 times faster than I used to . If you live by email as I do , ( 90 % of my clients orders are placed through email ) , receiving them instantly is so important . No more running back to the office or home to check for orders . I highly recommend this product .	1
I 've been using some form of Blackberry ever since the early days of the 950/957 . This latest version is a great step up in terms of usability but really no huge functional differences from earlier models.Recently I swapped my Blackberry 7100i for the 8700C.If you spend a lot of time using your Blackberry device , then you definitely want to upgrade to the 8700C : PROS-Better screen ( on par with the 7100 ) -Version 4.1 O/S-Can load MP3 ringtones-Better call notification settings-Faster web browsing ( though not lightning fast ) CONS-The data speeds are not lightning fast-Requires a Blackberry Data Plan ( lots of new buyers do n't realize that you must have a BB specific plan in addition to your regular phone plan ) -Batter life is just ok-Some quirkiness in the 4.1 O/S-ExpensiveOverall the bright screen and the slightly faster web browsing make this a really nice upgrade for anyone who is a serious BB user . Currently only one carrier is offering this phone , however search around and you can find services that will allow you to enter a number to open it up to other GSM based carriers ( which is what I did ) and make full use of their network and your existing plan/sim card .	1
The Galaxy S3 is a great phone , but its finish is very slippery , and the phone is too easy to drop . This case solves that problem inexpensively , and without adding a lot of bulk . The volume and power keys are harder to operate than without the case , though . That 's a good thing for the power button , as it prevents accidental power-ons . It 's not as good for the volume control , though . But it 's well worth the price.Note that in order to get the holes to line up right , I had to put the volume control side of the phone in the case first , then stretch the case over the power button side of the phone .	1
I have bought at least half a dozen cases for my s3 . I think I have finally found my favorite , and one that may make me stop looking for something better . I feel my phone is protected in this case , and all the buttons work properly with it on . I especially like the matted back . Makes the phone feel as sleek as it does without a case . I would recommend this case to a friend .	1
was looking for a simple , classic , BLACK case . theres lots of flat/matte black cases out there but i liked this one because it has a lil black gloss trim and that helps the phone slide in and out of my pocket easily . great case for the price . perfect fit too .	1
Ear Pieces for Voyager worked great . Helped with the fit for my ear and they were very comfortable . They are good quality and lasted right up to the point the voyager quit working . If only the voyager was as good quality as these ear pieces , I would still be using them .	1
the wind screen works great ... the ear buds work , they are the same as the original , they arent just the foam piece , its the whole adapter ... .. i 'm buying 5 more packages before they quit making them for my 3 510 's and my friends that use 510 's ...	1
I bought this to replace the tip on the voyager I sometimes use . It fit perfectly , and works as advertised . If you 're looking to replace the tips on your voyager , this is it !	1
Great factory replacement parts for Plantronics PLT 510 . Ear cushions with O rings fit tight with no problems . The new foam cushion feels great on the ear . My old earpiece had a black covering that was coming off in my ear . The windscreen is great too for the microphone . Makes your bluetooth like new again .	1
I stupidly left myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [ Retail Packaging ] in my car too long before realizing how the sun and heat were going to expedite the disintegration process of the foam covering of the earpiece . I do n't use my Bluetooth earpiece often , so when I did go to use it , the soft foam just crumbled in my hand . I was irritated with myself because I had no idea where to get a replacement foam covering.I should have remembered all the times Amazon has come to the rescue ! When I found this foam replacement set , I was delighted because buying it would address another , nagging problem I 've had -- the Plantronics headset picks up any slight breeze and makes it intolerable for the person on the other end of the phone conversation . So , buying this set let me replace the eartip PLUS add a windscreen to the speaker boom , too.Putting on the eartip cover was tough because it 's a TIGHT fit , and you wonder if you 're going to tear the eartip in the process ( I did n't ) . Putting on the windscreen on the speaker boom was not as difficult , but it also was a tight fit . I did have the speaker boom windscreen fall off once when I was transporting the headset around in my pocket.What 's really nice is that still have left-over pieces to this set that I can do another repair job in the future ( as long as I remember where I stowed these pieces ! ) .Highly recommended !	1
I picked this up on Amazon for under $ 20 after months of thinking about buying one . My needs are small ; I 'm not on the phone all that much , but in the car a lot . I 'm also not overly picky . If it works ... I 'm happy.The Motorola is small ; about 2.5 '' long and yet it seems to pick up my voice quite well and the sound quality on my calls thus far has been good . Better than on my Nokia phone ! The earpiece is adjustable , and fits my ear very well.The packaging on this item was kind of weird . Plastic baggie with the charger , bluetooth headset and directions . I guess I expected a box ? The unit charged fully in about 2 hours . My Nokia phone picked it up just fine once I enabled the bluetooth to find it.All things considered , for the price I paid and what it does . I 'm happy with the purchase . The true test will be the item 's durability and battery life , which only time will tell .	1
I gave this headset to my wife and she uses it all the time . Works great and is comfortable .	1
Well , it 's a good little bluetooth for the money.. I 've only had a couple times when it 's cut out on me and not worked right , but 3/4 of the time it works beautifully and people do n't even know I 'm on it ! I think the times that I did cut out was because I was too close to metallic objects.. pipes and things.. so.. that sounds like a good excuse..eh ? Works good for me , and is cute and small , fits like a dream , good battery life.. all in all is a good bluetooth .	1
I like this bluetooth headset . It is a bit heavy and the headset does not stay in your ear , it dangles . You can use it in your left or right ear . The audio is pretty clear but , people can barely hear me when there is wind and other noises so , the noise cancellation is not that good .	1
First of all I just want to say , this low cost Bluetooth headset is a great value . There are a lot of Bluetooth heasets to choose from on the market today . Many are more stylish and have more bells and whistles , but for under $ 30.00 this headset is one of the best values out there . This pink version is very cute and offers a perfect color match for the Versizon V3 series Motorola Pink Razr . However , I believe the gentle pink color is the only stylish element of this headset . Take away the pink and you are left with a very generic looking earpiece.Now lets talk about performance . The H500 could n't be eaiser to use . It paired with my daughter 's Verizon Motorola Pink Razr in just seconds , and the button configuration of this unit makes perfect sense . The buttons have gentle action yet offer a satisfying `` click '' feel when pushing them ; not mushy feeling at all . The sound quality of the speaker is quite good but not acceptional . The voice quality of the microphone is very impressive . When I am on the phone with my daughter , she actually sounds much better with this headset than when using the Razr phone alone . It does tend to pickup a great deal of background noise though , so it may not be the best in noisey environments . The H500 sits in a very stable manner on my daughters ear . The ear hook is soft and flexible and can be worn for extended periods without discomfort . It does not look or feel as if it will fall off your ear even when tipping your head.I am giving this headset a full 5 stars . I do not rate the H500 so highly for its outstanding style , but rather for its simple functionality , solid performance , great build quality and overall value for the money . You just ca n't get a better Bluetooth headset for under $ 30.00 ! I highly recommend this headset for any woman that is looking for a cute color match to her Verizon Moto Razr , while also seeking a comfortable fit and impressive performance . There may be better looking headsets out there , but you 'll likely suffer penalties in cost and/or performance .	1
Light weight and simple to use . My charger was bad but AGFA Store sent me a new one very fast .	1
5 stars if it fit more in the ear than on it . There 's a gap between it and the ear when it 's on . That does n't seem to affect call quality or volume but it feels a little floppy that way.It does probably make wearing it for a long time more comfortable . It is small enough to forget about and since your ear is n't plugged the outside noises sound like it 's not there.For the problem where the mic gets blocked , I 've noticed that the more horizontal I make it , the more it sits off the face . If I turn it so that it is more vertical it moves the mic closer to the skin . But that 'll vary by user due to ear shape.Pairing with my Razr was very easy . I tried with a V600 as well and again no problems . Call quality is good and I can walk into the next room and still have no problems with the call . Have n't tested the max effective range , but I can walk around the aparment and it does seem to meet specifications . My Razr is impossible to hear in a noisy environment but if I use this headset I have n't had any problems . Seems to be ok on the other end as well .	1
This is one of the best purchases I 've made on-line . The H700 is a big upgrade for me ( previously used the H500 ) . No complaints whatsoever . Love the fact I can turn off the headset by just closing it . I have a small face & small ears -- this dainty piece is perfect !	1
Compact , stylish , and very comfortable . Currently one of the only headsets known to work well with the HTC Mogul . I wear it all day and never run out of my charge , and sometimes even forget that I am wearing it because it is so lighweight and comfortable . Amazon has top pricing on this product too . I could buy two here for what I 'd pay full retail elsewhere . Sound is clear on both my end and the receiver 's end . Great product and great value .	1
Overall , while this is n't the best headset in the world , it seems to work fine . It 's a bit overpriced for what it is , but not too bad of a value . My report card : Design : A- , flip-boom works well , but not as advertised ( see below ) . Buttons are few and easy to use , main button is a bit sensitive . USB charging is a real plus.Aesthetics : A , like most Moto products , it 's an attractive piece ( though a bit odd ) . Some color options would be welcome.Build quality : A , it 's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort : B+ , it 's lightweight , but the ear clip pinches a bit . ( The old HS850 was actually a bit more comfortable . ) Stablity of fit is very good but not perfect.Compatibility : B+ , no problems pairing . `` Flip '' boom connects / disconnects quickly , but only when your ( non-Motorola ) phone is in standby mode ; the stated `` RapidConnect technology '' for answering calls appears to be a Motorola-only feature . Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use . However , it occasionally emits a soft beep that has yet to be resolved.Outbound sound quality : B+ , callers can hear me fine , but some have complained of a `` speakerphone '' quality to the sound . Decent noise cancellation with no echo.Inbound sound quality : B- , volume is improved and adequate , but could be a bit louder still for noisy environments . Incoming voices are clear but lack bass . Minimal static .	1
Very good . Good battery life , nice mini-USB charging port ( convenient ) , decent sound quality on both ends . Just a bit of crackling , not quite as strong as some other bluetooth signals , when arm or body in the path of the headset and device . And perhaps a little annoying that the bluetooth light is so big and prominent . Also , the button may be a little too easy to press , if it 's in the pocket or a case , when you do n't want it pressed .	1
I 've spent the last two weeks ordering and returning bluetooth headsets . Finally , after going through quite a few models ( Motorola H350 , Motorola H500 , the Plantronics 655 , the NX6000 ) , I found a GREAT one . I was willing to pay up to $ 150 for a headset that was comfortable , easy to use , and -- most importantly -- that my callers did n't complain about . This headset has great sound quality on both ends , and the setup and buttons are very easy to use . The boom folds out , and the headset turns on . You fold it back , and the headset turns off . Several of the headsets I tried had TERRIBLE buttons -- small and hard to work without looking in a mirror . These are great.I was really looking forward to writing this review tonight as I 'm hoping I can help someone else avoid all the research I did ( CNET , endless googling ) only to find this one through trial and error.Look no further , you 've found a great headset ! BUY IT NOW ! ( and no , I do n't work for Motorola ! ! haha )	1
This H700 replaces an HS810 , it is smaller , lighter and seems to work just as well with similar battery life . It cost less too !	1
I previously owned an H300 and was impressed with the quality for the price . When I lost the H300 I decided to try the H700 . I was most interested in the improved sound quality and the fit around the ear . In those two areas the H700 is definitely an improvement over the H300 . I did not use the voice activated commands , so I can not speak to that , but I do see where that could be useful.Overall I do see the H700 as an improvement over the H300 . My only problem with it , which is why I did not give it 5 stars , was the Bluetooth drop out . It seems that the Bluetooth on the H700 drops out more often than the H300 . I would say that it drops out on 1 in every 20 calls .	1
I expect it has lots of room for improvement , but being my first Bluetooth ear piece , and from what I have read of other units , it is good . It works fine and sounds fine , and does it being ON my ear and not IN my ear , which I appreciate.It seems there must be a little easier way to get it on my ear but I have not found it , but once on it stays in place and is comfortable , more than can be said for other models from what I read . I assume too that it will be dated in a few years as it is twice as thick as I would have wanted it to be.Lastly , if anything Looked like a button it is the chromey little `` M button '' next to the larger oval do-all button with the ambiguous `` 1950 's receiver '' symbol ... that round M button was not referenced in any diagram or mentioned in the book so I decided it was for decoration . I tried pressing it too to make sure . Is it a future button ? or past ? silly and confusing . Very silly.The unit works fine , I hear the callers , the callers seem fine with it , of course technologically it is a `` marvel '' ; tho easier to get on , thinner , and less glitzy would be my wishes.ps Tho listed as silver , what I received was the shiney `` graphite '' which I was happy to discover , as it then was a Perfect match to my new `` tinted dark chrome '' ( shiney graphite ) MotoCRZR , so I lucked out there . And the `` bulked packaged '' thing sounded a bit scary , but what I got was great and supposedly saved some Bucks !	1
I read a lot of reviews on a lot of headsets before purchasing this one . I 've had it for a month now and so far the performance is just fine . I use it mostly in the car with no problems . People tell me they can hear me just fine . The battery life is good ; the lights on the headset are helpful indicators . I like the small lightweight size.My wife tried it out and was pleased with it . So I 've purchased a red one for her ... .she 'll get it for Christmas .	1
... I have it paired with my RAZR V3 phone . Sound quality is excellent , both receiving and sending . It is loud enough that I can hear in my rather noisy car without a problem . No one I 've talked to has complained about the sending sound quality at all -- most did n't know I was using a headset . Pairing was simple and worked according to the instructions.The headset fits me well , does n't have any problem with my glasses , is n't particularly noticable when I 'm wearing it . The buttons are logical and work well.The charger is the same as the RAZR charger ( same voltage/current and connector ) , so now I have two chargers that can be used with either device ... and can charge the headset using the car charger I got with the RAZR . This is very handy ! I think that the charger compatability should seal the deal for RAZR users -- in my opinion , this is definitely the Bluetooth headset to get if you have a RAZR.The only negative is that the manual , like the manual for my RAZR phone , is imcomplete . For instance , although the container says that you can pair with up to eight devices , I could not figure out how to pair with additional devices , nor how to switch between devices . I wish Motorola would invest in the writing and production of proper manuals -- or at least to make the full manual accessible on the web , if they do n't want to clutter the manual for most people with features most folks wo n't use.Oh ... and I 'd also like to be able to wear the thing without having to put it in Standby mode ... but given how little energy Standby mode uses , that 's not a really big deal . Perhaps if Motorola made the microphone boom switch always switch the headset off , but not switch it on unless you press the big button , at least as an option .	1
I had a H500 but when it stoped working I went to get the H700 and I like it much better . Sound a quality is as good if not better than the H500 And the H700 has some better features than the H500 now if it would only I can listen to my MP3 sounds from it with my Razor it would be that much better	1
Recently purchased a Razr v3 . Have tried several headsets without luck.HS805 Uses a battery , but had the best soundHS815 - OKH300 - poor - low volumeM500 - very poor - lower than the 300 , beepsHS850 - good design , poor volume ( again , too low ) highest setting , constantly beepsPlantronics 640 - a joke , falls apart in your hand . Little pieces everywhere.The H700 - Finally a good quality headset ! Callers have no problems hearing me ... I have no problem hearing them while on the road . I have a quiet car , but always found myself pressing a headset into my ear in order to hear conversations . Not the case with the H700 . This thing has volume galore ! In fact , I had to bump it down a few ticks , works great at highway speeds . It 's comfortable ... ( unbelievably light ) you think the 850 is small ... . the 700 is truly 30 % smaller as Moto claims . When closed , this thing can hide behind a .50 cent piece . Buttons are easy to operate by feel . Anyone who uses a headset regularly knows that adjusting opposing buttons can be challenging - Not with the H700 . There is a place top or bottom to rest a finger if you need to adjust up or down easily . Pairing and setup took 1 minute . Sound for me is crystal clear . This thing has all the bells and whistles . Works as promised right out of the box . 4 stars for design and operation . One plug home or car fits all , 5 stars for a top notch product .	1
I purchased this bluetooth headset for two main reasons . First , it uses the same charger as both my Motorola Razr and RIM Blackberry 8700C . Secondly the device easily turns on and off each time you extend the microphone.I 've used about 1/2 dozen other bluetooth headsets and this is one of my favorites.Here are my summarized pros and cons : PROS : -Uses the same charger as other Motorola RAZR phones-Open/Close microphone to turn headset on/off-Small , lightweight and easy to put on ( one handed eve ) CONS : -Only connects to one BT device at a time . I have both a RAZR and Blackberry that I carry with me everywhere . With these two devices I can not have the H700 connect simultaneously ( other Bluetooth products - notably the Plantronics ) are able to connect simultaneously to two devices.I recommend this headset , and Amazon has the most competitive pricing available . Easily beating even the discount superstores where I 'd seen this for 50 % more .	1
IMHO this is slightly better than the Moto HS850 . It 's smaller , and lighter . The boom is smaller . But if that 's not an issue , then both are equal IMHO.Now for the problem where people can not hear you , or you sound muffled or away from the phone . Wearing your bluetooth , look in the mirror and see how the boom touches your cheek or if you have a beard it 'll touch that . Note there is a very small hole on the inside of the boom that gets the sound . Now anything that touches that will impede your voice ... .it 's like putting a towel over a regular phone and talking to someone . Not you do not need puffy cheeks for this problem to happen . Unless you have a very narrow face , chances are this will happen to you and you 'll blame it on the bluetooth ! TO fix this , get either Neoprene tubing or that sticky foam on one end ( mole skin ) and cut a small piece and put on the hinge near the boom then a smaller piece ( if needed ) on top of the other . This will make a space between your cheek and the boom so people can hear you ! You will still be able to close the boom .	1
I recently dropped my land line and went 100 % wireless for telephone service ; with this change , I wanted to make sure I did n't suffer from numb arm talking on the smaller cell phone for longer periods and wanted to use a hands-free approach . My previous experiences with that were not very satisfying back in the day of earbuds and dangling wires . But , with a new cellphone came Bluetooth wireless capability , which opened up a new world of options.I had played with a number in the store , but did n't get any real world experience with them . But , I really liked the design and feel of the H700 . I did some research - much of it through reviews here on Amazon ; this left me a bit skeptical as there were many unfavorable reviews written here - they mentioned negatives like poor sound quality , minimum range , and Bluetooth connective problems to name a few . But , I decided to side with some other review I had read and the positive reviews on Amazon.The bottom line is I am very happy with my H700 . I have experienced absolutely no problems - the people I have talked to all can hear me fine , and I can hear them ; I have had the H700 up to 7 feet from my phone with no reception problems ; and the H700 was easy to setup with my phone ( LG VX8300 ) and immediately connects whenever I turn the device on.Feature-wise , the H700 is great ! The buttons are easy to use and understand and the flip mic is great idea ... the phone rings , just flip it open ( keep it closed to conserve power ) and the call is answered immediately ; flip it closed to end the call and it powers down as well . The H700 also features a button for answering and ending calls if you do n't want to power down the unit.I highly recommend the Motorola H700 as your Bluetooth headset choose - I have yet to find a negative about it .	1
I like this headset . It is very comfortable and lightweight . Stays on fine when adjusted properly . The volume is great . Callers say they can hear me fine without noise interference . What I like best is You can close it to turn it off an open it and it automatically reconnects . You can answer call waiting with this too . Also I have n't had it randomly disconnect as I turn my head as my other one did . I do n't know about battery life yet as i only have had it 3 days .	1

I purchased this headset to replace a Jabra headset suddenly that died . After using this for a month I find that it works great and is as clear as the headset I replaced . I have not had the problems that others report with the sound but I have a Razr V3 so maybe it is more compatable with this phone.I have had not had any complaints from anyone I have spoken with about not being able to hear me and I and tried it by having a friend use the headset while I called them to have a conversation and I could hear just as clearly using a regular phone.It is also comfortable to wear and the buttons are easy to feel when wearing the headset and easy to push which makes it easier to use when driving . I have medium sized ears with detached lobes and I am a girl so I have not had any issues with fit or feeling uncomfortable because it looks like an earring . A friend saw me wearing it and thought that I had purchased some cute earrings , she complemented me on my taste then realized it was my headset . Personally I think it looks better than the bulky Lt. Uhura style headsets.I have a motorola V3 and my car and wall chargers fit this headset so I can charge it anywhere.Great value for the money .	1
I tried a few BT headsets and it came down to the Nokia BH-800 and the Jabra JX10 . Both units have good audio quality . I also liked that both units are small . Thus , you do n't look like you are on your way to a Star Trek convention while you are wearing them.While I liked the JX10 's design over the BH-800 , it had trouble understanding my voice commands . I use Microsoft Voice Command with my XV6700 PocketPC phone . I had to speak to the JX10 very slow and clearly to achieve only a 50 % success rate in it understanding my commands the first try and subsequent tries . The BH-800 understands my commands closer to 90 % on the first try and 99 % on the second try.The JX10 was comfortable in my ear without the earloop . It never came close to falling out- it passed the head tilt test and the bend over test . With the earloop , however , I could barely hear the unit . The earloop prevents the unit from coming close enough to the ear.Pros:1 . Good audio quality . People can clearly hear me and I can clearly hear them.2 . It 's small . It 's less `` geeky '' than some headsets.3 . Nice look and button layout.4 . Charge cradle and USB charging is a nice bonus.Cons:1 . I had to remove the ear loop so that I could get the unit close enough to my ear to hear it.2 . I felt like I might break the unit when connecting and disconnecting it from the cradle.3 . Did not work well with Microsoft Voice Command . This was the show stopper and why I picked the Nokia BH-800 instead .	1
I 've had a few bluetooth headsets over the past few years , and this is easily the best one I 've used so far.The main talking points have already been covered to death , so I 'm just going to give you a couple of reasons why I love it.First and foremost , it pairs to two devices . Most headsets will only pair to one device , so if you want to switch between devices , you have to re-pair it every time . In my case , I have the headset paired to both my Motorola Q and my Playstation 3 . Whichever device I am using at the time , the headset will automatically connect to that device.The sound quality is excellent , and the range is far greater than any other headset I 've used.So there it is . It may not be a ten page review with all the Jabra specs pasted in , but that 's how I feel about the thing . : - ) In the oft-repeated words of mothers everywhere , `` Try it . You 'll like it . ''	1
I 'm very happy with my Jabra JX10 headset . My treo 650 is very finicky but it works pretty well with the Jabra . The Jabra JX10 is amazingly small and most people ca n't even tell I 'm on a wireless headset ( which is really amazing because everybody knows when my wife is on her Plantronics 640 ) .Also , I have a car with a convertible top and I can still hear people fine when using this headset- it 's quite loud.P.S . I upgraded to a Treo 755p in the summer of 2007 and it continued to work great - range and sound quality were even better with the Treo 755p .	1
I just spent the last month trialing 6 different bluetooth headsets . I 'm a frequnt business travler & heavy user . My phone is a Treo 700w.On with the review ... .Pros : * Pairing it took only seconds , very easy process . * It work better than , with my phone , the other 5 headsets . Meaning when I hit the send button it was on ... ..when the phone received an incoming call it was on . Extremely responsive . * Very comfortable , I wore the headset for several hours for 3 days without any complaints . * Excellent incoming sound both volume & quality . The sound quality was as good as the phone internal speaker . * Battery - I never ran it down but charged it each day . I typically talk 3 to 4 hours per day . * Minimal `` static '' I could wear the headset in my holster without any issues . * It would work up to the 10 meter mark but the static would pick up significantly.Con 's : * The outgoing sound was n't much better then most . I was told that I sounded like I 'm talking ... .. '' in a tunnel '' & `` on a headset '' So as you can tell the positives outweigh the negatives . It 's a good headset but not for business use .	1
I use to be the flagbearer for the Cardo Scala 500 and LogiTech Pro -- - and while those headsets hold a special place in my heart , they 'll never see the light of day anymore because of this great new headset from JabraThe JX10 is an EXCELLENT headset -- - I 'll list the pros and cons below -1 . SOUND QUALITY OUTBOUND -- - I called my own voicemail and talked into it , while wearing this headset -- - not only did it sound great in my regular voice , but I could even hear myself whispering ( yes , I tested that too ) -- - so do n't believe those who say that people on the other end will not hear you -- - outbound sound quality wise , its the best headset out there , as I heard no static , no drop-outs , and no tunnel effects2 . SIZE -- - easily , this is the most comfy headset out there -- - it is optional to attach it to your ear , and wear it without the loop -- - honestly , the loop holds it in place much better , with no discomfort one bit -- - yes , you can wear it without the loop , and it will hold okay , but either way is fine -- - the thing is TINY which is neat3 . CALL PICK UP -- - call pick up happens instaneous , with a half a second delay -- - no manual initiation necessary4 . BATTERY and CHARGER -- - the battery seems to hold just fine all day -- - and the charger is real small -- - the package also includes a USB charger , so that you can charge it over USB on your computer , which I thought was pretty useful for people on the roadOther pros would be that the RANGE seems pretty solid , and PAIRING was easy ( I liked that JABRA created a SEPERATE pairing button ) I would consider VOLUME a pro -- - it would be nice if it was louder -- - however , I can hear everyone just fine , provided that I 'm indoors ( whether that be in the office , in the car , etc ) -- - it can hold its own outdoors , but if you use your headset a lot outside , then you may wan na test run the JX10 first -- - I think the Cardo Scala 500 had the LOUDEST volume , and the JX10 comes very close to that loudnessCONS -- -1 . BUTTONS -- - this is really a MINOR complaint -- - I think the button placement ( accepting calls , ending calls ) could be a little better - but its not a big deal , and certainly , not a deal breaker -- - the thing is so small , that its kinda hard to fit any buttons on it anywayshonestly -- - ca n't think of any other consThe headset is definitely the best looking -- - silver with black streaks ! I love this headset , and its gon na be awhile until its unseatedyes , the price is steep , but its worth it -- - take my word for itthank you for reading and HAPPY BUYING ! ! ! ! !	1
Works great for my home office . I use this A LOT . No defects or issues so far . I 've had for about a month.Will buy again if it breaks . Highly recommend .	1
I use mine every day . Good quality connection and reliable . Battery life is also very good .	1
I was tasked by my office manager to purchase some headsets to make our office calls easier . I looked at corded headsets , cordless , and a variety of brands , but this unit kept coming up with high praises.The clarity is great , and it has a variety of volume ( macro and micro ) for both the mic and earpiece . It works seamlessly with any phone system and has a multitude of connection options . The range allows us to go to the end of our warehouse to look at stock while talking with the customer . Not to mention that if I 'm not at my desk and the phone rings , I do n't have to rush back . I can use both my hands to look up quotes , and stock while I 'm on the phone without craning my neck . Their are earpieces and over the head options . Not to mention the battery life lasts all day as long as you plug it in at night.Great product !	1
I have this headset for work and use the band that wraps around the head instead of just the ear loop . I find this is the most comfortable option for me . The headset has been great and I have never had a problem with it since i have owned it ( approx 2 years ) . The range is great and I can get up from my desk and walk to the printer during a call no problem . Overall I am very pleased with this headset and others in my office have purchased this based on my recommendation and they love it as well .	1
While waiting for my order to arrive , I read a negative review about a terrible echo . My advice to that reviewer - consider reading the instructions and adjust the mouth piece away from your mouth ( not in the instructions ) . Initially the headset hanging on one ear was a little uncomfortable , but within days I was walking out of the office forgetting I was even wearing it . The range at the building I work is less than 100 feet , not a problem for my use . Ca n't imagine not having the headset lifter or the flashing light accessory that clearly tells others when I am on the phone !	1
Cliffnotes summation- AWESOME well thought out easy to install product ... ... . ! ! ! Details-Purchased the CS55/HL10 after an Amazon price match locally . Been using the standard Plantronics corded headset for years on my old ATT 4 line business phone . I finally got tired of the corded limitations and researched this unit online.Basically the system installs nicely and the `` handset lifter '' is included ( $ 39 value ) at the Amazon price . My older phone supports a headset but is not configured for the newer headset connection option which this Plantronics unit also supports . The lifter is simple to install and powered from the Plantronics headset recharger base . Handset and speakerphone capabilities are not affected by installation of the lifter device under the handset . You can use your phone handset if your earpiece is still charging or be really lazy and just use the speakerphone if your situation allows that.With the lifter installed you simply put the headset on your ear , push a button on the earpiece and the lifter raises the phone hand set about 1/2 inch out of the cradle and your line becomes active . Then dial your number or hit the your speed dialer on whatever phone you are hooking the system to . What really clinches the deal on this system is that you can use your older desk telephone without having to spend additional funds on a landline phone set.Wireless frequencies-The new wireless frequency standard is extremely clear and static free with my office Netgear N900 and DLink N-Wireless routers up and running without any equipment or frequency conflicts that plague the older systems that may have caused major problems in the past . During my test calls and walking around testing in the house the voice quality and signal was crystal clear at all times.Good installation instruction manual and online help if you need it make this a real snap to install . Let the headset charge in the base for 3 hours and you will be up and running for 10 hours of talk time if you need it ... ... ... ... ..Plantronics CS55/HL10 Wireless Headset BundlePlantronics is not the cheapest but it is one of the best and it JUST WORKS ! ! ! ! !	1
Update : After several motnhs of use , this unit is working great . Range is easily 50 ft+ I like to pace while I talk on tough calls , and this unit is flawless for that ! ; ) -- -The Plantronics CS55 is a nice desk-based bluetooth unit . I use it on an Inter-Tel phone system at work . The body of the unit connects to your telephone line , an AC adapter , and a unit that sits on your phone to lift up the receiver during calls . So there are a lot of wires , but you can tuck it away at the edge of your desk . The ear piece , which charges on the main unit body , is pretty hefty and I generally have a hard time getting to hang on my ear securely . But it is flexible and after a few moments of adjustment , it stays pretty well but still wobbles around a bit . Earpiece quality is very good . For speaking into the unit , you will need to recrd yourself at different mouthpiece placements ( e.g. , talk call in to your own voice mail ) . The mic picks up lots of noise ( rustling of clothes , breathing , drinking , etc . ) , so it is good t be aware of how these are being heard by doing some testing . Good voice quality , but watch those extra noises that yo might not be used to thinking about on a normal phone handset . Good unit , works fine .	1
My old Plantronics headset needed to be replaced and I went with this one . It is much more sturdy , with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit . My old one would 'float ' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was , which meant I could n't use it the next day until it charged for a while . Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders . Sound quality is excellent . I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit . I can easily get files from across the room or do other things while talking without missing a beat .	1
I am extremely happy with both the sound quality and the range from base on this set . The freedom of not being wired to the phone & headset base it great . My only complaint is that the `` over the ear '' pieces are very hard & uncomfortable -- there are several sizes but after a couple of hours , all earpieces are terribly uncomfortable ( and I am someone that has worn over the ear headsets for 10+ years ) . I finally switched to the `` over the head '' attachment , which has a nice , padded earpiece and it solved the problem . I usually do n't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & does n't mess up my hair . I would have given this 5 stars if they had figured out how to make a comfortable earpiece .	1
I have tried 3 or 4 different bluetooth headsets for my office phone but finally decided to stay with the Plantronics one because it is the most comfortable one and the sound quality is definitely the best . The handset lifter works great so you wo n't have to push buttons and lift handsets and ... .It just makes things a lot easier . Great product !	1
not a lot of these batteries around my area , the 1 i did locate was n't nearly as cheap , this works great . not sure what else to say about a good battery .	1
the product was what I was looking for , a little delay on delivery but no complain , a lot more cheaper than getting it at any retail , so the wait is so worth the wait . can not complain , but I will recommend it	1
I charged this battery and used it on my sell phone one time and it is very good battery , but know I am keeping it as a spare , till the other one stops working .	1
This battery is great ! It was shipped immediately and even arrived with almost a full charge . I did finish charging it before use and it has lasted almost a week , although I do n't use my phone a lot . It looks and works exactly like the original and is well worth the price .	1
The ability to leave my MP3 music ( cell phone ) in my gym bag and get a serious workout without disruption is worth the price along . Being on call , it 's also important that I do n't miss any of those important phone calls . Getting interrupted with a voice announcement of who 's calling makes it all worthwhile . After the first use I was hooked . All of my weekday workouts are with my bluetooth stereo headset . As for the weekends , I 'm back to the Zune , not because I dislike the headphones , because I need to escape from the phone .	1
I 've been having it for weeks . It works fine when both listening to music and talking via Skype . The mic pick up my voice quite well even with that small hole away from mouth . Once fully charged , it lasts a long time when using it for stereo music streaming.Pros : Sound quality is great , as being a bluetooth headphone . Battery lasts long enough . The microphone does pick up sound perfectly.Cons : Feel a little pinched above ears after wearing it for a while . It would be great if the belt is expandable .	1
I bought this one 2 years ago , it still work well , battery life is good and I recharge it once a week , it can be charged on car too.Volume can be adjusted easily , I like chat with driving and it is a wonderful earphone.With a cable you can connect to your pc directly and listen to music too.In winter it is so wonderful , as it is a ear protection in a cold and windy morning : - ) it is a little bit heavier at beginning , for man it is perfect , my daughters can not wear it without holding it.in one word , it is a good product .	1
i got one of this first , and tested on Samsung Upstage cellphone , it was great , so I ordered another one for my Samsung Blackjack and the ATT Tilt , it does what it claims to do , loving every minute of it . I even took to Myrtle Beach listening to music while on the beach.the downside , it 'wears ' your ear , and after an hour of using it , your ears gets a bit uneasy with it ...	1
Great sound , quick sync . The headphones are a bit heavy to run with , but for relaxing around the house they are great . I was suprised that I could talk on them too .	1
I purchased the headphone from local storepairing is easy , press big M button on left side till the blue light bacomes solidthen run search , pick motorola HT820 , enter passcode 00002 options appear on my MDA ( 2.26 official ROM ) hands freewireless stereothe sound is pretty good , but the problem is : it 's not good under crowded enviornment ( a lot of hollow noise ) seldom skips with MDA	1
The HT820 by motorola delivers wired quality sound ( when in A2DP mode ) in a wireless format . It also has a microphone so you can make calls on your phone or use it as a microphone for your computer ( with a bluetooth dongle ) .Pros : -Very good quality sound . They are better than my computer speakers . It 's about 180 Kilobytes a second on bluetooth.-Soft Ear pads . They are very comforatable and make them alot nicer to use.-Battery life . I have n't owned another AD2P headset , but these things can go over 10 hours on decent volume without stopping.-Came with a carrying bag . It was fuzzy and could hold the pass through cable ( Which allows it to be wired as well ) , the charger as well as the headset.Cons : -I 'll be straight ; This thing is freaking huge . Each earpiece about half the size of a 20 year old male 's fist . And the headset ca n't bend well.-When you wear these for over an hour your head will begin to scream at you in pain because it 's like pinching your skull . It goes away after about a month or two ( Do n't put it in the bag or it 'll bend them back to normal ) .-You ca n't charge and use it at the sametime , which is a bummer.Comments : The glowy light is a pain and I did alot to try and turn it off because the manual does n't say a thing about it , and then I somehow turned it off . Later I found out that you press both & lt ; | & | > buttons on the right ear piece and it turns the lights on or off.Compared to other headsets in the current bluetooth headset market , I 'd probably go with these .	1
I 'm using this product past 5 months and its b'ful and awesome sound quality . I did n't found any issue with this product . Easy to configure and connect . It works with my Sony Erricson W580i Walkman phone as well as my laptop . Sound quality and beats are very good . Distortion only if u move your head 90 % on left , but ignorable . Its not bulky and fit easily . Its in build mic is good . While playing a music if call comes u can atend it with this headset . It has its own volume adjustment . Overall , a good peace which makes me fully satisfied . I got what i was looking for . no wire hassle now .	1
I have owned this item for at least five years , I do n't believe that I 've never reviewed it . This was one of the first bluetooth headphones to come out and I still believe it is one of the best . I have only a couple of things that I would consider to be cons . 1 . The headphones are really heavy on your ears . It becomes painful after a while . 2 . The buttons are really sensitive . I have accidentally called and hung up on so many people that it 's ridiculous . On the other hand , I love the ability to listen to my MP3 player and use my phone with the same headset . I have been told by many people that the sound is incredible compared to their bluetooth headphones . The bass is wonderful and people can hear me clearly when I make a call . It picks up background noise which is not good , however . I tried other headphones and I keep coming back to these . They are , by far , the best pair that I have owned .	1
I bought these to pair with my Samsung P2 music/video player . The pairing was easy and all of the features work well with the P2 except I can not change the equalizer settings on the P2 when paired and P2 does not support FM radio with Bluetooth.The sound quality is very good ( not too much bass ) and great for a wireless headset but not in the league of the Shure earbuds that I have or the Bose Quiet Comfort 1 ( both which cost significantly more than the Jabra ) . Listening to music or watching videos in places where wires are problematical -- - as well as those who exercise with a music player -- - these an easy buy , espcically at the price of $ 38+ dollars.I do n't use these with my cell phone as I use a Jawbone for my cell . For some reason the Jabra paired with my computer but I am not sure why I can not get sound . Dell 's Bluetooth module has always been problematical , so I will assume it is the computer and not the Jabra .	1
After reading some of the other reviews that were not so favorable , I was pleasantly surprised with this headset after taking advantage of a really good deal recently . The sound quality is excellent with really impressive bass response . Now I am pairing this with an LG VX8700 and perhaps that makes some difference . There are some minor issues though . Placing the phones properly on your head can mean that they are comfortable for a time , but eventually after about 2 hours they do seem to pinch . But even then it is not unbearable . I have cycled with them , music stops when you answer and then resumes . I have jogged with them , ear pieces pop off so you can rinse if necessary . Occasionally either the phone or the headset gets confused if you are trying to do something too fast . Flipping through songs , and you have to re-pair the device . Sound quality is pretty good through the microphone considering the distance . Very slightly muffled , but still clear enough to not be a limiting factor . A cool feature is that tap the right ear piece and it opens the music player on the phone and starts playing . Jabra should consider putting a locking button at an appropriate location because it is easy to inadvertently push one of the many buttons when you are taking off or adjusting the phones . Eventually you do learn how to handle to avoid this , but it is quirky . I would so recommend this headset for those looking for something to pair with one of the newer phones that support a2d over bluetooth . Excellent for cycling ! Update 8/22/07 This headset continues to operate great , despite being dropped numerous times . As a side note , I found as I was riding today that the pairing between my lg vx 8700 was fouled as the music was intermittent . While there is the occasional stumble in the otherwise smooth streaming , this was different . I ended up removing the device from my 8700 and re-pairing it . Fixed . The only thing I can think of is that I had recently unplugged my phone while it was docked in usb mode to my pc and you are not supposed to do that without ending via the menu first.I use this headset to run with too and found a little floss can go along way . Yep , I tied a bit of floss between the ear pieces leaving one side with a simple knot . Then with the floss in position across the top of my head I pulled the ear pieces down until the plastic pieces which normally end up pinching the tops of the ears were just above the tops . I then double knotted the simple knot again and voila , the floss helps support the headset while you are running and the pinching that I noted in my original review is reduced greatly . I am actually sitting typing this listening to some Petty . Great stuff ...	1
The battery life on these is phenomenal . I 've been using these headphones with theJabra Bluetooth Music Adapterand the headphones outlast the adapter every time , and we 're talking about 8+ hours of constant use.I 'm also using this headset along with my PC and my RazrV3m . The phone does not support Stereo Bluetooth Audio ( A2DP ) but it does support the regular headset profile that most , if not all Bluetooth enabled phones have . This means that the headphones work as a regular wireless headset for any Bluetooth enabled phone or Skype on your PC / Mac.On the PC , the headphones provide the mic input , the mono headset feature and the stereo headset feature . This means that I can be watching a video or listening to music in beautiful stereo sound and if a call comes though on Skype , it 'll switch over to the microphone & mono headset profile for the VOIP conversation . The same is true for using the music adapter mentioned above and a mobile phone . When a call comes in , the music pauses / mutes ( depending on the device ) and you can answer the call by tapping the left ear piece . Tapping the right ear piece will pause / mute the music at any time.Sound quality is actually very impressive . If you 're using these with your PC and the sound is coming through mudddy and crackly , it means that you 're not using the Stereo ( higher audio quality as well ) profile . It 's quite possible to listen to music using the Mono ( used for mobile phone conversations ) profile , but you 're missing the great sound if you do.A great thing about the sound quality is that the range is quite wide . I hear certain things in music with these headphones that my iPod and Zune headphones just wont reproduce . The headphones are not earbuds ( or earplugs as I call them ) so you can actually still hear someone if they speak to you , that is you wo n't be completely oblivious.They came with a wall charger as well as a USB cable so that 's very nice . The manual says not to use any other cables to charge the headphones , but close observation will reveal that it 's just an ordinary USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable . ( Probably what your digital camera uses . )	1
Jabra did nothing wrong with these . They are solidly build and beautifully designed . They have paired easily with every device I 've tried , and even work very well as a hands free headset for a bluetooth cell phone . However , they do n't work with my Mac , and contrary to the insinuation by the other reviewer , this is in no way Jabra 's fault . Bluetooth is bluetooth , and it 's up to the computer manufacturer to support the `` profiles '' supported by various devices . In the case of the Mac , Apple 's Bluetooth support is incomplete ; they do n't handle the advanced audio profile required for stereo headsets , and so this headset ( or ANY other stereo bluetooth headset , for that matter ) will not work with a Mac until Apple decides to fix this . This is completely out of Jabra 's control , and this is a very well engineered device . If you own a Window 's XP computer , this will work very well.The only negative I can find is that the headset is not adjustable and thus may not fit everybody comfortably . ( My wife , for example , ca n't get these to sit well . )	1
I purchased these with minimal expectations and am quite impressed . I have been using these with my cell phone and the sound quality is superb . Also , using these for phone calls is quite convenient . The microphone is great and sound quality is top-notch . Even when music is playing and you get a call it automatically pauses the music for the phone call and then resumes it when the call is finished . Battery life is way longer than I had expected ; I have owned these for a couple of months now and have only had to charge them twice . Buttons on the headset are quite convenient as well . I would say the only downside to these is that they are a tad bulky somewhat resembling earmuffs . Also , depending on your head size these may or may not fit on you ; I can fortunately say that they fit me with no discomfort and stay on my head even when at the gym . Great product !	1
You can read the other reviews about how awesome this phone is . But , if you want a bluetooth headset to go along with it , get the Plantronics Voyager 510 . I 've tried the Motorola HS850 and H500 & a Logitech BT headset and all of them had significant static . I 've searched google and found other people have the same problem with this phone and multiple other types of headsets . Go with the Plantronics Voyager 510 . It has very very little static and I can leave the phone in one room and walk to another with only a slight ( almost negligable ) increase in static . The only problem is that the `` answer '' button on headset will answer the phone but I wo n't automatically connect to the headset . I must first answer the phone by pushing the green button on the phone and then press the `` answer '' button on the headset . . .afterwards , connection is seamless . A minor inconvenience for the luxury of wireless BT that is virtually static-free . Do n't take my word for it . Buy a Voyager 510 from a local store where you can easily return it if you 're not happy.MP3 RINGTONES ! ! ! ! this phone is great for making MP3 ringtones . HOWEVER , you most change the file extension from `` .mp3 '' to `` .3gp '' . Transfering `` .3gp '' files to your phone is a sinch with the free USB cable and PC software . And , if you want to edit your mp3 so that you play only the chorus of the song as the ringtone , Samsung gives you software for that too ! ! ! ! It 's all included in the PC Studio Software that comes with the phone . DO N'T FORGET TO CHANGE THE EXTENSION TO `` .3GP '' . The phone will allow you to play any mp3 songs ( like an IPOD ) but it wo n't allow you to make MP3 songs as ringtones unless you pay for it by downloading from some website like T-mobile . . . OR , by the method mentioned above . Changing the extension to 3gp is also easy if you have a program that will show you the FULL NAME of a music file ( i.e . check_up_on_it.mp3 ) , like Nero Burning ROM .	1
This is the greatest GSM phone on US market by far ... .way better than V3 and others.Someone said it 's slimsy , but I 've proven this is no right on the second day of my ownership : ) . I have dropped it from my 2-ft high desk to the concrete floor once today and it got nothing damaged , not even a dent or mark.But there are couple of bad designs as well ( or maybe I 'm just too picky : - ) .1 . No voice dialing function , which is the most needed function when make calls while driving ; 2 . The camera is only 1.3 Megapixle resolution , so it 's fine when viewing your photo just on the phone screen , but when you put it onto your computer , it turns into unacceptable ; 3 . It does record videos , but only for couple of seconds , which means this function basically is useless in daily life ; 4 . The most bad design is the earphone . It 's so loose in my ears so when I turn my head a little bit , it will fall off . I had to pick it up when it fell or use a finger to hold it while I was driving and calling , and you know you have to keep on turning your head around when driving ! 5 . You ca n't pick up phone calls by just pressing on the button on the earphone wire.In all , I still recommend this one	1
Motorola was floundering in the cell phone market until they came out with the RAZR . Worldwide , it made a fashion and technological statement , which catapulted the manufacturer from a dismal afterthought to a leader in the cell phone market . Then they released a candy bar equivalent ( SLVR ) , and then improved on the RAZR 's lines with the stylish clamshell PEBL . This review is for the Motorola PEBL.After using the PEBL for a few days , the first thing that impressed me was the sound quality . Recently , I have played with Sony/Ericson , PalmOne , Nokia and Samsung phones , and must say the Motorola sounds best . First of all , the volume in the earpiece is loud enough for me to hear while walking on a busy New York city street , with cars , trucks and buses all creating a deafening noise . Second , the volume control button is well placed to allow you to easily adjust the level . Third , and best of all , the phone is intelligent enough to filter out much of the loud background noise , so that the person you 're speaking with can hear you without struggling to make out what you 're saying . I have found that Nokia is good at this too , while Palm , Samsung and Sony/Ericson phones do n't do this well at all , with Sony ironically at the back of the pack . Also noteworthy is the speakerphone . While it 's not as loud as an office phone 's speaker , it is plenty loud , for example , to participate in a conference call while driving . And with the background noise reduction virtues of this phone , I was impressed . Also , it has voice recognition - based solely on the spelling of your contacts , the phone will recognize what you 're saying and be able to voice-dial.It may seem odd to make such a fuss over sound quality in an age of smart phones , but as a designer recently explained to me : form should follow function . So let the PEBL first and foremost be a good phone . Then you can add the bells and whistles later . Attention to this principle is what earned the PEBL five stars from me.A note about carriers : GSM is worldwide , so you can use your phone overseas as well as in the USA . However , this limits you in the states to Tmobile and Cingular . Having used both , I feel that Tmobile sounds better , but Cingular has better coverage . It 's a tradeoff . Both carriers offer a 7 or 14 day `` trial '' period during which you can test the network 's performance . I recommend use that trial , and do n't hesitate to bounce back and forth while keeping your number.I have four major pros for the PEBL:1 . Motorola is pioneering the cell phone market by making all of their latest models `` quad-band '' GSM , which means the phone will work well in the USA ( 850/1900 Mhz ) as well as the rest of the world ( 900/1800 Mhz ) . Most GSM phones are Tri-Band ( 850/1800/1900 ) so while they 'll work great here , but performance abroad will be touch and go , with the phone performing poorly indoors . None of the others ( Nokia , Ericson , Samsung etc . ) offer quad-band GSM as a standard , and until Motorola 's recent offerings , you could only find Quad-Band phones in massive PDA smart phones.2 . Battery life : All cell phones give estimates in standby time and talk time . But the realistic factor is how long will this thing last between charges for the average person ? My answer : 3 to 4 days . With moderate use ( about 10 calls a day , totaling between 30 and 45 minutes ) , I needed to charge the phone after the 3rd day.3 . USB port : the phone 's connection to the world is via a standard mini-USB port . The charger fits this , or you can plug it into your computer with a standard USB to mini-USB cable . This is the same cable that connects most digital cameras or certain mp3 players ( at least the ones that do n't use overpriced proprietary cables ) . Chances are you already have one of these cables and if you plug it into your PC , two things will happen : the phone will start to charge from the USB , and the PC will detect a new device . Download the drivers from Motorola ( if you did n't get the CD with your phone ) . In addition to phone drivers , there is a `` Phone Tools '' application that lets you to synchronize your contact list and calendar with Outlook , or you can simply backup the phone 's contents . You can synchronize your photos , ringtones and SMS messages as well . Here 's the best part : the phone is also a modem . Make sure you have a data plan before connecting to the internet , and you no longer need a hot spot . GPRS will give you a little more than 2x the speed of dialup , EDGE will take it up to about 4x.4 . The phone has an alarm built in . In fact it has several , and you can name them , and if you turn the phone off at night , the alarm will still work , and ask you if you want to turn the phone on when you silence it.Other noteworthy items : the screen is good , the camera produces reasonable images and videos , and there is enough memory to snap over 100 shots at the phone 's highest resolution . That is a nice touch.And now , three Cons:1 . For the longest time , I have not cared much for the Motorola contact management interface . Nearly all phones now allow you to have multiple numbers / addresses per contact , but Motorola has n't caught on yet . If you have a contact with multiple phone numbers , that contact will exist multiple times . This makes dialing slower with Motorola phones because you 'll have to scroll through a longer contact list ; searching for numbers is not nearly as intuitive as with Nokia or other phone brands.2 . The phone allows you to assign custom ring tones for certain members of the address book ; however , for contacts with a custom ringtone , the phone does n't differentiate between calls and text messages , so if a contact with a custom tone sends a text , the phone might play an entire minute-long song rather than a quick beep beep , which can be annoying in the middle of the night . Just avoid using custom contact/ring tone assignments and you 'll avoid that problem.3 . The shiny dialing surface and screen will pick up grease from your face and require regular cleaning if you want to avoid your phone looking `` icky '' .In conclusion , I was happily surprised with the PEBL . It is a very sexy phone , and it sounds great . It is the perfect phone for the audiophile , or for a person who wants a device that just works without having to cope with all the secondary bells and whistles phones have these days . Historically , Motorola was known for producing good hardware - a virtue that is clearly stated with the PEBL . If you intend to use all the fancy features of modern cell phones ( SMS , MMS , etc ) - in other words if you plan to use the software features , expect them to be less intuitive than with other brands of phones . As much as Motorola is known for producing excellent hardware , their menus and navigation can be bewildering at times . I think they should get the folks who designed the hardware to redesign the software interface . Then , the Moto range would dominate . In the end , it 's a good phone , it 's solid , it 's small and light enough to fit in comfortablty your pocket , and above all it works .	1
I have had this phone for two months now and it is the best one I have owned , I have had three razr 's and many other so called cutting edge phones even the V3i and none are as good as this , as for the pebl it is simple to open unless you are a butter fingered fool , and as for the finish wearing off on the keypad well mine is just fine.The phone is made better than the flimsey Razr is , you want a quality phone that works as well as it looks get this phone , you want cheap made buy something else .	1
I purchased this phone to use in Europe during a recent trip . I loved it . Very nice form factor , opening it requires only one hand and voice quality was great . Very happy with the purchase . I wish my US carrier ( Verizon ) had the same phone !	1
Hmmm ? What can I say about the phone that everyone seems to want ? The Motorola PEBL phone itself , is indubitably eye-catching . It offers exceptional operation & premium features.The PEBL is one of the most charming phones . Shaped like a river stone , it 's attired in basic black & is nicely accessorized by a shiny metal hinge . I especially liked the oval shape , the rounded edges , and the rubbery textured feel of the casing is pretty nifty . It 's very compact ( 3.4 '' x 1.9 '' x 0.8 '' ; 3.8 ounces ) , and it has weight when it 's in your hand.As for features ... The phone book holds 1,000 contacts , each of which can take six phone numbers , an e-mail address , a postal address , and a birth date . I like that you can place photos with contacts for caller ID that are viewed on the internal screen . Contacts can be assigned one of 12 polyphonic or MP3 's . I also appreciate the camera , vibrate mode , a one-minute voice recorder , voice dialing , calculator , calendar , alarm clock , text & multimedia messaging , PC syncing ( my favorite ! ! ) , instant messaging ( with Yahoo , AOL , and/or ICQ ) , and a Web browser . You can personalize the PEBL with a variety of wallpapers , themes , menu styles , color skins , screensavers , and message tones . You can always download more depending on your service provider.Ok , now the bad . The PEBL has a low-resolution camera ( whaaa ) , and a strange magnetic flip that is awkward to open with your thumb . The flip opens when dropped and can demagnetize credit cards.Would I buy the PEBL again ? Yes . Would I recommend it to others ? Sure . Who could n't say 'yes ' to such a looker ? ! ! ? !	1
After my dreadful V551 , I was hesitant to return to Motorola . Since my Sony Ericsson S710a did n't work out , and since my wife 's V3 has been solid so far , I decided to give Moto one more chance with the V3i.First , the build quality and materials are EXCELLENT . The machined aluminum outer casing , and machined nickel keypad , provide substantial heft ( this is good ) and tactility . Moto could 've used a little better plastic in places , but it 's fine otherwise.Second , although its resolution is lower than the S710a 's , the V3i inner display 's physical screen size is about the same . Meaning it 's plenty large , not to mention clear , colorful , and bright . The outer display is nothing special , but it is a compromise for better battery life , so I can live with that.Third , unlike Sony Ericsson , the new Moto 's ( V3i , SLVR L7 , etc . ) sport an industry-standard mini-USB charging/data port , and use standard memory cards . ( I put a 1GB TransFlash in mine and it is amazing . ) No more proprietary chargers and cables , nor goofy Sony-only `` Memory Sticks . `` Fourth , the Bluetooth . Motorola has come a long way to improve their implementation , and though it is not as full featured as Sony Ericsson 's , it is almost unshakable in its stability . ( Sony Ericsson has the reverse trend . The T616 had great Bluetooth , the S710a 's was unstable . The new W600 and W900 are equally unstable . ) Range is excellent , too.Fifth , reception and call quality are both excellent . Volume could be better , but is still adequate . I have to admit , though , that the S710a was slightly better with earpiece and speakerphone audio volume and quality.Finally , the much maligned UI . Yes , Sony Ericsson trumps everyone with their interface and Address Book ; Motorola executes both of these rather clumsily , thus requiring a steep learning curve . However , two areas where Moto outshines Sony Ericsson are 1 ) consistent UI responsiveness and 2 ) broad customizability.My only other gripe is the 50 song limit in iTunes , even with the memory card upgrade . However , I 'm an iPod owner , so this does n't concern me too much.Now for a word of warning to Mac users . My iTunes-equipped V3i , unlocked and unbranded , came from an overseas market ( phone and manual languages included UK English , Vietnamese , Bhasat , and Thai ) . It has full Bluetooth functionality with my Mac , including iSync . However , some V3i 's do n't work over Bluetooth - the Mac ca n't `` see '' any of the phone 's services , thus preventing file transfers or iSync-ability without a USB connection . I ca n't say for sure if this is related to iTunes or not , but so far it seems the iTunes-loaded V3i 's work better . Caveat emptor !	1
Very good value for the money . Phone is very nice looking , a little elegant and conservative I would say.The metal top gives it a little better look and feeling compared to the previous plain razor V3 . I use it heavily for work and even so the battery charge is good for 2 or 3 days . Speakers sound nice for mp3 playing , the camera takes clear pictures and it is full of other little extras , however if you are a fan of advanced features and apps , then think twice.For me and for work this phone is perfect.The only thing that i do n't like much is that the volume is not so loud , and if you are talking in a noisy place you may want it a little higher , and also be advised that this offer does not include the little memory card so you have to buy it separately.Delivery was very fast and so far I can say I am happy with this phone.If you want a day to day good looking phone I recommend you to get it .	1
This is the best phone I ever owned . Reception is very good , battery life is good , ring is audible , and quality of voice is very good . Mine already came with ear phone , USB cable , leather case and 256MB memory card . There are a few things that are not so good : - Need to clean cover frequently ( it gets easily smudged ) ; - MP3 sound is not perfect ( well this is a phone not a MP3 player ) ; - Once when I switched the GSM card it reverted to Kanji characters and I had a hard time to find the English option ; )	1
I really enjoy the high quality , that 's a constant with Belkin . With this product that reputation not only repeats , but holds up .	1
I received this item on time and in good condition . I have other retractable cables like this and this is one of the better ones I have used . Perfect for storing in a vehicle for charging . No mess in the glove compartment .	1
works as advertised and all that cord , normally in the way , does not get tangled . Genius solution . Why did n't someone do this earlier ?	1
And , a great price too . The product works exactly as the factory cord ; and , the retractable feature allows me to easily keep this one stored in my truck instead of toting all of my cords back and forth from the house to the truck .	1
Given the other reviews here , decided that getting two batteries would be smart due to the freshness issue , in case the first one did n't last as long . ( My original battery was worn out . ) It 's been a couple months now and the first battery is still going strong where before I needed to have the charger with me to finish my calls . Price was a major factor here compared to retail and I wanted to wait a few months before considering a new phone . The much lower price made this plan easier , giving me plenty of time to consider the next generation of Razr . And if these batteries quickly died in the short-term then I did n't lose that much in the deal .	1
This battery is exactly what is advertised , a genuine Motorola BR50 battery . It is not a knock off . As such , it works exactly the way you would expect a Motorola battery to work , for much less money .	1
We 've been using 2 of these batteries for ten days now with no problems at all . They were new in appearance and we did charge them with the phones off for 12 hours prior to the first use . Follow up review - It 's been 2 full months now since we bought these batteries and they are still working perfectly .	1
The batteries were exactly as advertised , they were delivered in a normal timeframe , there were no issues or hiccups or drama with the vendor . It was `` slam , bam , thank you , sirs or madams . '' Battery life is really subjective as everyone 's `` normal '' is different . But life is definitely restored compared to my original 2 year old battery . My experience is use of Bluetooth really drains batteries quickly . But that 's a Bluetooth issue that goes away if you do n't use Bluetooth . I have no complaints at all with this product .	1
It fits the RAZR just like the original battery made by Motorola . It worked perfectly for me as a second battery for those days when it is just too much effort to find the charger .	1
My Razr V3 after two years would n't hold a charge . Both Cingular & Verizon stores offered replacements batteries that cost almost as much as the phone did new . For under $ 10 bucks this replacement gave my phone a new lease on life . It is an exact replacement and not some knockoff . Great talk and standby time .	1
The battery goes into a 5 year old cell phone and it was not available in any local stores . The price was right and I have been using it for about a month w/o problems ...	1
It looks good and was easy to pair . It fits nicely and looked as described in the ad , Shipping was right on the money .	1
I have a Nokia 6230 and purchased this headset from Compusa recently . Used to have a Nokia HDW-3 but the battery died and unable to find a cheap replacement battery.Pros : The unit is solidly made and easy to setup . The mute function work well , the volume is good ( no DSP ) and sound quality matches my old Nokia . Unlike a lot of loop headsets , this does n't seem like it 'll break/fall off as I tend to put it in my pocket when unused.Pairs fine with my Mac and you can turn off the blue light if needed . Charger is a small flip-prong type and reasonable at 2 hours to charge . Battery talk time is good although it 's unclear what type of battery it has internally . The audio cues are fairly logical.Cons : Not the most comfortable headset I 've tried . Prefer the in-ear like the Sony HBH-IV835 but I decided to keep this one instead as DSP might suck .	1
What 's hot : Very Slim portfolio , Stereo Bluetooth , integration with iTunes music , Good Call QualityWhat 's not : Flush keyboard makes for difficult navigation , expensive , non-standard headphone jackThe verdict : The SLVR offers a RAZR- inspired level of thinness , and the metal construction/large display create an air of confidence for users . Call quality is good , although I detected some echoing during my testing . Battery life is only average at 3-4 days with moderate usage , and the phone is occasionally sluggish in JAVA game applications.The camera itself produces decent quality shots for quick MMS texts and web postings . The camera is also capable of producing video recording which can then be played back in the media center , though resolution is quite low . I would have liked to see a standard 3.5mm headphone jack , but the L7 requires either an adapter or by wireless Bluetooth usage.Overall , although the SLVR iTunes phone is the first of it 's kind , its hampered by so-so performance and a high price tag . The keyboard , though fashionable , is flush with the surface- something which wo n't please text message fans .	1
I bought the SLVR for my wife and a RAZR for my self . People who want iTunes should buy their phones through a service provider who includes it on the phone . Our unlocked SLVR ( apparently produced for use in Europe ... it came with European plug and a US adapter ) did not come with iTunes . Having read the reviews I expected this . My wife uses her phone primarily for talking and text messaging . The SLVR has worked well for this . The only issue is that some of the shortcuts do n't work . The main one missing is the one which you use to lock your keypad so that buttons are not accidently pressed . We get this message saying shortcut not available on this phone . Other than this small annoyance my wife and I really like the phone . We 're living in Hungary right now and the SLVR is not sold here , so it 's extra cool for others to see . The small , thin form factor is great . I 'm almost tempted to get one of these to replace my RAZR !	1
Some specifics about my experience , and usage tips ; I 'll leave it to others to do an overview : Out of the box , this is NOT a great phone . It took a LOT of effort to learn and customize in order to use it effectively , but after that , it 's very good . If and only if you 're up for the effort , I highly recommend the phone . Older phones I 've had were much more usable out of the box.MENUS : I changed the home screen buttons around to have the items I use the most - SMS , recent calls , and calendar , and to put phone book where I 'm used to it being . I also changed menu order . Some moron put Tools under the Settings menu ; that ca n't be fixed . Since when is a Tool a kind of Setting ? Maybe it makes more sense in whatever language the developers speak.PHONE BOOK.I changed the phone book listing format - this was CRUCIAL to making it usable . It has its own Setup menu , separate from Settings . These made it usable , especially View and View by : -- View by : list , Sort by : name , View : Primary Contacts , Search Method : Jump To . I synchronize my phone book with my Mac iBook using the FREE iSync , for easy data entry and for backup.STORAGE : ESSENTIAL : I changed where it stores images , games , and ringtones ( from the phone to the memory card ) , which allowed me to transfer images to my computer , transfer games to & from my computer ( e.g . cellufun 's free sudoku , chess , etc . ) , and use an mp3 as a ringtone . This should be possible from the phone 's internal memory , but it is n't , so WOW - knowing that this change makes is possible makes the phone MUCH BETTER than I thought it was at first . Also , these settings ( and some others too ) get lost if the phone loses power and have to be reset ; this is LAME ! BLUETOOTH : It works well with the cardo scala-500 I got from amazon . I set up a shortcut for quickly enabling bluetooth when I am wearing my headset . FYI , if you get a bluetooth headset , be warned that it ca n't be used to listen to music ; in fact , if you have a bluetooth headset active , it refuses to play music through the built-in speaker . [ Edit : it does work with some ( unspecified ) bluetooth headsets , according to the manual ; Update : BUT , I 've tried 3 bluetooth headset models and they did n't work . The SLVR does n't support the required protocol , A2DP , so I think the statement in the manual is false . ] iTunes : Very good ! I just wish it would remember what songs it had already played . [ Edit : maybe the repeat all option does that ; it 's undocumented ; trying it now ... ] PRICE : I got mine for $ 50 with contract renewal from cingular ~Mar '06 ; a billing dispute took such a huge effort to resolve that the office of the president staff let me get it at that price.I 've yet to figure out how to use the free EDGE I have grandfathered on my account to browse the Internet at no charge . I 've called , but have n't reached a clueful cingular support rep yet .	1
The case is easy to use and hold securely to my belt or waistband . My phone is easy to put in and get out when I want it out , but remains secure when I do n't need it.The only problem I had is with the belt clip . It came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip . The belt clip is very tight , and the second time I put it on my belt , the leather covering it tore and came off . It really did n't affect the functioning at all , but I was annoyed that something I just purchased came apart on the second use .	1
This case is almost perfect for my Palm Treo 700 . The fit is great . The leather is soft and of very high quality . The magnetic closure is the best I 've seen , with no alignment required yet very secure . The one exception is the belt clip . It takes three men and a dog to get it on or off the belt ! It is so tight that I think you could tear the case getting it on or off unless you pry it off with something like a pen . I do n't know what they were thinking putting such a tight clip on such a great case .	1
I am a die hard Treo 600 user . This is best case I 've ever owned . I already wore out this exact case over a 3 year period and just bought another one . It is a perfect fit with the antenna on the Treo 600 or 650 .	1
I like the case very much . The quality of the leather and clip seem good . I have had one other case that had a stronger magnetic closure -- that would be my only suggestion.The case is slightly roomier than some and has a pocket in which a couple of SD cards can be stored . Unlike some others , I can actually fit my Treo 650 with a `` skin '' case in this leather pouch .	1
This is the Palm OEM version and fits great and looks as good . After 3 months , no issues at all . Also has two small pockets for SD cards which is not noted in the ad . Great value , about 40 % less than what Palm was selling it for .	1
I spent a good bit of time reading Amazon reviews about Treo cases . Most of the cases had very mixed reviews . My Palm One Treo 700/650 Pouch Leather Case is stylish with a nice soft leather . At first my Treo moved around a little in the case . This little movement was not very noticable or bothersome . After I remembered the little pocket inside the case , I put 4 business cards inside . These were just enough to keep my Treo from moving . Actually the pocket ca n't really hold more than 4 or 5 business cards without making it difficult to close the Treo in the case . I really like the magnetic flap . It 's easy to open and close . Finally the belt clip holds securely on my belt .	1
The only thing that I can add to the the reviews already posted on this device is my own experiences - we ordered 2 of the 'bulk packaged ' bundles which include the headset and the charger.Positives : - No earbud going into the ear - this is a BIG positive because I ca n't stand those and , apparently they are not good for you.- Quick charging.- Easy to pair - in my case with a Razr and a Blackberry.- Easy to turn on/off , by simply folding/unfolding the microphone boom.- Pretty good instructions.Negatives : - My wife complains that the sound quality is not always perfect.- Being as small as it is , perhaps some carrying pouch should have been included.At this time , my wife decided to keep hers but she will give the second one to her girlfriend as a birthday present : )	1
This is a good blue tooth . I can hear great with this product . My husband had a problem with it , that is was n't load enough for him . He drives truck . Just a little bulky for my taste . This is the first blue tooth I had when I got my first blue tooth compatible phone . Had lots of them.The only draw back is . They only lasted about six months and we had to get new one . And the product does pick up allot of background noise . But it does work well . Would recommend this to others .	1
Very happy with this headset - thank you ! I do n't have any problems or complaints . H700 is a nice upgrade from H500 .	1
But you wont find a better choice at this time . The on off switch by folding the headset and the easy to push buttons make all the difference in the world . Do n't believe me , then purchase the Jabra or one of the other headsets , place it in your pocket or purse and answer a call from your phone . Chances are you will have forgotten to turn the unit off and your caller will be live wherever you left your Bluetooth headset within 30 feet . The H700 folds when you take it off your ear and when it folds , it turns off . Sounds good reasonably priced and effective , Its that simple ! !	1
I just got mine after reading several reviews on this model . The biggest and only complaint is the range . You DO NOT get 25 feet range and to be honest you have to hold the phone on the same side as your bluetooth just so you do n't get static . I found there is no perfect bluetooth and their very expensive so this is okay if the range is the only problem I have I keep it in my pocket anyway . My calls are clear , but I must add sometimes the phone disconnects from the bluetooth and I am answering my phone saying hello not realizing this .	1
The Motorola h-700 is great for the price I paid . I used to have a H800 so I decided to tried the H700 that is smaller.great device ! ! !	1
It 's lite , comfortable , sound is good and no one that I 've talked to has commented that my phone sounds different . I did however have a problem getting it to pair . I had to go online to figure it out since the directions that came with it were poor . I could not get the light to stop blinking blue and it has to be purple to pair . The online directions said to close the mic , hold down the button until it turns purple and then open the mic . That 's not really correct either . You have to open the mic while your finger is holding the button down . They forgot to mention that important step . I ca n't tell you how many times I had to do it before figuring that one out . That said it works well and pairing was easy after getting the light to turn purple . Obviously with the 5 stars I gave it I 'm recommending it.UPDATE : February 11 , 2009 The Bluetooth has slowly died . People were no longer able to hear me . They said it sounded like I was miles away . I took very good car of the unit , always kept it in a case and was worn maybe two hours a day on average . I tried cleaning the mic but it did n't help . It lasted a year and a half so I guess I got my moneys worth . Just thought you 'd like to know .	1
I 've paired mine with a Razr V3 black and a Razr V3i without any issues . The sound is perfect , no static or other interference . Callers on the other end can hear me clearly and vice versa . This is very lightweight and portable and I can not recommend this enough ! The only thing I want to mention is that when I purchased this a while back , the getting started guide was outdated and gave me an older sequence of steps for pairing the device , so it was frustrating in the beginning until I realized that the instructions were wrong . I went online to Motorola and got the proper set of instructions , and voila , perfect !	1
I have been using this for almost a year now , and can not live without it . The quality of this product is great , it may not be as cheap as others , but its worth it . The most important factor of this is quality of voice , even if I am outside , driving or walking , voice quality is very clear .	1
After losing my cell phone to a lake while flyfishing i decided it was time to try and avoid that mistake . I LOVE this guy i actually bought another one of these ( a larger size ) . I can pretty much let it sit beside me in the water and it will float and not take on any water . It is the best enclosure for valuables . I took this to a theme park where i knew there would be water rides and it still protected . I also used this on the beach to protect my phone . It kept my phone out of the sandy elements . I recommend this product . Any questions please ask i am always looking for advice so i enjoy giving it when i can as well .	1
After all the water damage we had after Hurricane Ike , I decided to get something to protect my cell phone if , God forbid , we have more hurricane damage . My Samsung Captivate fits just fine , so I 'm happy with it.Other reviwers said it works great , so I 'll just have to take their word for it . Actually , I hope I never have to find out how great it works .	1
Seems to do a good job preventing fluid flow into or out of the box . Would recommend this product to others .	1
Very handy case to keep you valuables or electronics safe from the elements . Performs as expected and is roomy enough for an iphone with a thick protective case . Great if its gon na be exposed to water or dirt and sand while marching through the wilderness .	1
nice solid case with hard foam lining , its held up well and kept contents inside dry , clips are solid and case is rugged .	1
WHAT CAN YOU SAY , DIFFERENT SIZES FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED . I REALLY LIKE THEM , I HAVE SIX IN TWO DIFFERENT SIZES . I JUST WISH THEY WERE A LITTLE CHEAPER , BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR . I ALWAYS SAY IF YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PRICE DO N'T BUY IT . BUT TRUTH BE TOLD THESE ARE REALLY GREAT . JUST CHECK INSIDE AND OUTSIDE DIMEMSIONS .	1
Took this to Hawaii so I could keep my stuff safe while in the water . It would only fit either my cell phone or my camera , not both ( plus some cash , credit cards , keys , coins , etc ) . My cell phone is small ( smaller than iphone ) , and normal size point-and-shoot camera . The strap is very uncomfortable though when u go underwater ( for a long time , like snorkeling ) ... the whole thing spins and squeezes your wrist ... and it hurts . Other than that , it kept everything dry the whole time .	1
My water sport activities are on hold for the winter , so I put the otterbox in a bucket of water , set a brick on it and walked away for a half hour or so , dry as desert sand inside upon retrieving . Good sense dictates a test without expensive electronics inside , now I can use it with full confidence that wallet , iphone , etc . will be safe .	1
Am very satisfied with this case . It arrived in a timely mannerand was just as advertised . If you want a leak proof case forcell phone or whatever , this is a good buy . MC	1
like every otterbox product i have owned this is well built and does its job well . great protection for anything that fits in it .	1
This case is mega study . I bought this because I go kayaking with my dad.The case is big enough to fit my IPhone and IPod in their perfectly ( with their protective cases ) , without them moving around in there.Length wise , for just storing those 2 items it 's a bit big , but at the same time its not big enough for me to squeeze my wallet in there as well.Size wise , I would have preferred a little smaller to perfectly fit the phones , or a bit longer to fit something else in there as well.That 's my fault though . You can read about the sizes but I never seem to picture it right until I have the product sitting right in front of me.But it gets the job done . I recommend .	1
Good product . Very durable and waterproof . Good for camping and kayaking . Easy to use and works well with other sizes in the system .	1
I 'll make this short and sweet ... I 've had the phone for a month now . * This phone has excellent reception* Wi-fi and edge data works perfect to access the web* Gmail works perfectly and automatically ( but took some figuring out to set up - you have to go to mytmobile.com to set it up ) * I use gmail and google calendar/spreadsheets/etc - I do n't use the outlook features . * The handwriting recognition is awesome , but I have no use for it . * Works perfectly with my bluetooth earset* Voice dialing actually works really well ! * The built-in word/excel and pdf viewer work perfectly . * Works perfectly with my GPS - a TomTom Go 910 - to get live traffic updates and weather.My only issues : * The keyboard - I 'm glad it 's qwerty , but there 's got to be a better way to type in numbers ! This took me about a week to get used to . There should just be an extra row for numbers . * Typing a number in is n't bad , but I wish the touch screen keypad was just a bit larger . There 's a downloadable application to just say the numbers to dial , but I have n't tried it yet .	1
It is a bit clunky..that is the bad news . All the rest is good.The phone is terrific as a phone . It has good clear sound , an easy interface , and helpful links to your contacts.The browswer feature is awesome . Edge-enabling means you have virtual 24/7 access to the internet , and to your email through the web or an Outlook style program.The 1.3 MP camera is more than adequate for the opportunity shots when you do not have your camera handy.This is a far superior product to a Blackberry unless you need push . I do not , but I have heard push software can be downloaded.I have had Pocket PC 's in the past , and had no learning curve with the program . The reality is however it is quite user-friendly and takes little time to master .	1
I like my phone i got it the first day it came out and when i got it i mean it takes some getting use to but I like the features , the camera , the phone is ok not wow , love the keyboard , and i really like my windows media player on it and all the things you can do . I do n't know what most people were expecting but i think my expection of the phone is what i expected ... .Until someone finds the perfect phone that has no problems , have everything you ever wanted , absolutely no issue with it and it does every possible thing , then you let me know but for now this phone is ok/good	1

Nearly 10 years later , this T-Mobile MDA still works . I popped in the battery and was amazed she 's still chugging along , and located my Wi-Fi connection without any hesitation . I had purchased the MDA solely for use of a custom-designed business application that worked under the Windows Mobile operating system . The company that wrote the app for me is long gone , but the MDA still works . The MDA 's full-sized pull-out keyboard was amazing quality for the time , in an era when on-screen Blackberry keyboards were the standard.The only reason I 'm not using this phone anymore is because I ca n't get a decent T-Mobile phone signal where I currently live and work . The phone still works excellent as a data and texting device . I had to switch to Verizon and an iPhone in order to get a decent cell phone signal.If you can find one cheap enough , it 's an interesting little device to use with Wi-Fi . The MDA used to be a real guy magnet . Nobody had ever seen a phone like this before , and total strangers would come up and ask me about it . I upgraded to a G1 , the first Android-based phone , and then immediately ditched it and went back to my beloved MDA .	1
I had no trouble using this I have a Razr v3r . I downloaded songs to my 1-gig media card and I can use any song as a ringtone . I also loaded pictures from my computer to my phone . Great and amazon had the best price bar none	1
I love this product , I received it in the mail last week , loaded it and moved pictures , made my own ring tones . Loaded the phone book , into outlook express . It worked great ! My daughter and her girl friend both downloaded ring tones , and downloaded pictures without any problems .	1
The price I paid for this package was good , but the cost of shipping negated the low price . I had seen lower price from other web retailer , $ 8 with free shipping . Most advertizements online include just one cable . This phone tool package has two cables , one for mini-USB and one for other non-mimi-USB phones . I guess the extra cable is worth a few dollars . The software does not have much on it , but you need it to manage your phone book on your cell phone and to make your own mp3 ring tones and upload to it . Other phone maker like Samsung , you can download similar utilities for free from their website .	1
This is a great utility for simplifying some of the most common tasks such as archiving phone numbers and for transferring ringtones and graphics from a computer to the phone using USB , Infrared or Bluetooth connection.The setup was fairly straightforward and the menus intuitive.I am very satisfied with the product .	1
The GoodThis program can be great . I use it to sync my phone with Outlook 2003 , to transfer pictures and video to my phone and to create ringtones from my favorite audio CD's.It works great with Outlook 2003 , I am running Windows XP Home Edition . I am not sure about Mac users . It works best when you use a data cable.My Motorala Phone Tools software was purchased a couple of years ago for my Motorola V660 . My toddler tossed my phone into the full washing machine while I was adding fabric softner to a load of laundry . They do n't still make my old phone , my insurance replaced it with a V3.I lost my ringtones and address book . My husband already had a data cable for the V3 phone so I just plugged my phone in hoping it would allow me to sync with outlook ( He took his data cable to work but I found a replacement on Amazon for less than $ 5.00 ) . Imagine my surprise when the software recognized a new phone promped me to update the software to Phone Tools 4.0 and install a profile for the new phone . All I had to do was copy all my old information on to my new phone and go.The BadThis does not work on every Motorola Phone . If you want to be sure it will work with your phone then I suggest you go to the BVRP/Avanquest website and check to see if your phone is compatable before you purchase the software . It is cheaper at Amazon and you get the disk if you need to reinstall the program both pluses when buying this software.Not a one size fits all program ; if you want something just for Ringtones I would suggest Ringtone Media Studio 2 also by BVRP/Avanquest.The UglyThe bluetooth just does not work well and when I tried to use it it was just plain frustrating so I subtracted one star . Bluetooth had been out long enough for them to make this work.I am not a techie I just want technology to work for me with as little hassle as possible - I 'm busy I just want it to do what it should and I am happy this program still works for me two years and one phone later .	1
I 've read a number of reviews on the MPT4 and was a bit skeptical . I had just replaced an Audiovox PPC4100 PDA phone which was stolen with a new Motorola KRZR K1 . I did not know whether this would efficiently replace the effective but cumbersome PDA I 've had for so many years.After initially installing the MPT4 software it did an update but when I started the program it could not find my new KRZR K1 . The software worked fine with my wife 's Razor V3 . After a few tries I realized the program would update itself everytime I turned it on till it finally reached the latest version 4.1.2 . After that it would sync the KRZR with my PC with no problem whatsoever ! Although I 've had to adjust to a number of things , one must also understand the program 's limitations , the use of this software has definately exploited the KRZR 's full potential . I 've created different profiles on my laptop , store computer and home computer . and both my wife and I have no problems using it . I definately recommend the program and just advice the user to update the software to it 's latest version.Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 for all Motorola Phones [ Motorola Retail Packaging ]	1
I love this headset . It 's lightweight , easy to adjust for right or left ear , with clear sound on both talk and listen . This headset sounds great when talking , unlike others that sound faint to the listener . It 's very clear to listen with , and comfortable due to it 's lightweight design so one can leave it on for hours . To switch ears , you simply pivot the ear bud and voila , it fits the other ear . It has a mute and volume control , but I never use them since my phone has a mute button on it and the volume is adjusted the way I like it.I really like this headset and would buy again if I lost it.Plantronics MX505-X1 Windsmart Boom Headset with 2.5mm Plug ( Black and Gray )	1
I like the convenience of blue tooth and wireless , but our family keeps coming back to this top quality wired headset for sound quality . We use it so much that we just wear ours out , because we use them periodically for travel with our mobile phones , but also have them on our portable home phones . If I know that I am going to be in some wind I will use this headset instead of my wireless - just as a comparison and I use a Plantronics Voyager Pro Plus and it is a great wireless headset , but for real sound quality on both ends you ca n't beat the Plantronics MX500 series . I hope they keep them around for a while .	1
I have had a few of these ( broke them , totally my fault ) and I use them with the adapter for my Android phone . I am very sensitive about clients and calls with press people hearing me clearly , easily and consistently . I take this headset and the sister 3-in-1 version any day over several bluetooth headsets I have purchased over the years . I know its an older product , but it works extremely well . If they made them out of Titanium , I would buy it at almost any price because I have trashed ( again , my fault , dog ate one , I crushed the other ) two of them . Thankfully they are inexpensive .	1
I bought a Plantronics bluetooth headsetPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headsetfor the car and was extremely happy with it . I wanted to leave it in the car , though , because I knew if I took it with me when I got out , I would never remember to put it back in the car . I decided to get a wired headset to keep in my briefcase because , despite being very technically literate , I 'm still leary about something emitting radio waves stuck in my ear all day . The MX505 has been great . Most importantly , it 's durable . It also has good sound quality and the people I call have no trouble hearing me .	1
The C139 is the cheapest model in Tracfone 's lineup . It 's a very good basic phone that gives you good voice clarity and easy text messaging . Because Tracfone does n't have a lot of services to offer ( which is n't a bad thing for people who only want basic cellular service ) , this phone does n't give you music downloads or live TV ( which on other carriers are mostly misleading hype anyway ) . The color screen is small but good-quality . The only thing I do n't like is Tracfone 's 60-day refill polic : you must refill every 60 days to keep your account active ; otherwise you forfeit your number and balance . Other prepaid providers like Speak Out Wireless ( from 7-Eleven ) give you one full year of usage .	1
If you have a child who you want to carry a cell phone , but do n't want to pay lots of money for all of the extras ( or if you yourself just want a `` basic '' phone ) , this is a good value for the money . Large screen displays numbers very clearly . Sound quality is good . Battery life is a little short and the phone can not be used while it is charging ( that 's a pretty big negative , IMO ) . But overall , this is a good starter phone and serves the purpose . If you just want a dependable phone to carry with you in case of emergencies , this phone fits the bill nicely .	1
I bought this phone because I was sick of Sprint 's contracts . It has been great for the following reasons : - cheap ( $ 13 ) - superb coverage : I travel coast to coast and even get service in the backwoods of rural Alabama ( Costa Rica too ) - battery lasts and lasts ( and lasts ) - easy to useAll I wanted was a phone that worked . After previously owning the $ 700 mini-computer type phone I was ready to kick 'em all to the curb but this has been great . If you 're tired of the high charges and contract hassles , give this a try . I spent $ 100 on 1200 minutes and a year 's worth of service.The only caveat to this service is that you get dinged for an entire minute even if you only used 2 seconds of it . But with all the other good stuff that it does have , that little detail does n't bother me a bit !	1
This is a great product . Works just like the name brand product . have n't had no problem with the product . And the price is allot better than the name brand one . Why pay for the name when you have a product like this . Would recommend this product to everyone .	1
Good product for the money.Havent had any problems with it and is cheap enough to forget in a friends car	1
I received in great time and it was as if brought out of the store.Very basic but does the job.Thanks ,	1
I 've had this thing for years now , and use it all the time . At one point I went to plug my USB cord in without looking and totally smashed the internal stuff up inside the top ! I thought it was broken , however after finding something small to push the innerds back down to where the cord would once again fit inside , it 's worked just fine . Never cuts out or anything . I still have to be careful , otherwise I 'll push the internal casing back upwards - I 'm sure I broke some little stabilizer - but I can get it back down easily . I 'm impressed .	1
There 's really not much to say other than the adapter works like I expected it to . I bought it to charge my cell phone in my truck , and it definitely does that .	1
it works really good . i dont even have to worry if i cant charge my phone in the house . i love this item and it is easy to carry anywhere you go .	1
This dry bag works very well . I own several that close by wrapping the top several times . This closure uses the rotating tabs to lock the bag shut . It is a great way to seal the bag . I tested it after receiving it . It passed with flying colors .	1
Went on a cruise , wanted something waterproof for cell phone and wallet contents while on the beach or doing activities where stuff might get wet . This little number fit the bill quite well . Durable plastic , clever latches that work well to seal the top . I leak tested it before leaving , and was impressed with the seal . When we went snorkelling there were free lockers to use , so I did n't actually use it IN the water , but I would have felt safe doing so if lockers were n't available . We like to canoe during the summer , this will be much more convenient for cell phones , etc , than the larger dry bag I have been using . My wife was impressed enough with mine that she wants one by summertime . Recommend !	1
I used this to go to a water park . I didnt do any swimming but walked through a lot of sprinklers . Phone was fine and i could use the touch screen while in the case .	1
I wish the backside was clear so you could access your camera on your phone . Otherwise it does what it says .	1
It does it 's job well . My smart phone fits in it & you can use it through the plastic . I took it fishing & worked like a charm . I think it 's well worth the money .	1
I 've fallen in the water kayaking a few times with my iPod Touch and LG Xenon in these cases . They 've been submerged in water for a few minutes and survived . Have n't had any issues with humidity inside the pack , but I 'm not a heavy user of my cell phone or Touch while paddling .	1
But at this price you'de be better off using ziploc bags or something equally inexpensive . This does have a nice landyard and will keep your phone dry .	1
It is important not to drop the remote control in the lake due to high cost of replacement . this case is exactly the right size and since it has clear front the remote can be operated without opening the case a winner	1
Is a good and practice bag , regular quality , work well , for the price , is the product that company offer satisfaction with the purchase	1
While fishing I 'd used an identical but & # 34 ; brand name & # 34 ; dry pak that was loaned by a friend . The Kwik Tek is , as I said identical , but a good bit cheaper . Waterproof and mudproof protection for my iPhone that I 've used fishing and working outside in damp , muddy conditions . Some padding provides additional protection from drops and bumps . Should float with most devices , especially if you leave some air inside . Except for the camera , phone and apps are fully functional although I prefer to remove it for talking . Lanyard provides a bit of extra security that I have n't yet needed but will when kayaking . Between uses to assure inside is totally dry , it is a good idea to prop open to air or drop in one of those silica packs . Guess you could get some protection from a baggie , but at this low price the Kwik Tek is cheap insurance for your phone and priceless data .	1
With buying a $ 400 cell phone out of pocket I was n't going to take any chances on it . This pouch saved my phone 's life ! I attached the pouch to my mountain bike with large rubberized bands ( made for the purpose ) that stretch and wrap around the bars and have loops on the end to stretch around the phone.I unexpectedly sank and tipped over in a small stream my phone and bike became caked in mud . I washed off the case in a river and my phone was just fine on the inside . This pouch has become coveted by fellow mountain bikers who do it without protection ... on their phones .	1
Once before I tried ordering a Blackberry battery on line and it turned out to be a fake knockoff . This is NO fake knockoff . It works great .	1
Worked well . I got it because my phone kept shutting off . After I got it , my phone was fine . Had good life . But then after a while , my phone started to shut off again . So it was probably just my phone with the problem .	1
Made a decision early this year to pick up a newBlackBerry Curve 8330as a better method of communicating with clients and family . Had seen reviews that averaged 4.4 out of 5 , so it seemed to be a decent choice . This turned out to be one of the best decisions made this year , as the BlackBerry turned out to be far better than expected ... it was faster than my previous phone , reliable , versatile and rugged , and there were few dropped calls . But the phone had one simple problem : it 's a battery eater ! Went to my cell phone provider to see about getting an extra battery , and was surprised to find that the standard 1000 mAh OEM Lithium Ion battery cost was almost $ 45.00 . That seemed a bit steep , so I began searching here on Amazon.com and found this Blackberry Li-Ion [ OEM ] C-S2 Battery . Was cautious because of the extreme price difference , but figured that if it was truly an OEM C-S2 battery , it was worth the gamble.Examined it when it arrived , and found that it not only had the original BlackBerry logo , but was marked C-S2 on the face , the correct version for my phone ( and many other BlackBerry models ) . The back listed it as a Lithium Ion Battery , 3.7V , with a capacity of 1150mAh 4.3Wh ... identical to my original battery . So it was charged overnight , as had done when the phone was first received with the original battery.It was good choice , as the battery has been a perfect backup to my original . It has function just the same as the original C-S2 battery , and there seems to be no difference . Went on to buy a second backup , just because it seemed to be a good idea for those `` better safe than sorry '' situations . Must admit that I do use the built-in GPS quite a bit , and that along with frequent 'Net access , probably accounts for my need of extra battery power . Might note that I picked up anExternal Battery Charger For Blackberry 8300 8320 8330 , which has been the perfect compliment to these batteries.One might note that the prices on the BlackBerry C-S2 OEM batteries seem to vary quite a bit here , but most seem to come in well under $ 7.00 ... far less that what the cell phone retailers are charging . Do your searching here on Amazon.com and you 'll find some excellent prices on these.If your battery seems to not last as long as the original specs for the BlackBerry stated , you can argue with the retailer ... or waste far less time and get one of these C-S2 OEM batteries here . Giving it a 5-star rating without any hesitation at all .	1
Great battery at a super price . I can not compare to the higher rated & lt ; life > batteries . But this works great for original spec . I get a days worth of use easy . I do keep charged .	1
This battery is perfect for Blackberry 8700 , it has long standby time and quick to charge , eforcity 's delivery was speedy too .	1
The price is good and the cable is working well . I had a very good experience with this cable .	1
Cable connects directly to phone allowing you to use the Nokia Phone tools , contact management and even USB mass storage .	1
This Data cable allowed me to access my Nokia 6085 ( Black ) phone 's memory and Firmware update using Nokia Suite , It does what it is designed for.PROS : ( + ) CheapCONS : ( - ) May not last for multiple uses as the port connector on the cable may eventually break over time.Notes : ( * ) DO NOT use the Driver CD that comes with the product	1
Not a single glitch . Fair priced and FAST shipping . NO problems or hassles connecting and syncing using Windows XP OR Vista . What 's not to love ?	1
I did not like how the tablet case with keyboard had the wire for the keyboard sticking out of the case . An easy way to get it caught on something and do damage . This works great to keep the wire for the keyboard inside the area of the case where it is more protected .	1
Does exactly what it 's supposed to do : allow you to plug in a Mini-USB plug into a place you could n't fit it before because of the angle .	1
This device is a small attachment for any of the Navigon 2100 , 5100 or 7100 series GPS.For some reason , Navigon decided to place the charger receptacle on the BOTTOM ( facing downwards ) of their units . This makes little difference if you use the windshield suction cup to hold and display your unit . However , if you use the adhesive disc for the dash then the charger cord will likely have to be bent at right angles to make the connection , as its receptacle on the GPS points straight down . This device , when attached to the GPS , allows allows the charger cord to come in from the side , eliminating any acute bending of the cord.Conclusion : A helpful device for all Navigon GPS units ; intend for those users who wish to have their unit mounted to the dash . 5 Stars	1
I have a very nice Bluetooth headphset with a power connector that is simply not accessible by the cable unless I charge it unfolded . The design is really bad for me as I want to be able to charge it folded . The right angle adapter is just what I needed and the price was right . It works pretty well for me , so I am giving it 4 stars.I have to be a little nit-picky , but I actually would have preferred a & # 34 ; left & # 34 ; angle connector -- the right angle works for me , but a connector pointed in the other direction would have worked even better . Note that the connector exactly matches the picture in the product description so I knew what I was getting ahead of time . I just wanted to get something that apparently nobody makes . Anyway , if you need the right angle , then it will be a 5 star review for you .	1
I am using this to keep my Garmin Nuvi 360 powered up while driving . I did n't know this when I got it , but if the Garmin is plugged in and not using battery power , it automatically turns on when the car is turned on ( that 's what I get for not reading the instruction manual , lol ) .To have a cleaner appearance in the car , I have the mini-usb plugged into the ball mount that is holding the GPS and not plugged into the GPS itself . Unfortunately , that port is really close to the ball mount which restricts it 's movement when plugged in . With the adapter , it makes the cable less intrusive and makes the GPS free to adjust with the ball mount to nearly any position desired . In combination with a 1.50 mini-usb cable , probably the cheapest way to keep my Nuvi charged while driving ! !	1
Just what I needed , to run the cord to my GPS mounted in my car . It does not trigger the Garmin to go into USB PC-connected mode , like some USB right angle cords will do .	1
I thought this help to have good look for my two devices but this is important at last because I need to modify mini USB which is not easy from the cable but this one has small PCB inside that is giving me a room to add resistor . Thank you seller .	1
I love being able to use these with my phone and MP3 player . It is so neat to hear a person talking in stereo . I love this product . It is well worth the money .	1
The BT620s is a fine little gadget . It works well , sounds great , is easy to use and compatible with my bluetooth devices . It does n't quite fit my giant head so well though . It 's a little tight on my ears , but not painful . I imagine that it will loosen up over time . The problem is that when the headphones sit idle , they bend in so that in order to fit them on your ears you have to flex them out , which creates quite a bit of tension . The actual flexing plastic part seems fairly durable , so I 'm not worried about breakage.The package comes with a mini-usb wall charger , a mini-usb to usb cable an extra set of foam ear pads , a bag for your headset and the headset itself of course . So for $ 40 , this is a fantastic deal for something that I imagine works just as well as the more expensive competitors and has a comparable comfort level.The weight of the device is not too much . As I said , the only problem I have is with the comfort . Smaller heads would probably find it even more comfortable than my gargantuan melon . Now I 'm going to go cry myself to sleep on my huge pilla .	1
I purchased the Jabra A125s Bluetooth iPod Adapter along with the Jabra BT620s Bluetooth Headphone and have enjoyed both . They were easy to set up and since they are both from the same manufacturer they both use the same charger so I do not have any extra ones to worry about and I always have a spare to take with me when I am gone for long periods of time.The only suggestions that I would have would be for a positive connection to my iTouch ; as it is now it is too easy to wiggle out just enough so that the connection is not good and I have to push it back in.Of course this only happens when I am walking it works great when I am just lounging around listening to tunes .	1
I think these are pretty good headphones when compared with an older set of Logitech bluetooth headphones . These ones are much more comfortable for a longer time and do n't seem so fragile . I love how there 's a built-in microphone for voice . I 've used this before with my phone and while people may give you strange looks while talking the person on the phone seemed to hear me just fine.I think these are also great to use when a cable often gets in the way . I enjoy using these if I 'm taking a bike ride . I have an adapter for my ipod which I use with these . My only complaint is if I go to the gym with these on . I can hear music fine if the volume is up , however if I 'm watching a show on my iPod then often times I ca n't hear much of the dialogue . So in those situations I end up using my ear buds . I 'd say the sound quality is alright . I 'm not an audiophile but I do usually have a good ear for sound quality . The battery life on these seems good and I like how they can charge with a standard mini-usb connection.I 've had 1 problem that 's probably worth sharing . Between pairing the headphones for different devices I sometimes had an issue and then it would n't pair to anything . So I 'd shut them off , plug them into a PC which is powered on . After a few seconds I 'd disconnect it and when I tried to pair them up again it would work . I am not sure of the cause and did n't try plugging them into a regular power source to see if that fixes it . So just a warning if any of you come across this problem too . It does n't happen every time and is n't a deal breaker for me .	1
I should say I right now that I do n't own a cell phone so I ca n't verify the microphone part of this thing - only the music part . It 's a bit funky to get used to , like learning all the colors and flashing LED 's , beeps or the controls . It 's also a bit heaver then normal headphones because of the batteries . I recommend you do n't read the getting started guide , rather jump right into the user manual.You should get in the package : 1 BT620s headset , 1 USB to USB mini cord , 1 AC adapter , getting started guide , and user manual , spare pair of ear cushions , and finally a carrying bag.I was a little overwhelmed of the things it says it can do , so I thought it had about 10 buttons on each side . Actually , both sides have 3 identical buttons ( the big center button , and up and downs ( left : volume , right : jump tracks or FF or RW ) . The left big button is for phone control AND turning the power on and off and activating discovery mode . The right big button just pauses , plays.The user guide explains the the length of holding the button down does different things . For example : to turn it on , press the left button for a second . To turn off , hold the same button for 5 seconds . To turn on discovery mode - hold it for 5 seconds while OFF . Cool beeping sounds tells you what is about to happen.It sounds great . All the buttons that are applicable work ( all but phone ) . Good range . The manual claims that the purpose for the usb to mini usb is so you can charge and wirey listen to music from your computer . But it did n't work for me - it only allowed me to charge . But you should be able to charge your headset where ever there is a powered USB port : PC 's , PlayStation 2 ! It 's too uncomfortable having a thick usb wire hanging and and tied to my PC while listening to music anyway.The AC charger is cool because it 's wider instead of longer then normal AC adapters so you can fit another plug below it . There was absolutely no mention of the carrying bag ANYWHERE . It still wo n't protect from the elements or drops or crushing it . It 's cool for reusing it as little things I guess.As for all behind the ear headphones , lying in bed is really uncomfortable , especially if your a side sleeper.And , unlike the logitech , NO signs of cracking on the band.Cons : I never want to see the flashing two blue LED 's ( steaming stereo ) . It is possible to turn them off but they always seem to find a way back on ; a little heavy ; no user replaceable battery.EDIT : 5/8/11It 's been sitting in a box for years , so I charged and paired it up . I do n't know whats happened to it , maybe the band got slightly bent but it 's really uncomfortable behind the ears now.I gave it to a friend and he too would n't buy it for dirt cheap . It 's pretty heavy and bulky on the sides too . I know this item is long discontinued but look FAR away from it .	1
I love it , I bought it at an AT & T store when it first came out for almost $ 140.00 , so you can see that its a great price here . It pairs easily and has excellent sound quality ( and I 'm extremely picky when it comes to quality sound ) . I want to buy an extra set in case anything ever happens to these . They charge fast and work great . Only problem I ever have is without a case , you can accidently turn them on way to easy and when you need them , the battery is dead . The on button is on the right ear and pushes very easy to turn on the unit expecially when you handle them to just move them . You have to always be sure that the light is not blinking or you 'll drain the battery , whose charging connector comes with a standard small USB connector found on most phones and headsets today . It comes with a charger and a black protective cover that a bit too small , so fighting to get it in the bag can cause you to accidently turn it on .	1
This is the best headset I have every had . The comfort is great and so is the clarity . The fact that it comes with so much makes it unlike any other . You normally have to purchase all the accessories but they all came with it . In my opinion , it 's your best buy .	1
This headset is exactly as described by the manufacturer . The sound is great . The fit is very comfortable ; I have had it on for 2-3 hours without even realizing it 's on.You ca n't go wrong with this .	1
I am having both the Jabra BT500 and BT135 . Very satisfy with their voice quality . However , what I brought for my girl friend is the BlueAnt X3 . Its cute design caught my attention . My girl friend loves it so much that she never answer her phone without it . She said it 's easy to set on her ear and very comfortable . We both satisfy with its voice quality as well . I 'll highly recommend to anyone who is looking for one .	1
I love that I can use this wirelessly . It 's just that sometimes it drops out when I sit my MP3 down and I do n't like that . I usually ending up having to reconnect it to the headphones , but it does n't happen that often . Otherwise , I would give it 5 stars .	1
I got this to use my 5g iPod with my BT-3030 BT adapter.I got this over the 125s because I can potentially use this with anything that has a 3.5mm jack . And the 125s looked a bit fragile.At least with my BT-3030 it works very well . It does n't have a lot of range ( 40 feet at most line of sight ) but that 's not my concern.Only downsides are no user replaceable battery and it only charges with USB . It 'd be nice if it doubled as a USB to BT dongle for the PC , but oh well.It 's a lot smaller than I thought it 'd be . So small in fact that Jabra should consider making an iPod sleeve with a a120s pocket attached . ( are you listening Jabra ? ) The other minor issue is that when it 's fully charged , the power button/indicator LED changes green , but not always . Sometimes it 'll go green after an hour sometimes after 10.I 'd recommend this to anyone wanting to use a simple universal BT transmitter .	1
I use this transmitter on the back of my tv with my Bluetooth headphones . It works perfectly for my purpose and the battery lasts pretty long , given the size of this thing . It 's really small , smaller than a matchbox even . Charges up in about 2 hours and will go for a couple weeks , with an hour or two of use per day . I did have some problems trying to get this thing to pair , it 's looks as if there are no buttons , do n't worry , it 's there . The light is also the button , on the opposite side of the USB charging port , and the audio cable . Once you play with this thing for a little while will make you a pro at it . Then you 'll have no problems . I definitely recommend this little transmitter .	1
This device is pretty simple , plug it in , hold the button to pair and thats pretty much it . It works fine with theJabra BT620s Headphonesand does its job well , but my only complaint is that it seems to suffer from some interference every now and then that some of my other Bluetooth devices don't.Please note well that this is just a minor quibble , and the overall performance is superb . The device comes with a USB-A to USB-Mini-B cable ( pretty standard ) and will charge via any USB port . I get between 8-12 hours of use per charge.Note : This will only work with headsets that support the A2DP profile . It does not have a regular Mono headset profile .	1
This little bluetooth transmitter is the berries . It works with many products to send your music via Bluetooth . It just works and seems to have great battery life to boot . Drawback is there are no user replaceable batteries . But since it is new things are golden . Very please with this product .	1
Connects my tv and mp3 player -- perfectly with my Motorola S9 stereo bluetooth headphones .	1
Pairs easily with my Sony headphones , sounds great , half the price of Sony 's transmitter -- what more do I need to say ?	1
This could not be much easier to use , it syncs with Moto S9 headphones quickly , and the charge ( battery ) lasts a long time . It is a very small , very light-weight box that can just dangle from an mp3 player ( iPod ) or be held on with a rubber band .	1
This item links up easily . Dont make the mistake I did of trying to pair it each time ... you dont have to once you have paired it once . this transmits a true 30 feet . I 'm driving to key west next week and will know how long a charge lasts after that . Nice to finally be able to use my wireless bluetooth stereo headset on any of my sound players..Update : This stopped working after a year ... the on/off button is unresponsive now . It was great while it lasted ! ! !	1
connects to my motorola s705 , and lets me hear my xm and other music and gps in great sterio quality	1
Is n't perfect -- some comments get cut off and there 's a little noise , but for the most part is quite good . People generally do n't realize they are on speakerphone , and it 's much better than fumbling with a headset . The only problem is that my Treo 750 turns off the bluetooth when the battery gets low , so I have to make sure to turn it back on , but that 's Treo 's problem .	1
I have used this speakerphone for about a year now and it is great . Everyone in the car can talk on it including the kids in the back seat . Great loud , clear volume . The battery lasts for weeks . Easy to set up and use . Just remember to charge it every two or three months .	1
I tried five wireless Blue Tooth headsets ( Plantronic , Logitech , Samsung , Jabra , etc ) and none worked very well -- with one issue or another . Some sounded tinney , and all carried lots of road noise . So the people on the other end always complained.In stepped in the BlueAnt Bluetooth which I read about as Gadget of the Week in Barons . The device works very well . I simply leave it on the magnetic holder provided which rests on the Visor . I can hear the caller very clearly . The device is especially good at boosting the volume level . So I can turn the volume up and hear even the softest voices while traveling on the highway . On the other side of the call , the callers tell me that the voice quality is pretty good , with a hint of echo sometimes . Most important , they do n't complain about road noise.I leave the device in the car all the time , and recharge it about once a week . The on-off switch is great . You flip the microphone down toward you and it is ON . You flip it back flat into the device , and it is off . So there 's never a mystery about whether it is ON or OFF.I highly recommend this device for anyone who uses the cell phone while driving . Keep in mind that this device is essentially a speakerphone in the car . So everyone in the car will be able to hear the conversation , and everyone in the car is able to speak to the person on the other end of the call . So anyone who rideshares to commute may have issues with this feature .	1
I just purchased this device , and use it with a Motorola V365 cell phone ( AT & T ) . Although the quality of the sound may not equal that of your land line phone , or maybe even your cell phone under ideal conditions , it is excellent . The people with whom I have spoken say that I sound fine , and I am pleased with how they sound . There is absolutely no issue with the volume . Based on my experience , I am comfortable saying that for the price , you will be very happy with the Blue Ant .	1
All I could say is WOW , this little thing is soooo cool . After receiving my Supertooth II , I removed it from the box , charged it up , paired it to my Motorola V3M ( U.S. Cellular ) and I was up and running in 1 minute . Believe me when I tell you that I tried nearly all the bluetooth headsets out there , they were either falling off my ear , not loud enough or just yuppy junk . THIS SUPERTOOTH II SOLVED MY PROBLEM . It 's so cool , after an hour I ran back to my computer and ordered another unit for my wife . Being a police officer for 25+ years I have noticed an increase in traffic crashes due to distractions within the at fault vehicle . From what I see , cell phone use while driving is becoming a serious problem , I wish I could afford to buy every driver one of these . If your looking for the near perfect bluetooth speaker ( nothings perfect ) , this is the one . If you buy it through Amazon and for some strange reason you do n't like it , Amazon has a super return policy . Buy one and drive safe ... ... .	1
Very convenient product to have that allows for easy movement from one vehicle to the next . The speaker quality is good and the ability to shift the microphone to a different angle is a nice touch . I gave it 4 stars because it does n't consistently automatically connect to the LG enV phone after pairing the two devices together . Sometimes if I try to make a call via voice dial , it wo n't activate the phones voice dial feature like it should when I press the Answer/End button . Overall the product is a good product , but LG enV buyers beware of the inconsistencies .	1
The BlueAnt worked just as advertised . My wife and I both have them in our cars and have no problems . Easy to use and good quality sound .	1
I bought this for my wife . she says it 's best thing I 've ever bought for her ( so she must like it ) . I also bought one for my daughter who says she loves it but would like to see a future model with and LCD or LED readout of the number she 's calling or talking to . otherwise , it 's an excellent product and priced right	1
The voice quality of Blueant Supertooth II is better than my factory installed Cadillac Bluetooth phone . Amazingly powerful speakerphone in such a small package . The listeners at the other end , who used to complain of muffled voice from my built in Cadillac Bluetooth phone , can now hear clearly and sometime have hard time believing that I am calling from handsfree phone . It sticks very securely to the magnetic attachment for the visor . Construction is a little bit like cheap Chinese products Because the metal cover for my on/off switch fell off on the first day . But overall it is a good product and you will be pleased at its performance.Update 4/29/2008 : The speaker stopped working after a week . BlueAnt said the product is discontinued and they will replace with Supertooth Light	1
This is the case my wife uses in her purse since she wants to be able to slide it in and out . I personally prefer there to be a top cover , but this works great for her needs .	1
The headset carrier is great in the car . I have it clipped to the visor . It keeps my headset in easy reach and not sliding all over the truck . I 've used this carrier for two different Plantronics headsets , the old Voyager 510 and my new Voyager HD . It fits both great . I 'd recommend this carrier to anyone who wants to keep track of their Plantronics Bluetooth .	1
This is a great toy , I love how it fits my earpiece and attaches securly to my purse . I do n't have to worry about buttons being pushed while it is in my purse . I love the ability to keep my ear piece safe .	1
Where to begin ? ? Well , I ran out and bought a 4GB MS Pro Duo the first day I got it ( 1 week ago ) . Now I have : 200+ songs with very nice audio ( even the speakerphone ) , good quality snapshot pics ( daytime ) , Full web browser ( Opera Mini ) , RSS Reader , eMSN Messenger , email , 40+ games , Google maps ( for directions ) , currency converter , all the stuff that the phone came with originally and I still have a little less than 3 GB left ( videos coming soon ) . Oh , and it 's a phone too . A very good one at that . No dropped calls so far ( 005 update with Cingular service- Miami ) and good battery life , especially when you consider that I have been using it quite heavily for the past week . Feels solid too . Everything else has already been said.Gripes- The volume in the earpiece is a tad low ( but much better than my old Moto V551 ) , and I have n't figured out how to hear my ringtone while I have the earbuds on ( while I listen to music , the music simply stops when I get a call ) . And about the earbuds- I like them a lot . Yes , it does kind of suck that you have to use the adapter ( especially when you want to charge at the same time ) , but I do n't see why they would not be portable since the buds and adapter are about the same length and size as a normal pair of earbuds.Overall , best phone I have ever owned .	1
I bought this phone after making a horrible purchase at Cingular with their LG320 . Terrible phone.I bought the W810 so that I could play music at the gym after my wife started using my Ipod . And this phone worked out perfectly . After sticking 2GB of memory stick pro duo in to the phone , I was up and running in no time flat . The phone has really easy to use controls and the music quality was pretty good.The software that Sony gives you is also easy to use and easy to setup . I was easily able to transfer music and files back and forth to the phone . I loved being able to go out to Sony 's website and download new themes for the phone as well.I 'm sad to say that I had to sell my W810 . I found that travel was too difficult without staying in touch with email . So I 've moved over to a Blackjack . However , I am so sad to not have my little phone around . I really got attached to it . It was an awesome little phone and would HIGHLY recmmend it .	1
My previous phone was a Nokia 6600 . It had a slow interface for 2006 and come on , I wanted to try somethingn new.Initially , I had planned on exploring my chances of buying a Treo but due to the rates , I gave up my plan . Without much pondering , I went and purchased a Sony Ericsson W810i . Now , it 's been four weeks . Let me just give you a brief run thru of features , pros and cons.Features1 . This phone is an mp3 player . This phone is a torch/semi flash light ( with an SOS signal that can be configured ) . This phone has flash capability and further doubles up into a digital camera . Overall , it saves a lot of space to use this phone instead of just going out with a standalone mp3 player or/and a digital camera2 . The interface is fast . It takes around 8 seconds to get an auto focus and click a picture using the camera . I 'll try and explain - to come out of the screensaver you need half a second , to activate camera using the shortcut it takes 3 seconds , a further 2 seconds for auto focus and an additional 1 second to click you picture . Overall,8 seconds to click one image.You can browse thru pictures very quickly . It 's around 7 times faster than my Nokia . Images can be clicked in sepia , black and white , solarise ( kinda yellowey ) , negative and normal modes . Brightness can be reduced within the click of a button . I noticed grains on images of larger size . I do n't recommend using the flash camera unless you really must . Plus while clicking a video , the light goes on and off , if the flash light is turned on.3 . The build quality on the phone is both good and bad . I love the keypad and it is a major improvement from the 800i and sundry walkman phones . It took me three days to get used to the keypad . The dictionary like function on the phone keeps a track of all the words you spell . So they 're definitely there the next time around . The front of the phone seems to appear too plastic . Especially the silver scroll keys and sometimes can make your phone look like a dummy piece . The sound speakers are situated on the backside of the phone and can be used conveniently even when the phone is upside down . You can insert your memory stick pro cards even when the phone is switched on . There is NO CAMERA SHUTTER like the previous installment of this phone ( 800i ) The power button is placed most effectively just like the volume buttons on the right side of the phone which can be used for a host number of features.4 . The internal memory of this phone is 22mb and the accompanied card contains 512mb worth of memory . The usable memory , however , is only 431mb . Upon connecting to the pc , both are instantly recognized and act as removable drives on the `` my computer '' icon . The accompanied software is almost brilliant . I loved `` Disc2phone '' and there is so much more I keep discovering about the other programs . Despite lacking an English Manual , I found I didnt need one because I do n't know too many people who would buy a sony ericsson phone and not be techies in their own rights who like to configure things on their own.5 . The bundled earphones are sublime . I can not beleive the sound on these . They cancel all the noises in a room and it 's a pleasure listening to beethoven playing away or Enya 's mesmerising voice or even Tool 's prog metal for that matter . The speakers are satisfactory and could have been louder . If used as a stand alone mp3 player with earphones , the phone would stand for around 6-7 hours.Playing the music without using earphones can eat up battery depending on the volumes of course . It supports m4a , mp3 and aac formats ( and a few other formats ) 6 . The messages memory of the phone is limited to around 150+ messages and that is a big blunder . Despite having a 512mb of external storage the phone can not accommodate a mere 200 messages . The size of notes is limited and you need to make a second note to carry on . Bluetooth transfers to Samsung , Nokia phones runs at 20kbps while it 's a consistent 40kbps for Sony Ericsson phones . Very good for transferring media.Pros- It can be called an ipod replacement . I do n't use mine quarter as much as I used to . This is owing to the absolutely brilliant earphones that sit within your ear and help you celebrate your time.- I love how the phone slides into a digital camera . Good build quality for the particular feature.- Good standby , saves battery , easy to work with 50 % brightness . Even when I reduce brightness from 100 % to 50 % ( lowest possible ) there is hardly any noticeable difference on the screen . The keypad is much lighter but that 's hardly noticeable.- Fast processor , super graphics and wallpaper options , includes a good browser , calendar , good default themes- The accompanied torch can be used to change a flat tire and can be switched on for 25mins even when the remaining battery is only 15 % . ( tried and tested ) - Good keypad ( KEY FEATURE ) , good playlist configuring options- Excellent software for the phone , mp3s can transferred at variable bit-rates without taking too long- Excellent , fast log , the phones keeps track off the last ten numbers you 've messaged and keeps them around for easy usage- It 's easy to store numbers cause the phone prompts to save numbers when a call from an unknown number ends- Great handsfree- There is a memory stick converter ( The longer ones used in cameras ) and that is a handy thing- The MACRO mode helps in copying handwritten/type written documents using the cameraCons- too plastic , looks a bit boring too soon , screen can be scratched if no touchscreen is present- the accompanied tones for messages is sad , the message memory is very limite ( Big DEMERIT ) and the size of a note is limited- Call quality is not as good as can be- sometimes it takes over a minute for the phone to recognize it has been plugged into a USB slot- the accompanied FM radio needs to be in place to avoid screechiness in sound and proper volume- Even though the phone provides 512mb worth of external memory , only 431mb is useable . Ideally , i 'd have liked a one gig card so I could have doubled on my usage.- Not enough upgradations over the W800i . People can settle for that phone because it has a slightly better talk life- IT HAS NO ENGLISH MANUAL- noticeable grains on 2megapixel imagesConclusion , All though I am very happy with this phone , I cant help but throw a fit over the limited message storage , you can save messages onto your pc but come on , who 's gon na do that ? Buy this phone if you like what you read . Not enough reasons to upgrade for 800i owners . BUT this phone has more appeal than 800i and has better more smooth graphics . There is a much better display and there is an improvement of 25 % which I just noticed.However , unlike the 550i , there are no three way speakers and that makes `` Stereo Widening '' impossible.Overall rating - 7/10Very little to complain about , reallyGood luck , fellow techies	1
I 've owned this phone for 18 months , the first 15 months with T-Mobile and the past 3 months with AT & T . ; Reception has been great with AT & T . ; With T-Mobile , reception was good . For data , I use the Operamini 4 web browser with AT & T ; 's unlimited Medianet and it is extremely fast and reliable . I can access almost all web sites . With T-Mobile Web , service was mediocre , up and down . But that was not the fault of the phone , but the provider . This phone has it all except for 3G and support for Bluetooth Stereo headsets . Music quality is great if you do not mind using the included wired headset.The camera is ok and takes decent pictures . But I would not buy this phone for the camera . The phone is very simple and intuitive to use . You can go on Sony Ericsson 's web site and get whatever settings you need to suit the services you want your carrier to perform . I was only interested in the wap settings to surf the internet and SE sent that to my phone via SMS in a few seconds.If you want a reliable phone for data and voice , you should consider this phone . Battery life is excellent . I charge it almost every night for 2 hours because I leave the Operamini 4 browser on almost always since I am a very heavy data user .	1
Screen is absolutely beautiful , charging either by car jack or wall takes only minutes to get a full charge that lasts days . Quickdial , camera , online button , voicedialing all great . Antenna is excellent , but not perfect . Walkman is good , but could use a little more human factors work . Small as it is , the speaker and microphone is phenomenal and cuts through noise very well . Adding google maps and Yahoo ! mail to the phone and it 's a multimedia powerhouse that plays music and keeps you up to date . Excellent bang for the buck .	1
I purchased the phone in white and flashed using davinciteam to Hong Kong versionthe screen is pretty bright , but it has a major problem : you ca n't view it without backlight , that you ca n't see the clock when the phone is idle ( like old T610/T616 . the standby gif has pretty fast motion , most of the themes for 176x220 SE models will work , except some themes for Z710i , shows file corrupt errorreception is good , it 's like Z710isome complains about the earpiece volume problem , but I do n't have such , loud enough even on the 7 bars , speakerphone is louder than Z710ithe keypad is TOO SMALL , it 's small like SDA/SP5m , it may bring hard time for big thumb , and it 's easy to press Return and Clear buttons by accidentthe audio player is easy and clear to control , though it do n't support ogg vorbis , you can encode mp3 in VBR mode to get enhanced audio qualitythe fonts is kinda small , unlike Z710i , which has updated OS , the clock font size can not be changedbt support is regular SE style ( with a lot of profiles ) , but Z710i also has wireless headphones and bt network serverthe cam is good for 2mpx , it has auto-focus and macro mode , that I can take pic in near distance , but the pic has some noticeable color pixels on white background , it has LED light , which also can be used as flashlight , that is handy in the darkinternet is fine , tethering through either bt or USB works well with pda and laptop , the browser is good toothough it does n't support bt wireless headphones , the included headset has 3.5mm jack on the mic unit , that you can use your favorite headphones/earphones with the phonebattery time is good for regular use , if you leave the phone idle all the time , the battery can last at least 3 days , or continuous 3.5 hours modem usepros : good audio player , supports PSP cardFM radio has good reception , and supports RDSgood phone receptionfull functional btgood cam with auto-focuslong battery timecons : LCD is dark when idle , unable to show clocksmall keypads , that brings problem with big thumbcam does not have protective cover , like W800 and K790no dedicated T-Zones ( internet ) button , and unable to assign one ( you can assign web button , that opens SonyEricsson offline home page , not online portal ) streaming audio is limited to 3gp , no local ogg vorbis supportconclusion : 91/100 , if you can live with small buttons , you should be fine	1
Have no probs with this cahrger till date but the phone screen went blank and dont know why . I ca n't see who calls neither can I dial cos its a touch screen . had to ger a blackberry fone .	1
Thought I was going to get a cheap replacement ( not the one pictured ) . This was the same nokia charger ( ac-4u ) that came with my n800 . The only difference is that it did not come with the velcro strap .	1
Purchased this charger to replace a broken e71 charger . Works correctly . Unbeatable price . Nokia AC-4U is the charger model number . I would pay twice as much for it . Great stuff .	1
I like this original nokia charger..Very cheap but shipping is more expensive than the original price .	1
I have had the Q for about 3 weeks now and have played with it , installed apps on it , modified the home screen , read tons of reviews and forums on it and bought a screen protector for it.All in all , its a great smart phone with a few improvements to be made on it.- the media player is choppy at times and I will have to assume that this is a bug.- the system itself is a little slower than I would like but bearable.- the plastic casing just plain SUCKS . I will assume that plastic was chosen to ensure the light weight , however , I think aluminum is the way to go and is much more sturdy . For example the RAZR.- battery life is something of a challenge . even the extended battery will only give you about 12-14 hours with moderate use.Other than what I listed above , the phone is great and I am still fairly happy with the phone.TIP - Try to find any defects with your phone within the first 15 days . After that , VZW will give you a refurbished phone if you bring it in after 15 days .	1
I have read a lot of the reviews and spoken to a number of current owners of the Motorola Q. I have also owned and used Blackberries , Treo 's , LG Phones including the LG VX9800 and the Motorola Razor . I picked one up this week and here are my initial impressions.The phone layout and design are excellent . Compared to other devices like the Blackberry and Treo , the keys are in a much better location ( about up from the bottom end of the phone ) making it much less stressful on the thumbs to type . The keys functions are very similar to a Blackberry . Takes a little bit of getting use to but learn very quickly.Active Sync , which it comes with , is a breeze to set-up and start syncing . Works great with Outlook . I also have set-up my device to pull down emails from my gmail account . I read one review that said everything was being doubled when transferring . No so here . Works like a charm and very fast . Internet connections are much faster that on my Blackberry , which my work has supplied me.The battery is another item that people tend to give bad reviews on . That may be why Verizon is currently offering a 60 dollar battery for 19 dollars . Supposedly the extended battery will give double the time which as I understand it from other users is about 2 days.One of the big issues that people are focusing on in these reviews is the processing speed and how it is affected by having multiple applications open and the hassle of closing them once you are done with them . First , the Motorola is like any computer ... .having multiple applications open and running all at once will kill the processing speed of computer . Second , to close the programs is much easier than represented in these reviews . Just go to your home page and click on the top smart icons Task Manager and `` Kill All '' tasks running.So far very happy with my decision.Update : 6/12/06After a week of using my Q , I am still pleased with my decision . I continue to monitor the other reviews and what I find interesting is the fact that many people focus on items that are very nit picky , i.e . the screen is slightly off center . Interesting ... I did n't even notice until that person pointed it out . What is also interesting is that people tend to want a device that does everything exceptionally well ( pda , phone , etc ) . I would agree that that would be the ideal but I am happy with a device that does everything good . Each person has their own preferences and what you really need to keep in mind is what you need the device to do . I just need a device that syncs with my home computer ( outlook ) , can send text and picture messages , syncs with my email via the web and provides me occasional access to the internet . The Q does all that and more.Update 6/16/06Ok . I have returned my phone ( s ) yes , plural ! ! Let me explain why.The first phone had an issue with it 's bluetooth functionality/transmitter . I returned it and exchanged for another Motorola Q.My second phone I had for one day before it completely died and nothing I or tech support could do would allow it to be restarted.Motorola has some serious issues to overcome with their Quality Assurance program.When I was on the phone with Verizon Tech Support I asked them which device/Smartphone they recieved the least number of calls on ... they said the Treo 700w . As such , I return my Motorola Q and purchased the 700w . Wow , what a difference ! The Treo is much faster and much easier to use . I would downgrade my rating but unfortunately once the stars are choosen in Amazon 's rating system they can not be changed .	1
Having previously owned the LG VX9800 ( one of the best phones EVER made ) for nearly a year , I was hesitant at first to switch over to a PDA/Smartphone format ... but I 'm glad I finally did . The Motorola Q is a must-have for anyone who needs both Internet access and PDA productivity features wherever they go . Most PDA phones are bulky and quite clumsy for the task of conversing without the aid of a headset . This phone , however , is short and slim enough to make that problem negligible . It fits in an ordinary shirt or pants pocket with plenty of room to spare . The speakerphone is of good quality , so if you do n't have a headset and do n't like pressing a PDA to your face , phone conversations still come through very clear . Windows Mobile 5.0 has many useful features , but accessing them can be somewhat tedious work at times . The keys are very tiny and I was disappointed that the Q does n't have dedicated number keys , unlike the VX9800 . Also , the plastic cover on the mini-SD slot is hard to remove and practically requires a pair of small tweezers just to open . Those are my main gripes about the phone , but overall the positives outnumber the negatives . The camera takes decent pictures and the side scroll wheel comes in very handy for navigating around the screen . Speaking of the screen , its very bright and crisp ... though using it in direct sunlight may prove a little challenging . As I stated at the beginning , the Internet features are oustanding . I have Verizon 's unlimited data plan and despite the fact EVDO is not yet available where I live , I can still stream radio stations flawlessly over the built-in Windows Media Player . In fact , the Q multi-tasks like a champion : One time I was listening to a streaming audio feed , surfing the Internet , and sending a text message all at the same time without a trace of hesitation from the CPU . Non-Internet applications like Pocket Streets and Trips also run smoothly . With a gadget like the Q , laptops are suddenly looking more and more like desktops .	1
I 've been using it for about a month . Got it on amazon , the prices simply can not be beat . This phone is $ 170 in cingular stores ! I like it so far and if I could give it 4.5 stars , I would . Here 're my impressions:1. it 's tiny . Normally , I like small but the dial pad is so small that I can barely press the keys and I 've small fingers ! If you have large hands or long fingernails you simply wo n't be able to use this phone.2 . the sound quality is not so great . It 's not loud enough , even on the loudest setting.3 . the firmware has a few non-intuitive things . For example , when you press & hold a button for fast dial , it 'll beep & say , `` no number associated with this speed dial . '' but it wo n't say how to associate it . nor will it take you to the phone book . It 's probably in the manual but in this day & age I should n't have to read the manual to figure out how to use my phone.4 . There are no games that come with it . You get 2 demos of crappy games that let you play for 5 mins only . Terrible.5 . Bluetooth works great . Paired it with my car 's handsfree link w/o problems.6 . You ca n't reprogram the center button , always takes you to Cingular 's website which costs you $ $ $ . Bad idea . You can , however , reprogram the joystick.Overwall , I 'm happy with the phone and it 's very stylish & sexy looking . I would recommend it to friends but watch out for things above .	1
Nice slider phone , wanted a change from the bricks and flip phones . Bluetooth is great , and the Samsung PC Suite ( free download from Samsung ) lets you edit your contacts , upload ringtones , and just about anything else you want to do . Battery life is great , about one week between charges . The speaker is not the greatest quality , so a headset is recommended . Cingular did not bundle a headset , so that 's extra . Interface is intuitive and functions are easy to figure out . Speakerphone sound quality is only marginal.The main selling point of the phone is its sliding and its thinness . Other than that , it 's basically like all other GSM phones . There are cheaper flip phones that can also do video.I would have given this phone five stars if the sound quality was better .	1
Samsung has made a very attractive and slim slider phone with an incredibly vivid color LCD . This is probably one of the best slider phones on the market . The only complaint that I have is the keys on the main outer display are too flush and if you have larger fingers , then you will probably constantly hit the wrong buttons . Sound quality is excellent and will also depend on carrier reception . Speakerphone is very good and can be utilized with or without phone being opened . Overall , an excellent entry into the slider phone market by Samsung in a compact package .	1
This phone does every thing I could want from a phone . It EVEN makes calls ; - ) The camera takes a very nice picture and video , and the large display shows it very clearly . You can make your own ring tones from MP3s , though limited in size , its enough for a good long ring . ( it would go to voice mail before the song would repeat . ) The MP3 player is cheesy , but it plays them just fine ( no higher than 192 bit rate ) Once I added a 1 gig MicroSD , I was able to convert my music videos and even some full length DivX 'd movies to the phone . ( Use SUPER , It is a must for awesome FREE video and audio conversion ( Not a plug , just the truth ) ) The blue tooth works great , and combined with the free Samsung edit software , you have full control over phone content from your PC . The design is very sleek , and fits into a pocket with ease . I could go on and on.. I liked it so much I got a second one for the wife.The But ... .The ear piece volume is very low . The max setting is 5 . It really needs to go to 10 . The only other `` whine '' I 'd have is if your not careful while sliding it open to take a call , you can easily tap the 'end call ' button and send it strait to voice mail.The PROs really out weigh the CONs by far , I 'd get more of these at the under 80 USD price should I need them : )	1
So I 'm pseudo-techno-geek . I love the tech , but ultimately give into the practicality . That said , I needed a new phone for work and the geek in me immediately was drawn to a myriad of phones that had good gadgets ( mp3 , camera/video playback , bluetooth , etc.. ) . The more I looked , the more I had to prioritize my needs . I wanted a phone that had good clear connections and had MAN-BUTTONS ! Pros : -Good sized , easy to use buttons-Average call quality-Average menu setup-Includes 1.3 mp cam/video-Ability to onboard video to the camera ... but if this is important , go with a 240x320 display phone ( like the Cingular 2125 ) . Res is too low on this phone to be pleasing to the eye.-Limited Bluetooth ( ca n't move files ) -Can play music-External speakersCons-Need to do 'special code ' to activate use of MP3's.-Poor music file management and access.-Ca n't use speaker phone while it 's flipped close ... ever.-Video quality is poor.-Limited Bluetooth ( ca n't move files ) Over all I 'm very happy with Amazon 's excellent pricing and service in getting this phone to me . Verizon 's service so far has been solid . The phone is just about everything I expected , but I 'll probably upgrade in a year something jazzier. [ ... ]	1
After getting myself a new VX8700 , I picked up a new VX8300 for my girlfriend . The VX8300 is not the prettiest or thinest phone Verizon offers , but it seems to be one of their best performers . Sound quality , speakerphone , RF , and battery life all seem very good . The camera takes decent pictures . It has just about all the features you expect in a phone today too . With a new contract , you can get it for $ 50 or less . At this price , I give it 5 stars .	1
The LG VX8300 is the latest offering in the market for do- ( almost ) -it-all cell phones . It combines all of the standard phone functionality with music and video playback and phone , making it a media powerhouse considering that it 's such a portable , affordable package . The next step up would be a smartphone , but at significant extra cost for the addition of more well-rounded PDA functions.THE PHONEThe first thing you 'll notice about the 8300 is that it 's a great-looking piece of tech - stylish and modern yet also subdued enough that it wo n't embarrass you in business settings . Some pictures make it look black , but it is actually a deep metallic pewter color . It 's roughly the same size ( 3.5 x 1.9 x 0.9 ) as LG 's other recent clamshell phones , although a little slimmer for easier pocketing . It feels solid but not heavy at 3.9 oz with the standard battery . The plastic case feels softer than prior models , so it may be more susceptible to scratches and scrapes over time . There is a leather case for it , but I doubt you could bear the idea of covering up this good-looking unit.The 8300 runs on Verizon 's CDMA all-digital network , so coverage may be an issue if you live in rural areas . I 've been a Verizon customer for years with LG digitals and never run into any dead spots around town and while traveling , but check Verizon 's coverage maps on their website beforehand.Voice clarity is superb , both for you and for the person you 're calling . The 8300 has speakerphone capability , but amplified through the external audio speakers , it tends to be so loud that it may distort - set your volume appropriately low.The phone has a wide array of conveniences , including numerous handy voice-activated commands ( send messages , check voice mail , look up contact , examine wireless account , etc . ) , one-touch calling , unique rings and photo IDs for different contacts , an address book with room for 500 contacts , and so on . I 'm a huge proponent of the voice-activated commands , and while the 8300 is very easy to set up , the long-term downside is that instead of matching up your command with your own prerecorded voice as prior models did , this phone tries to actually phonetically `` read '' entries from your contacts list and find a match that way . So , if you have unusually-spelled names with silent letters in your contacts list , the 8300 will have a tough time making a match . Plus , when it repeats the name back to you , it generally mangles the pronunciation , making that form of caller ID undesirable . It 's too bad that the contacts list does n't have a separate `` nickname '' field so that you could accurately store the contact as say , `` Mike Krzyzewski '' but have the voice-activated commands look the entry up as `` Coach '' , for example.If you 're obsessive about ringtones , then you 'll be disappointed with the default offerings . They play back with great quality , but they 're pretty boring . Verizon clearly wants you to go to their GetItNow service to purchase the latest and flashiest ringtones . It 's not documented in the manual , but it is possible to use MP3s loaded into the phone as ringtones.The phone supports Bluetooth v.1.1 , which makes it easily compatible with many wireless devices like headsets/earpieces . You can also use this to wirelessly transmit and receive contact information with other Bluetooth devices.THE CAMERAI bought my first digital camera about five years ago - a 1.3 megapixel Olympus for about $ 350 . Now , for a fraction of the price and space , the 8300 delivers that same picture quality . It 's also got additional features that make the results actually worth viewing/printing , including flash , white balancing for a variety of lighting conditions ( no more washed out or oddly-tinted phone pics ) , a four-position digital zoom , and night mode . There are also some capabilities for having fun with your photos such as special effects ( negative , posterize , etc . ) , self-portrait capability using the external screen as a viewfinder , and a timer . You can take pictures from 160x120 thumbnails all the way up to print-quality 1280x960.The camera can also take videos , although the quality is predictably choppy and the largest clip that can be sent via email is only 15 seconds . Like any of the phone 's media , larger clips can be stored to the phone 's internal memory or onto an optional microSD card and then copied to another device or PC.Photos taken can be used as contact IDs or wallpaper on either the external or main screen . Both screens are breathtaking in their brightness , clarity and resolution . They never fail to register the initial jaw-dropping compliment when someone sees the phone for the first time.MUSIC PLAYERYou ca n't really say MP3 player because the 8300 wants to only play files in Microsoft 's .wma format . This is because Verizon wants you to use their VCast online music store . I purchased the Music Essential Pack with my phone and was sorely disappointed in this - the VCast software would n't load ( it kept trying to roll me back to Windows Media Player 10 even though I 'm on 11 ) , the USB cable kept losing connection ( crummy driver software ) , and the headphones were just so-so . I recommend instead investing in a big MicroSD card and using it to store and transfer all of your music , photos and videos . This is clearly the easiest way to load information back and forth between the phone , although Verizon wo n't tell you that since it cuts their overpriced music store out of the loop . And if you do prefer MP3s for playback , the 8300 may not be configured out of the box to play them , but it 's a simple change to make - just search the web for instructions.The sound for playback is very good , again considering that it 's not a dedicated music device . The external stereo speakers are on either side of the clamshell hinge and they pump out a lot of sound for their size . The 8300 has a very good ergonomic feature in the form of player control buttons ( play/pause , fast forward , rewind ) on the outside face of the phone . So , you can keep it in the palm of your hand rather than flipped open while listening.BUSINESS/PRODUCTIVITYThe 8300 comes with the standard roster of business apps dumbed down for cell phone usage : calendar , world clock , calculator with tip macros , etc . At this time , I have n't found an easy way to sync data back and forth with any desktop apps like Outlook or Notes . There are open source apps on the Web like Bitpim that can do this , but the 8300 is currently too new for that software to handle . That gap should be remedied soon.Verizon offers wireless broadband via an EV-DO network that includes most major metropolitan areas and airports.One exceptional add-on that Verizon offers is VZ Navigator , which turns the 8300 into a GPS-driven navigation device . You can purchase the add-on either monthly if you do a lot of traveling by car or even day-to-day if you 're just taking a short trip . It works well , looks great , and really boosts the usefulness of this unit.CONCLUSIONThe LG VX8300 combines a great phone , a camera that 's actually useful and some pretty cool media capabilities into one compact unit . There are of course some trade-offs for each , but the convenience of only having to carry one slim item in your pocket is invaluable . It really is a marvel for the price.PROS* A very clear phone with many convenient features like voice-activated commands . * A 1.3 megapixel camera capable of taking pictures you 'd actually have printed thanks to 1280x960 resolution , flash , and color effects . * A good-sounding music player that , when combined with your own library on an optional microSD card , puts hours of entertainment in your pocket . * Bluetooth capability for wireless add-ons and communication with other devices.CONS* Incompatible with existing accessories - get ready to buy new chargers , sync cables , etc . * VCast music store is overpriced and not easy to set up ( just get a microSD card and use it to store/transfer media instead - no problem ) . * Initial selection of ringtones is pretty dull - another attempt by Verizon to squeeze extra charges out of you . * Some of the external buttons are awkwardly sized and/or placed - people with larger hands may cramp up after prolonged periods of use .	1
Feb. 6 , 2012 : I ca n't believe I 've had this phone 5 years , but I have , and it still works and , more amazingly , it6 's still working on the original battery - not that I can guarantee that you 'll have the same results.I said originally that I use it to make calls , and that 's what I do today . Only today , it 's hooked up to my Bluetooth in the car , and it stays in its little cubbyhole and does n't see the light of day except for its weekly charge . It 's really too much trouble to take it off Bluetooth , so we do all our calling from the car , and even that 's not much . Our kids all all back in this state and within an hour of us , and chatting does n't seem to be anyone 's style nowadays . It 's not a smart phone , but we 're smart people : we now prepay for a year and , although we ended up with 120 hours per phone ( my wife has the same one ) , we 're also running $ 500 less than when we paid monthly . And Verizon has even gotten better . I have n't found a dead spot in this mountainous area except for Sequoia National Park where I did n't want to talk to anyone anyway.Still think it 's a great phone , And if you absolutely MUST , you can get on the internet and you can take a snapshot . Unfortunately , that will cost you extra . ****I have owned cell phones since the time of `` the Brick , '' and 10 models in between . Now that coverage is excellent in most of the country ( mountains are still a problem in this neck of the woods ) , if you want a phone to make phone calls , this is probably a little better than most . It is certainly more durable than the Razr.The pluses : Good reception for the most part ; great speaker phone ( better than my wired office phones ) ; good display.The minuses : The handbook that comes with it is 37 pages long . Anything after page 4 costs money . Send out five high res pictures , and you run into real money . And it may be an MP3 player of sorts , but at $ 2 a song , I 'll stick with my iRiver or iPod.The long and short of it . After looking for a year for a phone that just made phone calls , this is what we chose . I do n't need the camera , but now you have no choice . With special incentives from Verizon - probably because we 've been with them for 3 years - the total cost was the retail tax for two phones . Everything else was a mail in or instant rebate.Four stars because it 's a fairly good phone , and I 've given up on persuading anyone under 50 that they still need a wired phone especially when you want to talk to more than one person at a time . Yeah , the speaker phone is great , but so sensitive that it 'll pick up ambient noise so that I can hear people who are 15 feet away from it .	1
used phone for one bill cycle and works just fine activation was quick and easy phone has minor color fade mark and some scratches on the screen but over all phone works very well and i am happy this was my first used purchased i usally buy new but since they no longer sell this phone new is really not an option i am very satisfied i got what i paid for.note the phone is not factory reset so numbers , photos , media and call history were still in the device so i had verizon clear it and reset it due to a lock placed on the security settings recommend factory reset before selling any product just so theirs no issue on privicy	1
The Razr may have been out awhile but it has alot of under the hood improvements in different versions and is still a great phone . Slim , well made with a great feel . Verizon has the best customer service and signal access of any carrier I have ever had and I have had all of them .	1
I just upgraded to this Motorola Razr . Like most of you , when this came out I really , really wanted one , but they were just too pricey . Now the price is within reason , so I went for it and extended my plan.I 'm not sure what all the complaints are about . The phone is very thin and once in your pocket you hardly know it 's there , and the lack of an external antenna makes it much easier to get out of your pocket . It has a nice feel to it and is wide enough so it does n't feel like a toy . I have very small hands and have little trouble working everything with one hand . The `` flat '' buttons do n't bother me , but I wish the OK button in the middle of the toggle ring was raised up just a bit . I find myself using my thumbnail to press it.I 'm having no trouble with hearing people , and the ringers are just loud enough for me . The complaint about several button being located on the flip up cover are not a real problem . If they were on the lower part of the phone you would be pressing them all the time.Yes , the screen is difficult to see in bright daylight , but are n't they all , including most cameras and PDA's.The voice activation feature worked right away , after installing some contacts , and made few mistakes.I also got the GPS Maps feature and the Web option . I have not had a chance to really test the GPS , but it did locate my position within a house or two . The Web option seems to work very well and I was able to get lots of info quite easily and rather quickly.I did spend some time with Verizon on the phone to learn how to activate these features and learn how to use them , but I 've always found Verizon service to be excellent , and the person stayed with me until I had all the features down.I was told that the Razr has gone through some software changes and unlike the stories I 've heard , the top does not feel like it 's going to fly off the phone across the room . It feels really solid considering how thin it is.I would say if you 've been waiting now is the time . It looks like they 've gotten some of the bugs out of the phone , and while it does take awhile to get over the learning curve , for any advance features , I really like this phone a lot.Is it perfect ? Not at all , but it is extremely popular , and it 's been around long enough so you can find just about anything for this phone on the Net.I would have given it 5 stars , but it 's just confusing enough learning how to use it I had to give it 4.Also , like others have said : If you want a decent camera get a decent camera . If you want a decent PDA get a decent PDA . If you want an iPod get an iPod . This is a very good phone with lots of extra features , but it 's not perfect . Personally , I do n't think the perfect phone exists -- yet .	1
I do n't really care about the multimedia features -- when I want music , I use my Ipod shuffle and when I want pictures , I use a digital camera -- so I 'll focus on the device as a phone rather than a music/video player or camera.Pros -- The looks and size , of course . I do n't like carrying a wireless on a belt clip so love to slip this baby in my shirt pocket -- Nice , easy-to-read screen . I would n't want to watch TV on it , but that is n't why I buy a wireless phone. -- VZ Navigator . This was what inspired me to switch from Cingular . It is a fantastic feature . I 've tested it about ten times and it has been spot on , with accurate on-screen prompts , voice instructions , and estimated time of arrival . It turns me right into the driveway I need . If you miss a turn , it recalculates new instructions in a matter of seconds . The only down side is that it works from the quickest route and has no way for you to override that . For instance , I went to friend 's house and it had me get on a toll road for a few miles . This WAS the shortest route , but not one I would normally have taken. -- Voice recognition system works great . It does n't have to be `` taught '' and can access all items in the contact list , prepare a blank text message , or dial a dictated number -- Clearest calls I 've had in a wireless phone . You sometimes hear `` the people I 'm talking to ca n't tell I 'm on a wireless . '' That 's been my experience with this handset.Cons -- Strength of reception not quite as good as a handset with an external antenna , even a stubby one. -- I wish they had n't taken away the vibrate+ring option . The Razr has to be either on vibrate with no sound or ring . I also wish there was some sort of external LED to indicate when I missed a call or have voice mail . As is , you have to open the Razr to check this . An NEC handset I had a few years ago had very nice system with different color LEDs. -- Verizon 's proprietary menu system is more difficult to use than the organic Motorola one and takes away some customization options such as setting hot keys . I also have n't found a way to turn off unnecessary prompts ( `` Do you really want to delete this missed call ? '' ) . There is also no way ( at least that I have found ) to change the red band at the top and bottom of the screen . It only looks decent with some sort of red wallpaper. -- Verizon has the phone locked down so it 's difficult or impossible to add pictures and ringtones without paying them. -- It 's plastic ( the Amazon review is just plain wrong on this point ) . I wish there was still the option of buying a metal Razr like the first generation ones . I would have paid extra for it . Like all phones , I 'm sure it will scratch with use and be more susceptible to breaking. -- I could not synchronize the built in calendar with Outlook . I subscribed to a separate calendar synchronization program from Verizon ( iDatebook ) which works well but creates a separate calendar rather than using the built in one. -- The Razr uses BREW for applications so there are fewer available than in java . I particularly miss World Mate for international travel ( especially the currency converter ) and a shopping list application. -- It 's CMDA only so for for international travel , I 've had to unlock an old handset and will just buy prepaid SIMsAll in all , though , the V3m may be my favorite wireless handset of the seven I 've owned over the years .	1
The main reason we got this headset is for my girlfriend , who has fairly tiny ears . Most headsets fall off , while this one stays on quite well comparatively . The audio quality , while not the greatest , gets the job done .	1
PROS : price ( $ 5 ) , great sound - both easy to hear me and those speaking to me , small , reliable thus far despite 10 or 15 drops/falls/etc.CONS : must charge in the provided `` charger case '' , does not easily work with two phones ( though I have a fairly simple workaround now ) , terrible ear attachment ( that breaks when you take it off to charge the headset ) For the paid price of $ 5 ( assuming my rebate shows up ) , this was a steal . For me to give this 4 stars , honestly I have had to use two workarounds:1 ) I replaced the terrible ear attachment loop with a jabra ear gel I have left from an old headset . It works much much better than the Samsung provided ear loop . I have already broken both ear loops provided with the headset because you have to take them on and off to charge it . Dumb design.2 ) I activate pairing on the device each time I want to switch from my work blackberry to my personal palm phone . It 's a bit annoying , but for $ 5 its quite doable.I have received compliments on the sound ( so much better than the wired headsets I used to use ) , it is great not to have to constantly fiddle with a cord that gets stuck somewhere , and with the jabra gel it stays in even when my 1 year old is banging me on the head : ) Still , for the money , if I had to do it again , I would spring for the $ 15 ( after rebate ) WEP 700 . Similar sound quality , but you do n't need the charger case to charge it : Samsung WEP700 Bluetooth Wireless HeadsetMy wife has one and loves it .	1
The headset works pretty well with my treo 755p . In fact , it 's the best headset I 've found for the treo ( tried plantronics and motorola previously without success ) . However , the ear hooks were missing from the package and Samsung customer service would n't even speak to me without me providing my phone 's ESN numbers . WTH ? I also attempted to make a request on Samsung 's service website , which also would not function correctly . I called Amazon CS and they sent a replacement after 4 minutes on the phone . AWESOME !	1
Charges fast and and stays charged for a while , has plenty capabilities and looks good , too . Also fits comfortably in the ear .	1
This is my second bluetooth that I have bought and it is great . Very good to have a ear bud fits in my ear and wo n't fall , comes with three sizes , but only one thing wrong with it if you wear it for hours and hours could start to hurt a little but take it off for ten minutes and you 're ready for a couple more hours . Best bluetooth ever	1
Love it ! I just need to learn how to use all of its features ! : - ) Thank you !	1
I have used the Samsung WEP200 bluetooth headset for about 3 months . I 've found it small in size and very convenient to use . I was able to adjust the rubber earpiece to a certain position that is very comfortable for me to wear . I feel it is secured in my ear and am not worry about having it fall out due to lack of a over-the-ear hook like some other headsets . Since I wear glasses , I prefer not to have the over-the-ear hook models.I paired it up with my Razr V3i without a problem . I have also tried it with a Powerbook to listen to internet radio . It works very well . I read somewhere it also works with Skype , but I 've never tried that.The sound is clear on both ends of phone calls . However , in windy condition or noisy areas , the sound quanlity suffers a lot at the other end of my connection . I think this is not suitable to use around crowded areas like the city streets or the malls etc . But it performs perfectly when used in the car while driving or in a relatively quiet setting.The charger is a good design that also functions as a carrying case . Overall , I am happen with the purchase .	1
Never have a problem with dropped calls . The ear hook took me months actually to figure out but I face the loop up with respect to the unit if I hold it horizontally ( 90 degrees to the unit ) and it stays in perfectly and comfortably . My only issue is that if there is too much noise around me I can not hear the call , but except for a piece that plugs into the ear any bluetooth will have this problem .	1
Besides easily being lost while moving around it has performed well even when the phone is in the car and the device is in my ear .	1
ive tried many other blu tooth head sets and none of them worked for me so i was looking for a wired head set but my cell phone uses an adapter and i didnt like that so i thought i would try this wep 200 , and it worked great but kept falling out of my ear , i even wore it in the swimming pool because i forgot i had it on , i dried it off and it kept working.late this spring it finally fell out of my ear into the yard and i lost it . this fall the neighbor kids who play in my large yard found it . it was covered with dirt and had survived mowings twice a week the sprinkler system every day , thunderstorms and just being in the damp outdoors for 3 months.to make a long story short , i 'm still using it , i have it on right now . i solved the problem of it falling off by purchasing the ear hooks for it , they are cheap so i have bought several and they really work.Samsung WEP180 / WEP200 / WEP210 Bluetooth Headset Hook [ OEM ] AAET180SBEBSTD	1
This Bluetooth is Very Good , Sound Loud and Clear , The Ear Plug Hurt ` s a Little .But Other than That , Works very well.You Can ` t Find Anything better for the price .	1
So far I 'm pretry impressed with this unit . This headset is currently paired with a Blackberry 8800.Pros -1 ) Audio - ... is stellar . Yes , its prone to interference , but I 've yet to see a unit that does n't occasionally give you a bit of static ( JX10 - I 'm looking at you ! ) . Callers were impressed to hear that I was using a headset.2 ) Pairing - I 've always thought this process to be a bit obtuse , but I guess it drives down costs to have the much-vaunted `` multi-funtion '' button . I find it annoying . That said , pairing was quick and easy with this unit and it **stays** paired for hours at a time.3 ) Fit - Stays paired and stays in my ear for hours at a time . Does it hurt ? Heck , even my ears ca n't stand canalphones . I stand at 6 feet and yet I have the earcanals of a 5 year old , I guess . I do n't have a problem using this set all day , but my ears are still a bit sore . Still , this is much better than other models I 've used ( JX10 - I 'm still looking at you ! ) . For the record , I 'm using the smallest gel . The WEP200 gives you three different sizes.4 ) Price - one of the cheapest BT headsets around . I 've tried expensive , I 've tried cheap , I 've tried middle of the road . So far , the WEP200 beats em all , even when not factoring in the cost.5 ) Range - does n't matter what side of my body this unit is on , it almost always makes a clear connection to the BB 8800 . I also use this unit to take VOIP calls via Cisco IP Communicator on my Dell D620 laptop and iChat audio on my Macbook Pro . It gives you just enough freedom to roam . You start loosing your signal at about twenty feet in clear line of sight.Cons -1 ) Size - Unit is super tiny ! It gets lost in my shirt pocket , my jacket pocket , left on the counter . Annoying when you are getting a call and your headset is still paired to your mobile . Its never a fun scramble , especially when someone important is at the other end . `` Hang on a second ! I need to find the headset ! ! ! `` 2 ) Charger - Not thrilled about the charger/carrying case , but if it helps keep the size of the headset down , I ca n't complain too much . I feel compelled to get my wife to buy one , just so we 'd have two chargers around the house - one for upstairs and another downstairs . They 're cheap enough , so why not ? Overall , this is the best BT headset I 've ever used in the three years that I 've been using them . Good show , Samsung .	1
This Bluetooth is so small and discrete yet it picks up your voice perfectly . I highy recommend it !	1
The Samsung WEP200 works perfectly with my Treo 700p . It was easy to set up . The charger/case is cool . It is small and protects the headset . Sounds is really great compared to other headsets . It is nice and loud even while driving with the radio on . Callers in the other end do not notice I am using a headset . I would definitely recommend this headset .	1
This is my 4th bluetooth headset , and I 'm getting frustrated trying to find one that both works good and fits good . This one works great , but frankly I do n't understand why that ca n't design one that is comfortable to wear.Once you figure out how it is supposed to be worn , it is n't too bad , however I can only wear it about an hour at a time . Most of the time I keep it in my shirt pocket , and put it in my ear when my phone rings.I 'm keeping it , because it works better than all the other ones . Just do n't understand why they do n't make them like earbud headset .	1
The wep200 is fantastic , its super small and you hardly notice its there . It pairs up very easily and the battery life is great . Only one complaint , its a bit crackly compared to my old motorola headset , but its hardly noticible unless you have the phone more that 5 ft away .	1
I have owned 2 of these and its the best bluetooth I have used . I like it much better than the WEP400 I am currently using . I gave one to a friend and the other to girl when I got my WEP400 . I wish I would have given away the WEP400 instead . This is a great product . It has only fell out of my ear once . Go ahead get one you will not regret it .	1
Purchased August 25 , 2007I love that it does n't look like other Bluetooth headsets that are huge and flashy . Connectivity and sound quality are superb . I ca n't give it 5 stars simply because it not very comfortable to wear for long calls . It becomes painful to wear after prolonged use .	1
This is a great little item . I stress the 'little ' part . You wo n't feel like the Borg with this in your ear . As a matter of fact , you wo n't even realize it is there . One thing I would recommend . Get the little attachment so you can loop it over your ear . It is available from Samsung for 5.95 I believe . Without it , you will have an extremely hard time keeping the headset in your ear . And , it is so small and light , you may not even realize that it has fallen out . It will drive you crazy without this piece . I do n't understand why it is not included with the headset - it is that necessary . I have looked at the more expensive ones . I see no reason to pay the big bucks . Get it !	1
The headset volume , size , comfort and ease of wearing is wonderful , the weakest feature of this headset is the ear loop . The connection to the headset broke within a week of ownership . However the replacement piece is designed much better and is easily available . Great headset for the money .	1
This is by far the best headset I 've used . Both performance & comfort , I 've not found anything better yet . If you 're looking at any current Motorola headsets , stop now and look no further . This unit worked equally well on both Moto Q & Samsung U740.Pros:1. in ear design ( no hook ) - I always hated having to wear a hook over your ear because It gets in the way when I wear my sunglasses2 . I like the fact that it has a hard case for protection while not in use and it doubles as a charger base.3 . probably one of the smallest and lightest I 've use.Cons:1 . Have n't really found any yet . ** Make sure you do n't buy the fake ones from ebay/else where . With no tax/shipping , this amazon price is still one of the best price for this out there .	1
This was a very nice bluetooth headset until I lost it . since it so small , I tuck it away and now I ca n't find it ; ( . anyways , I had 2 great headset by Plantronics and samsung . both are very good , but if I had to choose , I would choose Samsung for it connects to my phone without too much hassle compare to plantronics 510 voyager , where I had to constantly reset my phone to get connect it . on the other hand Plantronics Voyager 510 voice is far superior to Samsungs ( IMO ) .	1
Comfort : The WEP200 is great for people who wear glasses because there is n't an extra hook that goes over your ear . The tiny loop on the WEP200 earpiece is flexible and does a good job of hooking or bracing the unit in your ear . You can also rotate it to fit it in your left or right ear . I 've been able to freely talk and move my head around without feeling like the headset would fall out.Battery life : The battery life seems to be shorter than my Plantronics Voyager 510 , but it 's understandable with the much smaller size of the WEP200 . I really have n't had an issue with the battery , as long as I remember to take it out of the car with me to charge overnight or during the day . I have to take it with me because , as of March 2008 , there does n't seem to be a car charger accessory for this headset.Update May 2008 : As M. Cirone points out in the comment below , there are now car charger accessories available for the WEP 200 ! Sound quality : The sound quality is n't as good as my Plantronics Voyager either , but it 's still good enough for phone calls . People on the other end do n't seem to have problems understanding me and I can hear them well enough.Ease of use : The buttons are big and easy to reach , but take a little bit of force . Since the headset is so small though , it 's easy enough to hold it in place while you press buttons.I also had no trouble connecting this headset to my Nokia 6300 phone . In fact , I can switch between this in my car and my Plantronics at home without any issues.Overall , this is an excellent , inexpensive headset , especially for people who wear glasses . It 's definitely tiny though so it 's very easy to lose if you 're not careful .	1
I just recently bought my fourth WEP200 . This is a great headset . Everyone I 've bought it for loves its . Its small , discrete and stays in your ear . Takes a bit to figure out how to put it in your ear . But once it is in , it stays in . Very easy to connect with my phones : LGVX9700 , LGVX9400 , Samsung SCH-a950 , Samsung U550 , LGVX8500 . Great buy . Should have bought more than 1 when it was 4.99 after 20 mir .	1
I use the Sprint Mogul and as many users of this phone know there are inherent problems with the bluetooth on this phone . Most people have the best luck with the Jawbone headsets and a few various Plantronics headsets that cost over $ 100 , but I 'm cheap and decided to try this model . It 's great.I had absolutely not problems whatsoever pairing the headset and keeping it paired . The call quality is really good as well . I 've specifically asked people who I talk to using the headset what it sounds like on their end and they tell me they ca n't tell I 'm on a headset at all . The volume is good . Sometimes I even have to turn it down a notch or two.This product would get five stars except that sometimes I get a little static when the battery gets low , but that 's not very often . Standby and talk times are very good.Unless you just HAVE to have a super-fancy headset , do yourself a favor and give this one a shot . I honestly ca n't imagine bluetooth getting much better than this .	1
i bought this one along with the more expensive Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset , in my opinion , the wep200 is as good as the Plantronic one , if not better .	1
This is one of the best headsets ive ever owned..You have to get jabra eargels with it ..I shook my head harder than I should have and it stayed snug . Shoots out to samsung for a great product ...	1
This is without a doubt the _loudest_ bluetooth headset i 've ever used . Even for the friend of mine who mumbles constantly on the phone i 've never had to use this about 50 % volume . I 've tried it on four different phones and had it work great with all of them . Sound quality is top notch too.Tip : Try all the different tips , and try it in both ears .	1
This bluetooth headset is tiny compared to others I 've researched . I purchased it for my daughter , and she loves it . It paired easily with her Env2 Verizon phone . I called her to test it and I could hear her clearly and she reports she can hear well on it too . There was no feedback noise or echo . She reports that it is very comfortable , and she has been wearing it for long periods of time without a problem . The standby time is 70 hours , so it does n't have to be constantly charging . Great product .	1
I have a special standard for Bluetooth devices . I 've had several of them over the last few years . This one is the lightest , and worked well for about a year . Then it stopped . It 's been my experience with Bluetooth listening devices that a year is all you can expect , at best . Right now I use a Motorola from Costco that 's on it 's 4th month . We 'll see how long it lasts .	1
Expected a small earphone based on reviews but was still surprised at it 's tiny size when first looking at it up close.Medium ear `` hook '' worked for me - suggest playing with this ( removing the rubber hook and adjusting it on the ear piece ) until getting right fit - the bud goes in ear and added loop of rubber is supposed to counter against the curve in another part of your outer ear - genius design imho and when this thing is in , even jumping up and down or shaking your head or tapping your head ( yes tried that too , silly I know ... ) will not dislodge this.Paired easily with a samsung ach930 , sound is great and the other side of the call is also impressed , no complaints of echo or static.Have a plantronics 510 which is good , this wep200 is smaller yet compares in quality to the plantronics .	1
As others have said , the functionality of this headset is very good . The biggest bonus to me is that it handles the Palm Treo 's marginal Bluetooth quite well . My Plantronics Discovery 640 had great sound , mic , and fit , but would always ( I mean literally 100 % of the time ) drop the BT connection about 1 minute after ending a phone call on my Treo 700p and I 'd have to reconnect . Even though I am quite sure it is the Treo 's fault , I 'd rather spend $ 50 for a new headset than $ 400 for a new smartphone . With the WEP200 , it stays connected all day after many calls.The volume is a little low and it appears that every time you shut it off to recharge , the volume resets to its default middle level . I always have to crank it up to its highest level since it fits rather loosely.Which leads to my main beef : fit . As many have noted fit is this device 's biggest weakness . I am using the largest rubber thingy and it is still somewhat loose in my ear . I can shake my head and it wo n't fall out , but it just does n't really feel like its well-placed in my ear . I am going to keep it just because it works so well , but it 's a serious bummer that this drawback keeps it from being my perfect headset . They must have really small ears in Samsung R & D ... ; I 'll try the Jabra ear gels another poster suggested , or perhaps some foam earphone covers . I just need to make sure that whatever I put on does n't keep it from fitting in its charging case ...	1
I love the clear sounds not to crazy like everyone else with the hook but its a deal at this price seen it at sprint for 49.95 so its a deal ! clear no static and the only thing I have a problem is with the volume I put people on mute ( its prob me not the bluetooth )	1
For the $ 20 I paid for it , I am very satisfied . The size is great and barely noticeable on your ear . Battery life is also great .	1
What can you say if you get a great product for a steal price ( $ 5 assuming I get my $ 20 mail in rebate ) . The voice quality is very good , and connectivity is easy as well . The product delivers what it 's intended for .	1
The first thing I noticed with the Samsung WEP200 when I first connected it to my Treo 750 was how fast it connected and how great the quality was.I have owned many Bluetooth Headsets and most of them had unusable static or they would not connect to my device in a timely fashion or even connect after the unit was in standby for long periods of time.The WEP200 connects quickly and the sound quality is superb.People on the other end ca n't even tell I am on a Bluetooth headset.The earpiece fits into my ear snugly and is fairly comfortable for about a few hours and then it gets a bit on the sore side . I wish there was some sort of necklace dongle where it could be placed and taken off when needed.Its small and very light and the range is excellent.Very highly recommended .	1
I had one of these and my dog got hold of it , I bought another one just like it to replace it . I love the size , it sounds great and I could n't be happier with it . I highly recommend this to anyone !	1
I really like this inexpensive lightweight bluetooth headset ! Works well on my end , but sometimes the person on the other end of the call hears an echo . Stays in my ear great without the clip that goes around your ear . It charges up in a protective flip top box , so the headset does n't have to plug directly into wall charger . I store my headset in the small charging box and carry it in the small box in my pocket when not in use . I love it that this was only $ 18 ! ! ! Ca n't beat that price ! !	1
This is a great little item , before I received this It was sometimes hard to keep up with my bluethooth headset . Now I put this on the outside pocket of my handbag and I am good to go , I can find it every time . Be careful when puting the headset in the case if you press to hard you will turn you headset back on other wise it is a great little tool	1
I really do like the case for my Bluetooth . It fits my bluetooth like a glove and helps keep it really nice and safe also from misplacing my bluetooth if I remember to put it in the case . I keep it in my car or my front pocket in my purse . I need to have it close for on Post you will get a ticket if you do not have a hands free communication .	1
I purchased this pouch because I lost two other headsets I had . the pouch arrived when they said it would . Very happy with the service I received . I would buy from them again .	1
Small , cute with a clip that you could hurt someone with . O yes , H500 headset fits very well with a retaining strap and Velcro to make sure it stays there.Motorola BLT-04 Bluetooth Headset Carrying Case	1
This is absolutely the best and most essential accessory to have for your bluetooth wireless headset . I just love it to death ! ! ! Thanks Amazon .	1
It only does not get the 5 stars because it tends to slip off the belt . However it is a perfect protection / carrying case for the motorola Bluetooth ear piece .	1
It is exactly what I wanted . The picture on Amazon does n't show the nifty clip on the back side . Occasionally it dials the phone on accident but it does n't happen as much as it did without it !	1
Here is your basic no thrills case for your bluetooth Headset . IMHO you need something to put your bluetooth into , and here it is . It stretches out , front and back are hard , and elastic holds the sides together with a velcro close on the top that stretches over . On the back is a metal clamp to clip onto your belt or such .	1
This is a great idea ! You have cases for phones so why not have one for your bluetooth . I have a Motorola HS850 earpiece and wanted to make sure that I would not lose or misplace it . This holder clips on to my car visor or my purse so it is handy . It fits my earpiece perfectly . I got one for my husband and brother for their bluetooth . You ca n't beat the quality or the price . I definitely recommend this for anyone that has an earpiece and is constantly misplacing it .	1
This is the second blutooth earpiece I have ever owned . It never feels like its about to fall off my ear and it does n't hurt to wear for several hours.The sound from and to it is very clear and no one on the other end has ever heard any echo or feed back . I use it with an LG Chocolate cellphone . I would buy it again or as a gift for others . The price is right for a great value .	1
Sounds very good on other end.Took a long time for earpiece to soften or maybe my ear confored to it.Buggy . Have to reset once in a while . 1st call sometimes dumps.Good noise control on transmit . Steady noise is eliminated but music and voices still cause interference . I use in 18 wheller . One of very few Bluetooth that can be used there . Very few . Thats why I put up with bugyness .	1
This is my 11th different bluetooth headset that I 've tried over the past year and it 's been been the best , by far , of the ones I 've tried . Is it the best it could be ... .not by a long shot but it works and that goes a long way.I use it for business calls and have yet to be called on it . That within it self makes it a winner but the Gennum nxZen almost works that good . The difference is I can hear this one with relative ease as opposed to the nxZen . If you boost the microphone ( on the nxZen ) gain it decreases the in audio which is a issue . I prefer the `` in-the-ear '' type headset because I 'm always using it in loud places like airports etc . The built in boom slides forward and provides excellent out audio for the receiver . I still , struggle at times , hearing the caller . The talk time , so far , is very good . I can wear it for several hours but at some point my ear does start hurting.I use this with my Treo 700w . It drops the pairing on a semi-regular basis . It was easy to pair to my original phone but I 've not been able to pair it with any other thing.Overall , if you been waiting then wait no more . It 's worth price .	1
I have had several headsets , and this one has lastest longer than any of them . It holds a charge for a long time , whereas the other ones would die sooner.Good sound quality , comfortable fit . Although the microphone extends as a boom , I never use it extended . The quality and comfort are just fine without it extended .	1
Nice stylist product . I am using it with my Treo 700P . Crystal clear sound quality and different volument levels that suit me ( use hearing aids ) . Long lasting battery time . I charge it on the weekends only.Cons : occasional loss of bluetooth communication between phone and headset .	1
It 's been a few years now since I had this bluetooth headset , but out of the MANY that I 've used , this was by far my favorite . I could listen to streaming music with it from my phone and it stayed on my ear really well . This is the only headset I 've had where people could actually hear me all the time . The sliding boom mic made a big difference.The downfall of this model , as other reviewers have also written , is that the rubber tips that hold the headset on your ear break off with time . I used superglue and prolonged the life of mine for a while , but it was annoying .	1
I would have given this a 5-star if it was only a clip/wired BT headset . It works flawlessly when used in that configuration . When you use it as an in-ear only headset , there is a tiny ( barely noticeable , but there ) amount of static . The person on the other end never complains . I do like the fact that for $ 20 you can convert it into to different styles.Two suggestions:1 ) I STRONGLY suggest using the included ear foam in either configuration . This makes the unit fit tighter and reduces background noise . This way you can turn down the volume a bit and the sound is clearer.2 ) Tinker with the volume on your phone AND the headset . You need to find the sweet spot for this to really sound good . Once you do , you 'll be happy .	1
it is prety good , but it has 2 problems , people have a bit of a hard time hearing you nothing mayor , and sometimes it acts funny but i dont know if it has to do more with incompatibility with my phone or it is the headset but these is also minor , 99 % of the time it works fine	1
I had seen reviews by folks who had problems with this unit , but tried it anyway as the price was great.The initial charge took less than the 6 hours stated in the documentation , but I 've been using it for a week and have n't needed to recharge it as of yet.The reviewer who recommended using the foam cover was absolutely right . It eliminates most of the background or wind noise . The unit stays on my ear reliably . I use the included ear hook.While the output from the microphone could be a little better , I do n't have to speak excessively loudly to use it.The LEDs are needlessly bright , but since I do n't see them when the unit is on my ear , this is not a big deal .	1
Fits Great , Battery Life Is Great , One of the best ! Comfortable on my ear and pairing was as east as pie !	1
I had to write in and contradict the review saying you can only use this on your right ear . the instructions show you how to switch it , and you can even switch the volume control from the bottom to the top , so it is on the top regardless of which ear you use it on . NOTE : if you want a Y splitter for car or home charging for this , you have to use model P000 , not the one that comes up on a search , because you need a splitter with 2 mini-USBs ( one for your phone , one for the headset ) . Only had it one day , so ca n't comment on the other issues .	1
This is a much , much better headset than the old HS500 . This has the BT 2.0 standard . It delivers better range ( aka more than ten feet ) , great sound quality and works with more devices than anything i 've seen in a similar price range . The battery life is great too.Its downsides are the multifunction button that is way to easy to press , and the fact that it does not have the ability to filter out non voice sounds .	1
This is a nice looking piece that works well . Voice quality is excellent , but people I 've called report there is sometimes a slight buzzing when I am talking to them , although they can still hear me well . Battery life is excellent and it charges fast . it is comfortable and lightweight , I am glad I did n't pay more , and this one is fine for everyday casual use .	1
Overall I have had a good experience with this device . Here are some of the pros and cons so you can get some basis for comparison when purchasing one BT headset : PROS1 . Price . I got this device for $ 33 . I do n't think you can get a comparable BT headset for a lower price.2 . Sound Quality . This device has good volume level and low static . I have streched it all the way to the range limit ( 30 ft. ) and the call quality is still good with no static . I have left my phone or computer in the living room/middle level of my townhome and have gone up and down the stairs to other rooms without loosing the call.3 . Compatibility . I have n't had any issues pairing this device up with the following devices : Motorola PEBL , Nokia E62 and HP Pavillion laptop . I have used remote commands such as voice commands , redial or answer with the two phones with no issues , and have used it with Skype and MSN Messenger without any problem . One user commented that the personalized/group ring tones did not transmit to the BT headset , but this is a limitation of the phone , because the MotoPEBL does not transmit a specific ring tone assigned to a person , and rather a default one , but the Nokia E62 sends the proper ring tone to the headset so you know who is calling without having to look at the phone ( good when driving ! ) 4 . Battery life . I have not tried really long calls so I can not comment on exact talk time , but overall I have used it continously in stand-by plus regular calls ( for me 10-15 minutes , 4-5 calls a day ) without recharging for 3-4 days.CONS:1 . Bad Design . As noted by other users , the device wiggles in your ear and you feel it is going to fall when you walk , move your head ( sudden movements ) or even driving ( believe it or not , the inertia when making turns on you car makes this BT headset to move away from your ear , almost falling ) . A strong wind will knock it out from your ear . It fits ok , though , and does not hurt your ear ( not heavy at all ) . Perhaps that is the main reason why it wiggles so much , maybe it is too light.2 . Powering on/off . Since it only has one main button ( two small ones for volume +/- and mute ) that you use for power , pairing , answering or dial commands , then you can , for example , get into pairing mode when simply turning it on , or if attached to a phone , you may redial a call rather than turning it off . Once you learn how to use it and pay attention to the blue led signals , it is ok , but I think it requires one extra button for power on/off.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase . If it were n't for the two CONs , I would have rated it with 5 starts .	1
I love this headset for the money ! I 've been using it for a couple years now and I do n't know how I ever lived without it . I have gotten my money 's worth a hundred times over . I find it comfortable enough that I forget I 'm even wearing it . I have some issues with clarity in a few spots , but if I hold my phone closer to the headset in the fuzzy spots , it 's okay ... and that 's not in a lot of places , just happens once in a while . It 's easy to pair with any phone too . I used to have a motorola and recently switched to a Samsung . It paired up with no problem . I recommend this product . It 's a great place to start if you 're looking for your first bluetooth .	1
This headset fit great in my ear , its look is very cool , but a few flaws:1 . Volume buttons are not easy to reach once the unit is fitted in your ear.2 . Using it in windy conditions may get you in an uncomfortable conversation ( hello ? ... are you there ? It feels like you 're within a hurricane ... ) , and I do n't mean only outdoors , you maybe inside your car with the A/C on and if it 's blowing right at your face , you 'll get this kind of problem	1
I bought this primarily to use with Skype . It works mostly good , and it is b3etter than the H820 that I own . However , with Skype the quality drops a little bit . I am sort of satisfied with it , but I still get static sometimes . The Bluetooth connector that came with it will not connect . I had to buy a `` cheap '' bluetooth connector by Logitechg .	1
I spent about 4 hours doing online research on which BT headset to get my wife for her cell phone ( Motorola SLVR L7c ) She wanted something cool looking and had already expressed interest in the H500 , but I wanted to double check and make sure there was n't anything better for around the same price . So after a few hours of reading reviews on a dozen or so different headsets , I finally decided just to settle for the H500 , I was really interested in some of the Plantronics sets , but she did n't care for the design.. I was a little worried about the H500 because the reviews are kinda so-so.. They 're either good reviews or bad reviews . I got it for her so she would n't have to fumble around in the car with a phone so how it performs in a vehicle was going to be the make or break point with it . I 'm pleased to say that the headset performs way better than I expected it to.Getting started is a breeze . All you have to do is charge the headset for about 2 hours ( the LED light will go off once the battery is charged ) once it 's done charging you have to pair it up with your phone . All you do is press and hold the call button until the LED light stops blinking and stays lit , then you have your phone set to hands free mode and follow the simple steps on the phone ( For us it was as simple as the phone finding the H500 and entering the 4-digit pin of 0000 ) The phone saved the settings and we were all set.Using the headset is no brainer basically . There 3 buttons ; Main call/multi button & Volume up & down buttons . Pressing these buttons in various combos will yield different results like mute , hold , transfer , 3-way , etc . The retail package comes with a handy fold out that has all the functions and how to access them.The build quality of the headset is great as well.. The headset is about 2 inches from earclip to mic . Its very small and very comfortable to wear . The ear clip is removable to you can use it on either ear as well . The buttons feel solid as well.Now to the actual sound quality . The headset has performed great in all the scenarios we 've tried so far.. Which has been in the house while watching TV , In the car with the stereo & windows up & down & in an office environment . I was most impressed with how it performed while driving , There is no static or any background noise at all and even with the radio and window down , the user can clearly be heard both ways . Again very impressive . The only environment we have n't really tried yet was at the store . I will update once I 've tested that as well.I ca n't really comment on the battery life yet , because we 've only had the unit for a day or so , but so far the unit has yet needed to be charged.So to summarize , great headset overall , feels & looks great , sound quality is super , voices are loud and clear . Performance in the car , home & office was excellent and the price Amazon offers is great compared to retail . I 'm very very satisfied ( and relieved ! ) that this unit performs as well as it does .	1
This is a fairly good Bluetooth headset . Very easy to use and it feels comfortable when placed on the ear . Audio quality is good as well as the mic . The earpiece though felt a little bit flimsy and would not stay on my ear properly . The one thing though that I had a problem with was the battery life on the headset . I got barely 2 full hours of talk time before it started beeping like crazy which meant that I had to charge it soon .	1
Yes it matches my phone . Excellent head set , I hear them and they hear me . What else do you need.Motorola H500 - Headset ( over-the-ear ) - wireless - Bluetooth	1
For under $ 20 , this blow the over-priced Jabra 's out of the water . I can actually hear other people talk without holding the ear piece in my ear . Battery lasts a couple of weeks without recharging .	1
After a small amount of screwing around the H500 connected with myNokia N75 without a hitch . I find that if you firmly place the earloop around the base of the ear and then fold in the receiver in fitsfirmly and does n't come loose . I agree that the volume could go higher ; however , in a quiet room it is adequate . I 'm told that I 'm clearlyheard on the other end of the connection . This is also in a quiet room.Small and lite . I think this a rather nifty piece of gear .	1
I had one but ordered this one for my husband to give him freedom while driving and doing chores around the house . He loves his as much as I love mine and now , I dont have to share .	1
This well priced replacement battery was exactly what I was looking for ! It holds a charge well . I have purchased others that did not meet my expectations but this one was just perfect !	1
The product worked very well as a replacement battery and was very easy to install . I could not tell any different from the OEM battery .	1
Would you believe it ? I still have an employee that wo n't ditch his original Motorola Razr v3 Flip phone ! I thought I could finally upgrade him to a smartphone when he called and complained that his battery would n't charge , but he just wanted a replacement . Oh well , you do what you have to : - )	1
This battery charges quickly and holds the charge longer than others I have used . I find it worth the higher price .	1
I bought a expensive Outter case before get this one and I was surprised because this one feels better for my Galaxy Note . Of course I would recommend , specially for those who does n't want to expend a lot of money in a case .	1
I really like the design but keep in mind you are sacrificing protection for aesthetics . It really only covers the back of the phone which in my opinion is the least important part . The screen is largely unprotected except for a slight lip around the edge which may or may not protect the screen but I have yet to drop it.You really have to press fairly hard on the buttons to elicit a response which gets annoying after a while . I solved this by cutting the button part out with an exacto knife.I have a otterbox style case for this as well but it adds too much bulk to an already large phone so this is my go-to case .	1
As most of the reviews have been stating ... ..this is an excellent case for the Note ! All openings are exactly right , easy to turn screen on with button on upper right of phone , stylus comes out easy , able to charge and use cameras . As one reviewer stated it does secure screen protector - case has just enough over-lap to secure . Can have screen down and will not touch surface . BoxWave shipped this on arrived on time in excellent condition .	1
This item is as described . It saved my phone when it was knocked in the bath by my 6 yo son . Is attractive and was a good purchase . I would order again.Recommended .	1
This case is pretty slim yet protects the phone from the elements . Also this case is great because when the phone is turned screen side down the screen does not actually hit the surface because the case lip extends past , a feature which I like . It 's ease and peace of mind to know my equipment is well protected .	1
Fits well on my AT & T Galaxy Note . Some holes might be a little at the microphone but no big deal . Dropped my phone once and it gave cushion to the fall . Thank god..	1
I got this for my International Galaxy note N7000 and it fits great . I would recommend buying a screen protector with it as well . It works great to protect your phone and it looks great as well.My phone is white so it makes the case look like a lighter blue , I think it 's a really pretty color and I love it . It 's see through so I put some fortunes from fortune cookies to show through on the back for fun.But just be warned that the product picture is of the `` blue '' galaxy note phone , so if you have a white one the case will appear lighter in color .	1
got this case when I bought my GNote and I must say it looked sexy and great ! then I got a leather case to replace it ! but for the price the quality is great , and looks even better !	1
This does NOT fit the Verizon version of the Samsung Note II . I made the classic mistake of not reading the description . I thought & # 34 ; International Version & # 34 ; meant it would fit all phones in all nations -- dummy , me ! I searched , again , but can not find any that does fit the Verizon version in this design . It may be released later . On the other hand , the cover feels great in the hand . I just ca n't use it .	1
What can I say , I bought this for my wife 's Note a while back . Its cheap but fits well without added bulk . The grippy sides really helped holding this larger device and she loves that most . All the ports are open and the power and volume buttons , though covered , function perfectly.If you want a simple , affordable skin that will protect from bumps and bruises without much added bulk , for the price of a large Starbucks latte ' you ca n't beat this one !	1
Fits the Note perfectly . Great cover and protection without adding bulk to the phone . Nice back design also . Looks like quality material used .	1
I purchased this case for my Note and was very suprised at how nice the case was for the price . I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a nice cheap case .	1
This case is made of a firmer material than the silicone cases , which is perfect because it does n't stretch or get caught when going in or out of a pocket or case . It hugs the phone tight enough that many people wo n't know you have a case on it . At first I thought the case was making button use difficult , but then I took the case off and realized the Galaxy Note buttons are terrible even without a case . It 's not much more difficult with the case on , and you do get used to it . The textured grip area on the sides is a nice tough as well .	1
I have owned many phones over the years and a lot of expensive cases.This by far is the best case I have come across . It does not add any bulk to the phone and the pure comfort of holding it in the hand is speechless . The embossed sides , the nice rubbery feel gives good comfort and it 's not a dust magnet.I only ordered this case because the the one that I had did not protect the corners of the phone when dropped . I will definitely keep this brand in mind in the future . It 's that good and I definitely recommend this for anyone who wants good protection , comfort and style . Thank you BoxWave ...	1
Great case , fits perfect . All holes align correctly with buttons , mic 's and micro USB on my Galaxy Note . Definitely recommend to anyone wanting additional protection at a low cost .	1
Great body case it provide very good protection with out adding bulk , easy to put on and fit perfectly Highly recommended .	1
Like all the other reviews , this case is great ! I really like that it has a lip so it 'll protect the screen if I set it down that way . It 's flexible but like the gel kind , and it looks great .	1
I 'm using this case with the AT & T version of the Note . It gets 5 stars for the high quality/price ratio . The material is soft and flexible , the cut-outs line up ok ... not perfect , but they do n't cause any functionality issues . I love the textured hand grips on the sides . The hard buttons require a little more pressure to push , but i prefer to have the covered over having them open , but recessed under the case . The s-pen opening is fine with my case , I have no problem getting it out . It does make the Note feel noticeably heavier than the naked phone , but there is a lot of area to cover on the note . It 's not a perfect case , but I 've paid $ 30 on cases for other `` iDevices '' that had similar issues . Boxwave shipped pretty quickly , but there was no tracking available .	1
Pros : + Cheap ! + Inexpensive+ Works just greawtCons- I did n't get to waste $ 30 on a piece of plastic to protect my phoneA previous discriminating iphone user ... . i love saving money	1
Pros -- Cheap- Protects the phone from all types of mishaps ( straight drop on corner of phone , or when walking/running and the phone goes for an unintended `` slide '' on the concrete ) - Does not increase the bulk of the phone considerably and it 's relatively light weight- Makes the buttons more difficult to press so less accidental presses of the rocker or power key ( some may not like this but I do ) - Easy to remove and replace ( great for people that do battery swaps instead of wall/car-charging all day ) - Increased grip which reduces chance phone will leave the hand unintentionallyCons -I do n't care for the `` wave '' effect on the back and I would prefer an all-matte finish as opposed to the combination matte/gloss finishOverall , this product does exactly what it 's supposed to with added benefits like button protection ( most other cases leave the buttons exposed ) which makes it less likely to accidentally press them . Also , the case wraps to the front of the screen and protrudes about 1/16 '' beyond the glass so it protects the screen if the phone is accidentally slid across the floor or it 's dropped flat on the glass . My only gripe is an aesthetic one but that 's very subjective ... and I do n't think most Galaxy Note owners are very critical about aesthetics . Hopefully this company makes one for the soon-to-be-released Note 2 as I 'll be getting one once it 's released .	1
I highly recommend this case for the Samsung Galaxy Note . I have the international unlocked version of the Note , and it fits perfectly . It 's durable and gives me the peace of mind that the phone is n't going to slip out of my hands . I love the knurled edges that make it easy to grip . The case is also very slim , so you hardly know it 's even there . The case makes the power button harder to press , but I am getting used to it . I have 3 different style USB cables , and none of them could seat entirely in the socket with this case ( the cables would work and allow me to connect/charge my phone , but if you bumped anything , the cable would fall out ) . I ended up using a dremel rotary tool to slightly enlarge the opening in the case around the USB port , and now all of my cables seat properly . These are minor quibbles , though . I love this case .	1
Love this skin , it 's slim and light , but protects the phone very well ! I dropped it already few times , but phone survived with no problems , still looks like brand new !	1
The case fits great , it looks good , and it provides good protection . It is sufficiently thick and elastic to cushion a fall without making the phone much bigger . If this is the style of case you are looking for , you ca n't get a better case . The phone is also easy enough to remove that you can switch between this and another case easily .	1
At first glance , this product seems not as expensive as it looks in the picture . So I got initially disappointed . Looks plasticky/jelly.But when I put it on my note , i realized the benefit of having high grip sides . It was easier to hold my phone now , less likely to slip.And the back looks good according to my taste . The S design looks classy.It has a pretty good fit on my phone .	1
I love it . I have it for 1 year and it is still in the same condition . Very good in the hand . Usable for a & # 34 ; standby mode & # 34 ; with a plastic bracket ( of course , it could be more strong and I would pay more for it ) .	1
It paired easily with my Treo . The sound quality is perfect . No one complained about the sound quality on the other end , like with my Motorolla . It 's comfortable and light . The battery life is good . I am totally happy with it .	1
This is my 4th bluetooth headset , and it is by far the best working headset . It is clear . I can hear while driving , people can hear me like I am talking into the phone.My one complaint is that it does n't fit well on my ear . If they had made the ear loop another 1/4 '' I would be giving this 5 stars . Instead it never feels exactly right , and ends up hurting my ear if I wear it for extended periods.I 'm keeping it , but I am looking for a different way to attach it to my ear .	1
Excellent product , works well , especially with BT phones that have a strong BT signal . Can connect in next room through wall with good enough phone , without the crackling . Excellent battery and quality . Just need to have a small ear for most comfortable fit .	1
If you 've been reviewing Bluetooth headsets , you 've probably heard it all . They do n't fit your ear , they echo , callers ca n't undertand you , the battery dies too quickly ... I purchased this item about a month ago , and have n't found any of these complaints to hold true for this headset.I 've charged it once , and have n't had to re-charge it yet . Sure , I 've only made 5 or 6 short calls on it , but it 's turned on for at least an hour a day during my commute.My wife could tell that I was calling from my car , but she did n't notice a difference between normal road noise and the Bluetooth reception.The headset fits my ear comfortably . You probably have already read that this set does n't insert into your ear canal , but rather rests against it . I found this to be comfortable , and without any side-effects . It 's even comfortable when wearing sunglasses.I 've never heard and echo , nor received complaints of others hearing one.Many reviewers of this and other models seem to dislike the multi-function button . Well , it 's a single button , and it 's used to perform multiple functions . Sometimes you press it for a few seconds , sometimes you just tap it . I primarily use it for 'on ' and 'off ' . 'On ' takes about 2 seconds , and 'off ' takes about 5 or 6 seconds ( although I have to admit , it seems to take just a bit longer than I 'd prefer ... ) to turn off . I 'm not sure why some would complain about this feature , as most phones have one ... I 'm not sure what all the fuss is from other reviewers ( more often on other brands ... ) , but this headset seems perfect to me .	1
This was for my husband . He said that he had trouble with his connections but we did not know if it was the product , where he was at the time of using it or if it was the other parties connection . I would probably buy this again though because of its design and the way it fit .	1
Overall this headset is one of the best I have owned , and I own quite a few . I have 3 different Jabras , a motorola , another plantronics , and various other off brands . This headset is clear and since it fits directly in the ear , more than loud enough . Pairing is a snap . I am currently using it with my new Samsung a990.The only gripe , which is n't really anything serious is this . I wear the headset in my right ear . While driving at night , the blinking of the device is extremely bright . You can see it through the cabin of the vehicle .	1
This is a great product , cofortable and easy to setup . It 's features are wonderful with the battery charger that is included you can recharge you device anywhere at anytime .	1
I needed a new bluetooth after accidentally leaving my HS850 in my shirt pocket just before the wash cycle began . The device I had before that , was the Cardo Scala 500 . I 'd bought that one from Amazon and wound up returning it due to low volume . The HS850 suffered the same symptom . I found myself constantly pressing the headset to my ear while I was listening and turning up the volume which caused a distracting echo for the person I was talking to.So , one of the features I was looking for was a device in which the microphone was not too close to the earpiece . The Discovery 655 seemed to fit the bill . I also read some good reviews on it . I was pleased when I first tried it on and found that it went right into my ear for a perfect fit . This is important for two reasons : 1 ) I wear glasses so , it 's nice not to have to deal with a loop , 2 ) I think having the earpiece so close to my inner ear precludes me from having to turn up the volume . In fact , I have n't touched the volume at all . This is the first bluetooth device that I 've been happy with right out of the box . I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great , comfortable , good-sounding bluetooth .	1
I like this bluetooth mainly because of the fit . I find it stays comfortably in your ear and does n't easily fall off . I previously bought a Motorola blue tooth and dropped it about 5 days after I got it , I could no longer get a connection to my phone and pretty much threw it out . I have dropped this about 2 times already and it still works fine . I like that you can easily rotate to put on your other ear because I can not handle something in my ear for too long . The sound quality is not perfect but I think it is great for the price . I bought one for each of my family members .	1
Plantronics is a world leader in ear-piece peripherals . They manufacture every imaginable headsets from telephone to gaming . The Explorer 330 fits the bill to supplement a bluetooth cellphone and its ease of use and functionality is way superior to a lot of bluetooth headphones out there . I have had mine for about 2 years now and has always worked great . Pairing is not a problem for this headset , once the pairing is recorded in the phone , there are no quirks about pairing it when you need to use it . Distance-wise , it does not conform to the 33ft maximum , but on a personal note , I hardly part the headset with the phone in that distance so it hardly matters according to my intended use . Overall happy with this headset as it has exceeded my expectations to great lengths !	1
I agree with the other reviewers , max range is probably 10 feet . Other than that very high marks , easy to pair , charge , and use , and as long as you 're close the sound quality is great . Plantronics makes a great product .	1
This is a good inexpensive Bluetooth headset . I have used it in all types of conditions , walking in noisy urban areas , driving , etc . I can hear the people I am speaking with and they can hear me.The only reason I did not give it the 5th star is that it is touchy when trying to voice dial . You have to be in a very quiet environment to voice dial with this headset.I would recommend this product . You ca n't beat it for the price .	1
Plantronics makes the best bluetooth headsets you can get for the cost . No contest . I have made the mistake of purchasing Jawbone , Sennheiser , BlueParrot , Motorolla , Blue Trek , and god only knows which others . Plantronics is the only brand I 've purchased more than 1 of . While many of these brands cost well over 4 to 5 times what this one does , none of them can compare on battery life , consistency of connection , or all around value . This headset does take some getting used to as the rubber boot on it slightly penetrates your ear , but after a few days you will forget you are wearing it . The only headset I 've found that was easier to hear was the sennheiser , but it likes to stop communicating with your phone til you re-pair it and costs about 6 times what this does.Background noise suppression is stereotypical , if there 's noise , the person on the other end will most likely hear some translation of it . The mic is not as sensitive as those found in the Jawbone , so doing something productive like washing dishes wo n't blow out the eardrum of whoever you are speaking with , but they will hear some level of noise ( the Jawbone is brutally painful for that ! ) . I think this is the 5th or maybe 6th plantronics I 've bought , and I 'm sure it wo n't be the last.On a side note , the battery , under constant daily use , should last you approximately 500 charges , or 1.5 years avg . This is typical for any and all bluetooth headsets . At a cost of less than $ 20 , that means this unit will cost you barely $ 1 per month , as opposed to $ 10-15 per month for some of the designer headsets !	1
I have had this headset for a few years and it has been sitting in a box for about a year . Just pulled it out and paired it with my Droid X and it works fine . It was easy to pair and the sound is good . I have no problem with the comfort , since I only use it occasionally . Good inexpensive headset . I have owned 3 Plantronics headsets and I liked all of them . If I were buying a new headset I would probably get the 520 .	1
Picked this up when it was on sale and I must admit that it works great . Fits well and stays put . Sound is crisp . I 've received no complaints from people on the other end of the call . The battery holds up well . And it 's easy to use . Used with an iPhone and Blackberry with no issues.Update : This headset has lastest quite a while with a lot of use . I sit on daily conferences , and this is always in my ear during the conferences . It 's comfortable and lightweight . The sound is still great ( on both ends ) . And no issues with durability !	1
The Explorer 350 is simple to set up and use . Here 's my lowdown : Positive : - easy set up and use- good sound- balances well on the ear and easy to put on- nice options charging in car or via a USB port- nice options for mounting it in the car- nice phone ringing tone in the earpieceNegatives : - no built-in mute function ( that I can find ) - if you want to recharge via outlet , you have to purchase a chargerThis is my second Plantronics bluetooth headset . The first ( Voyager ) had all the bells as whistles , but the buttons were very small and the volume button broke when I dropped it on a tile floor . This one is easier to adjust on the fly but you have to be willing to live with no mute .	1
I go for comfort when it comes to headsets . The Plantronics headset is the most comfortable headset I 've ever owned , and I will always buy Plantronics . I got this one for my sister she loves it too . I 'm getting ready to buy a Plantronics Pro Plus headset , and use my old Plantronics as a back-up .	1
When I bought my first Bluetooth-enabled phone about 3 years ago the deal included a Motorola Bluetooth headset . Cool , I thought . Then I used it less and less , because the thing had to be recharged at home and would only last about an hour . Soon I thought it was just too hard to use ... hard to put on , and totally weird in that to turn it on you had to take it OFF your ear , flip down the mouthpiece , then put it BACK on your ear . Whoever designed the thing had no clue how people use headsets . It also sounded like I was talking from the bottom of a water well . Whenever I used it on conference calls people would yell for me to go on mute . So I started asking people in the waiting rooms at airports what brand they had and what brand they liked . I got so many people who hated Jabra that I did n't even consider it . I already did n't really care for Motorola , so I started looking at Nokia , which seem to be nice but clumsy , and then I kept meeting more and more people who were in love with their Plantronics . I have used Plantronics headsets for a long time in the office , after all , that 's all they do and they seem to do it well . I looked at a few Plantronics and did n't find one that jumped out at me , then one day I ran across the Explorer 350 . This was just too good to be true ! Are you kidding me , $ 49 bucks for a Bluetooth headset made by the top brand ? Then I looked closer and found that Plantronics did something very unique with this headset . Instead of having to charge it at home , it comes with an extremely cool little clip that either mounts to your dash or hooks to your air vent in your car then plugs into your cigarette lighter . Now that made sense ! A place to hold the headset where you use it most , always charging , then ready to use in a second or to walk around the rest of the day with it fully charged . For us road warriors , Plantronics also thoughtfully included a USB charging cable so the trusty laptop will keep your headset charged while you sleep . You can buy an optional AC adapter if that makes you feel more secure . So how is it built and how does it perform ? Built like a Hummer ! The main piece is one solid chunk that looks like it is pretty immune to any normal damage while clunking around in your pocket with a lot of coins . The piece that goes around your ear looks like it is solid as well , and effortlessly switches from ear to ear and slips on with one easy motion . After the first time , this thing slips on with no thought on my part and instantly is in the perfect position for use . Operation could n't be simpler . Unlike my Motorola with several switches that you had to remember how and what sequence to push them in , the Plantronics has one switch . Push it in to turn it on , push it in to turn it off , push it in to talk , push it in to hang up , push it in to voice dial , etc . All you have to do is push . Want to make it louder or quieter ? Push up or push down . No-brainer . I saved performance for last because this is what convinced me to keep it . After a quick charge I called a friend from my car with the window rolled down . This is a friend I talk to all the time from my land line . I said , hey , I just bought a new Bluetooth headset and want to see how it sounds to you . He said , cool , put it on and I 'll let you know . I said ... I already have it on ! He said the sound was perfect , no background noise of any kind and it sounded at least as good as my landline . One of the things several of my airport buddies told me they liked about Plantronics is how the durable rubber earpiece fits comfortably inside your ear and blocks out noise ... like annoying flight announcements . I have to say that not only did I sound perfect to my friend but every call I have been on has been easier to hear than with any other headset I have ever tried.PROS : Sound QualitySuperior constructionEase of usePairing - instant and flawlessPriceComfortCONS : None I could see . Earns a comfortable 5 stars !	1
Very nice bluetooth , a little bit big for my taste , but very solid feeling and does the job . Very good sound , fits nicely on my ear , and I love the car charger . Other than the slightly large size and look of it , its a great headset !	1
Of all the various brands of bluetooth headsets I 've purchased , all of the Plantronics products seem to offer the best value for the dollar . I have purchased other headsets from Sennheiser , BlueAnt , Trek , Jawbone , Pioneer , Sony , Motorola , and god knows who else . Plantronics has been the ONLY brand that I 've been a repeat customer of . I 've gotten the same sound quality out of this $ 20something headset as I did from the $ 140+ Jawbone and $ 160+ Sennheiser ! My advice , simple , order this or any Plantronics headset , take the change and get some new games or apps on that fancy Android handset ...	1
I have never been up with technology . My friend always had music on his phone and was listening to it all the time . I wanted to do the same . Going into this not sure I came out very pleased . I have a M520 phone and I listen to music all the time now . It has loud speakers and eliminates background noises . I have n't quite figured out how to answer the calls because when I hit the button on he headphones my phone freezes up . I really enjoy them .	1
After reading the reviews on this product , I was n't sure what to expect because the reviews were so varied in their complaints.The key things I 've noted after several weeks of use:1 ) The blinking blue light is n't any more noticeable or obnoxious than any other Bluetooth headset I 've used . Meaning , it 's bright and somewhat annoying , but fairly normal , better than some in fact . The only way I could see it being a problem is in a small space at night . Say a car . But if you 're driving with both ears covered , you 've got more problems than blinking blue lights.2 ) The sound quality is better than 90 % of the Bluetooth headsets I 've tried . Way better than Jabra or Motorola . From a call perspective , it 's about the same , but as a stereo headset , it 's so much better . I can listen to opera and hear the high and low vocals without distortion , which was impossible on the last Jabra I had.3 ) It requires a pairing code ! ! ! This is important to note . You ca n't pair it with a device that does n't allow you to enter a code ! So , it wo n't work with an off-the-shelf 3.5 or 2.5mm adapter . It pairs fine with my computer with built-in Bluetooth , and one of my cell phones because I can enter the code . It does not work with the Bluetooth dongle I bought for my MP3 player because no way to enter a pairing code . Also does n't work with the USB Bluetooth radio I bought for my other PC . This I found annoying and was the chief reason I dropped a star from the rating . One way around this is to buy the 590A model , rather than the 590E model ( the model I 'm reviewing ) because it comes with a paired adapter . However , the cost is much higher.4 ) Yes , as others have noted , this headset is made of hard plastic . The more flexible material many of us are used to in headphones is completely absent here . So , if you sit on them , as one user mentioned , you will break them . So do n't sit on them . They 're not tiny , so they 're hardly unobtrusive.5 ) They are the rare over-the-head headphones . Most Bluetooth these days are behind the neck . I like behind the neck styles , but with very long hair , they 're not the best option in the world . These stay on and are comfortable through several hours of wear , and have n't pulled out a single hair yet . My Jabra headphones ripped hair out constantly.6 ) The controls are mostly nice . I like that they 're all on one ear . Some other sets have the controls spread out over the two ear phones , which I find annoying . The one thing I do n't like in the controls is that I naturally think of volume as UP DOWN and tracks as BACK FORWARD . The controls are the complete opposite , which is odd to me . The UP button is track forward , the DOWN button is track back . The FORWARD button is volume up and the BACK button is volume down . I do n't know who thought of that of that bit of engineering , but it should n't have made it out of the drawing room.Overall , I 'm very happy with these headphones , there are some minor annoyances , but that can be said for every Bluetooth headphone on the market . The most important thing to me was that the sound quality be good for music play . I have many headsets for phone calls , but this was the first one that had nice music quality . I just wish it worked with a standard Bluetooth adapter . Perhaps next time .	1
These headphones are absolutely great . The sound quality is clean and accurate . Hooking up to my bluetooth music player/cellphone was quick and easy . They are comfortable to wear . Switching between music and phone function is simple . Controls are easy to use and can be adjusted without having to remove the headphones from your head . The batteries keep a charge for a long time , and recharging is easy . Now here 's the super annoying part . When listening to music , the headphones have a bright blue light that flashes constantly to indicate that there is a bluetooth connection . I tried to listen to music as I fell asleep . My wife snapped `` Turn those things off , that light is going to give me a seizure ! '' Even if I am sitting in a room by myself , the light is annoying . I like to listen to music in a dimly lit room . I can see the flashing light while I am wearing the headphones , and it is totally distracting . My head looks like a safety beacon at the airport . There is no way to turn the light off . I did try going to bed wearing the headphones with a sock over the earpiece . That sort of worked , but what a ridiculous thing to have to do . If you think that this flashing light thing will bother you , steer clear . If not , then do n't hesitate to buy them , they work great .	1
I have tried way too many bluetooth headsets ( Motorola , Plantronics , IO Gear , Logitech , Jabra ) and found most to be disappointing . IMHO , the Scala 700 right now is the best bang for the buck . This is my second product from Cardo Scala - the first being the 500 , which was also a great headset . The 500 had great sound on both ends and was more than loud enough . Most other headsets suffer from earpiece volume that is just not loud enough . Also the lack of noise cancellation and wind noise reduction on the other headsets made them only useful in the office or a quiet car . The Scala 700 windguard technology is not perfect - but performs much better than anything else I have tried . The 700 is about 1/3 smaller than the 500 and performs just as well in every aspect . The buttons and controls are easy to use and intuitive . It takes a little tweaking to adjust the headset for a comfortable fit , but after some bending and shaping of the earpiece , the headset was very stable and comfortable . For the price , this is a very good option .	1
Better wind noise control than Jawbone , and Plantronics 510.Stays connected with Razer . Others don't.Background music a problem . Jawbone better when backgroung gets rough.The Boom best of all but so far no bluetooth . [ ... ] Bites ear after awhile.Good transmit and recieve audio . Almost as good as 510 in audio response.For less than $ 40 -- -Good buy .	1
I bought this for my Treo 650 and so far I 'm very impressed . Battery life is great ( about 10 hours ) , charges very quickly , and it 's literally so light you forget you 're wearing it . I also appreciate the addition of a PC USB charge cable for travelling lighter . Very nice addition for this price.I 've only had it for a week and it is holding up well ( you get a padded velcro carrying case too ) but my initial impression , to be honest , was that it seemed a little too fragile - again it 's very small and light . So I 've been skeptical but we 'll see how it goes and if I have to return it I 'll modify my review.Pairing it up with the Treo 650 was fast and simple . It rings about 1 second after the phone rings also . The volume control on the unit is easy to use and can be turned up very loud . No complaints on the sound quality from anyone - my wife says it sounds a little like I 'm on speakerphone but it 's clear and understandable.Update : I had a chance to hear my wife using the headset finally and I 'm very impressed - I think this headset is a keeper . There 's virtually no background noise . I could n't even tell that she was driving in the car . Absolutely amazing background noise cancellation.Update # 2 : This battery lasts forever - very impressed - and you really forget you 're wearing this thing - it 's that small and light !	1
I 've tried both the Motorola HS810 and the Treo bluetooth headsets , and this by far is the best one . The problem with Motorola is that it does n't synch with the Treo 650 100 % of the time ; while the Treo headset has very poor volume ( I need to be in a quiet room to hear anything ) . The Cardo Scala 700 has great fit ( it sits right over the ear canal ) , great volume ( even when driving with windows down ) , and it synchs with the Treo 650 all the time . This is the headset I 'd recommend for anyone with the Treo 650 .	1
I was concerned after ordering this device , when I read many reviews that said this device was a cheap piece of plastic that did n't fit into their ear properly . When I opened the packaged and first put it in my ear , I thought `` oh no - they were right ! `` But I then read the manual and after adjusting the `` ear loop '' and angling the headset slightly downward , it fit perfectly into my ear ! It 's snug , it does n't flop around at all . It fits in a different way from your traditional `` ear plug '' device but in many ways it 's more comfortable because it 's not sitting in your outer ear canal but slightly further outside.So if you 're thinking about ordering this device , I 'd recommend buying it . Just spend a little time getting the fit right and read the manual about how to adjust the ear loop which makes a huge difference . ( Functionally the product paired with my Cingular Hermes 8525 phone perfectly - sound quality is fine ) .	1
Outstanding headset . Best I have ever used . Syncs perfectly with my Treo 650 . One press of the call button locks it onto my Treo for bluetooth operation . I even use a second one at home with my 5.8 ghz cordless phones and a BTA II scala bluetooth adapter .	1
I ca n't even begin to tell you the hell I 've been through with other BT headsets and the Treo 650 . They all had pairing issues - either they wo n't pair with the phone or they do n't stay paired . And the volume was not loud enough . I returned at least 5 headsets until I came across this one . The sound quality is maybe an 8 out of 10 but the volume is unbelievable , and this coming from a guy that does n't have the best hearing . I can actually hear the person on the line - all the time . Even in noisy environments . No complaints from people on the receiving end except when I 'm in the home and the mircowave oven is running ( this will scramble almost all BT frequencies ) . Buttons are placed well and they are very responsive.Initial pairing was a breeze and the 700 connects to my phone flawlessly on virtually every call . In the two weeks I 've owned it , I think it failed to connect on two occasions and I make well over 50 calls/day . This compares to the 75 % connect rate I realized with other BT headsets.Battery life is a 10 out of 10 . I charge the headset every day but I often talk 5-6 hours in one day without recharging . Just amazing ! They claim 10 hours ( which it may actually achieve ) but I 'm amazed it can actually make it past 5 hours.The range is not that great but I ca n't fault the headset as Treo is known to incorporate substandard BT electronics into their phones - which make the range very , very poor . Once in a while , if the phone is in my right pocket and headset in my left ear , there is a slight crackling noise . It 's not bad though , but can be annoying . Pulling it out of my pocket immediately relieves the problem.Whatever you do , do n't attempt to test the buzzer feature when the headset is in your ear - the buzzing is LOUD when it 's placed right in the ear . But if you needed to find it if lost in the room , be prepared to make the room very quiet to locate it . It relies on the internal speaker to create the buzzing sound.Nice to have TWO chargers available in the retail packaging ( one standard wall outlet adapter and one USB charger ) . The carrying case was useless but a nice add nonetheless.I would recommend this to anyone with a Treo 650 . I 'm not sure if this headset will rate as well with other phones but I can guarantee you wo n't find a better BT headset for the 650 .	1
I can talk for over 5 continuous hours on this headset ( never tried longer ) . However , my Motorola HS820 is more comfortable AND my callers understand me better . I get many complaints with the Scala 700 that my voice is n't clear or our connection is bad . In addition , when I listen to mp3 files , the HS820 has a warmer sound . The Scala 700 has a 'tinty ' sound.The Scala 700 comes with a proprietary usb and a case . Nice .	1
I purchased these for my laptop which has a defective headphone jack & for use with my ipod 's bluetooth adapter ( wRevo A100 ) . After a software update to my laptop 's adapter I could not be happier with the purchase . As soon as I turn on my laptop , the headphones connect . The sound quality is great and I can easily walk 15-20 feet away with line of sight and not experience distortion . If I go into another room , there will be a drop off , but it reconnects once line of sight is re-established.With the ipod bluetooth adapter , all of the features work : volume control , play/pause & song forward/backward . Worth noting that the forward/backward track function does not work with iTunes.They do get slightly uncomfortable after about 4 hours of straight wear , but after 15 minutes of rest , I 'm good to go for another several hours.I have not tried them as headset for my phone , because I do n't use them for that , so no review on the microphone.I would not use them for jogging or any exercise due to how that would feel bouncing on the ears , but they stay on really well as I mow the lawn and do other yard work for 2-3 hours .	1
When I found out my wife was pregnant , I instantly looked to acquire a set of headphones that I could use so as not to disturb the sleeping baby . I had already purchased theMotorola MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth Stereo Headphones , but those did n't work well when laying down , and they did n't do so great with blocking outside noises . I also had theSony MDR-RF925RK 900 MHz Analog RF Wireless Headphone , which were good at canceling outside noises , but produced so much static and whitenoise that they were useless.When I came across the S805 I went ahead and gave them a try . I 'm glad I did . First , note that I would never use these to make phone calls . They can , but they are so big and bulky that I would n't even try . Walking around the house with these giant beasts is n't my idea of a good bluetooth talking device . What I use them for is to watch movies/anime and play the PS3.They are hooked up to my Yamaha HTR-5640 Home Theater Receiver using aSony Bluetooth Transmitter and Adapter for iPod and MP3 Players . Unless your receiver has Bluetooth built in , you 'll need a transmitter . Just be sure it supports A2DP . I had theJabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor , but it did n't work with the S805 because it was n't A2DP compliant.Overall , I love the quality of the connection : no whitenoise , no static . There is the occasional dropped signal , but that 's easily and quickly restored . I purchased these in December of 2008 , and in March of 2011 they still work like a charm .	1
Overall , its a good set of headphones . Ive owned quite a few sets of bt headphones and by far i still dont think any are better than the Moto HT 820 setThe jog dials are good and handy , and they are comfy on the ears . they already send you the case with them too so dont buy it optional . They wont tell you this when ordering hoping that you will pitch them more money ... They are also a little on the large side . If you purchase you will get cracked on for looking like DJ Khaled ( Just giving heads up . the ht 820 's that moto makes are the best ive ever owned . above any.But for the money these a great fit ... .enjoy	1
I 've really enjoyed being able to listen to music wires-free . The padding on them makes them very comfortable , something my other headphones lack on the part that goes over the head . And it 's great to be able to control volume , pause/play , and skip through songs right from the headphones.The pairing has been a bit confusing for me , though . I 've had some trouble trying to get it into paring mode . It 's had to figure out what mode it 's in from the blinking light . I have n't been able to get it to pair with both my phone and my iPod 's adapter . Either one of those works , though.I have n't tested out the battery life in full , but it 's lasted through 2 hours without having a problem.It would also be nice to be able to use them while they are charging .	1
This is my first pair of Bluetooth headphones , and I opted for this style because I want a set of headphones for my phone that will truly deliver the music quality and sound that I 'm looking for , and I want that to come in a pair of headphones that feel like they 're worth the money I paid for them . These headphones easily fulfill both of these desires for me , and then some ! These Motorola headphones are NOT lightweight , but they also wo n't have you feeling overly weighed down , either . They 're simply solid-feeling in weight and construction . I read many other reviews of these online , one from an owner who has owned these headphones over the course of at least a year and a half , and who paid over $ 120.00 for his pair . Considering the price that I got these for ( comparable to the prices that I found for these here on Amazon ) , I feel like I got mine at a steal , at less than $ 40.00 ! These Motorola headphones FEEL like they 're worth $ 150.00 , and the stereo sound that comes from them is great . The sound is crisp , clear , and has plenty of depth to it for my taste . I did n't find these headphones to be lacking in their production of bass . No , the bass in these IS N'T going to blow your eardrums out , but I like to have all of the sound elements enhance the overall effect of the music , not overpower it.As far as taking calls on these go , there is no obvious microphone on these , but they work great , just the same . My callers had no problems whatsoever hearing me on these , and I could hear them beautifully on them as well . I was told that the audio being received from these was loud , crisp , and clear , and the same seemed to be the case for me as well on the other end of the calls . I 've also had no trouble using the operational buttons , and my phone found and paired with these headphones easily . The only thing that I did n't remember when I ordered these , though ( completely my own fault ) , is that I wo n't be able to wear these to take calls while I 'm driving , as traffic laws dictate that both ears can not be covered and obstruct vital traffic sounds . Oh well . My bad.Overall , I am SO thrilled with these headphones . I always found the single-ear Bluetooth headsets to look a little ridiculous , so I was all too eager to get a stereo set of Bluetooth headphones that did n't look odd or awkward . These headphones ARE large , but they 're solidly made , and look like an expensive , high quality piece of audio equipment . I love them , and would buy them again in a heartbeat .	1
I plugged it in and it worked . It works every time . A great buy and the quality is good .	1
I purchased the mobile charger to use it while navigating with the GPS assistance on my E71 , I must say it works great , and it has been a great thing to have in over 2 hour trips , since the battery does get drained .	1
bought for my Nokia E71 well over a year ago and it still works great ! ! ! Much cheaper than buying one at retail store and this one works just as good ! ! would defiantly recommend to others ! !	1
Reliable , original retail accessory shipped promptly.Indicator light and large ( long ) tip . Perfect for my Nokia phone and headset .	1
THis charger arrived promptly and it works as advertised ! The DC-4 is a rapid charger so ur battery will heat up a bit but nothing to worry about ! Also , the charger is a snug fit , but not as tight as another reviewer reported , maybe they had a defective unit ? . Mine fit nicely with no bfroken parts . Very recommended !	1
This Nokia DC-4 Mobile Charger fits the Nokia E63 . The charging time is normal rather than quick ( such as when using a quick charger ) . The construction is average . If you prefer using an OEM charger in the car then this is it .	1
This charger works perfectly with my N810 . I had purchased from another location a charger that was supposed to work and it did except that the contact seemed intermittent . This one charges the device perfectly .	1
It 's simply working fine . What do you expect from a car charger ? It 's robust and well-made .	1
What can you say . It 's a genuine Nokia car charger . It 's high quality . It 's cheap , and it works . Bought one for myself . Bought one for my girlfriend . Bought another one for my girlfriend when her rabbit chewed up the first one . They all worked great.A friend of mine bought some no-name brand from a big box store . Paid more and it does n't work as well . The no-name crapper charges so slow you 'd have to drive around all day to charge your phone . If you are using the GPS feature while plugged into that one your battery still gets drained.No such problems with the Nokia DC-4 . It charges fast , and will continue to charge even when using power hungry applications.EDIT : Note that this 2mm coax style charger will charge your device faster than the DC-6 Micro USB version ( 890 mAh vs. 500 ) .	1
This is the Nokia OEM car charger . Better than ANY off-brand charger.It charges your Nokia phone in the car.For the money you ca n't go wrong .	1
Be careful , this is a high output charger , so battery charges quickly , but also heats up . The charger is solidly built , no rattles and feels like it can survive repeated plugging and unplugging . There is a bright , easy to see LED so you know it is plugged in properly .	1
Works very well , and the price was right . Have used it a great deal to charge phone on trips ; nice unit .	1
I needed this device for my iPhone . Keep it in the glove box for emergencies . It is rather hard to seat in the cigarette lighter receptacle in my Lincoln Town Car , but after a lot of fussing , I am able to get it connected and working . Not the best design , but since it 's only used in case of an emergency , it 's fine . The price was right .	1
It is worth to use it . However , I do n't like my cell to be out of power during traveling : )	1
Good charger . Works well . Very helpful if you use the A-GPS on your phone ( which eats battery life pretty quickly ) .	1
Arrived in a retail package , appeared to be genuine Nokia . This has to be stuffed in the lighter receptacle because of an excessively tight fit . My concern was that it would ruin the receptacle , but so far other plugs ( Belkin , Sprint , Sony ) still fit . Once connected it charges my 6126 just as it should .	1
For the money spent on it , it is a very good deal.It is useful in the car , when your mobile is on low battery . Of course , it does take some time to charge , but nevertheless , it is very useful .	1
Excelente ... me gusto mucho el adaptador Nokia DC-4 Cargador de m & oacute ; vil ... antes de comprarlo verifiquen si sus nokias funcionan con este cargador , ya que otros modelos requieren el DC-6 que la entrada es diferente ...	1
I brought this charges but never used it , so please before you judge or make any kind of decision please read other review to make a fair decision .	1
It works on my Nokia 5530 . Inexpensive , got 2 , one for each car for emergencies . These are original Nokia chargers in a retail box . Not some off brand knock off ( yes , everything is made in China these days - but these are the real McCoy ) ... ...	1
My wife has had it for over three years and it is still working . It is a great phone !	1
I 'm a long-running Virgin customer , but additionally I work as a developer in the mobile industry , and so I 've had experience using literally scores of handsets from every imaginable carrier ( including non-US ) . Previous Virgin phones I 've used include the Vox 8610 and Kyocera 2255 . My 8610 still works , but it 's a bit bulky and heavy for my tastes and I decided to upgrade.Let 's start with the positives : -Very compact design . This is probably the cheapest phone of its size/capabilities available anywhere . It is so thin that when I put it in the same pocket as my wallet , I sometimes forget it 's there.-For the cost , it is pretty decent in terms of features . 128x128 screen with fullscreen graphic support , 10 MB for downloads ( 32 total ) , speakerphone , web capability , comparable performance to most Nokia series 40 devices . Very long battery life , and fast charging . For those that have had trouble with the battery I suggest you try turning off the backlight . It might have ... interesting ... effects.-Uses the Sprint network . I 've found this to be very reliable in my area , and signal quality is excellent both in and outdoors.-Call quality is good . Comparable to the 8610 as far as I can tell , which was also good ( my old Kyocera , on the other hand , was garbage ) .-UI has a solid , standard design . Predictive text included for messaging . The phone 's graphics are a bit odd , but not necessarily in a bad ways.-Durable . UTStarcom knows how to build to last . This handset is no exception.-Good library of games , ringtones , and graphics available . Now I actually have something to spend all that balance on ... -Virgin is a very low cost provider . It 's no good if you want video on demand , 3G , or whatnot . But for just making calls/texting now and then , you simply ca n't beat $ 20/3 months . No annual contract as well , which is a huge plus ( as many who 've had one know all too well ) .On the downside : -Keys are a bit small . This is typical of ultra-thin handsets . They are a bit stiff as well , which is good and bad ( good because you wo n't accidentally press them as easily , bad because typing is more of a pain ) .-Virgin 's web browser is lame . Their web service costs extra , and it has problems viewing many page formats ( says 'network gremlins ' when you try ... cute ) . You can browse basic html , and that 's about it- good luck reading e-mail with it.-No bluetooth built-in , though this is to be expected.-No camera either , also to be expected . This can actually be a good thing , since camera phones are off-limits in more areas than you might expect.Bottom line : this handset is great for the price . There are flaws with it , as with any phone , but the pluses outweigh the minuses . I 've seen many reviewers complain about both Virgin and the phone , but in my professional opinion ( and it is an expert opinion ) these people need to realize that you get what you pay for . This is n't a $ 200 Samsung T519 , and you 're not paying $ 60 a month for service on a 2 year contract . Considering the costs , the Slice is an great handset with excellent service , and that is that .	1
I love this device - it 's the only one that allows you to plug in your own headset . And I am VERY HAPPY to report that it works perfectly with the Verizon XV6800 Smartphone ( also known as the HTC 6800 or Mogul 6800 on Sprint ) . No one reviewing here had tried it with this device , but I wanted the functionality so I took a chance and ordered it anyway . It works perfectly ! ( Or what I 've tried so far works perfectly - I have n't received any phone calls while listening to music yet . ) Note that I 'm running Windows Mobile 6.1 . I think it may not work for devices running WM 6.0 . The audio jack functionality was altered with the OS upgrade . It may work , though - ca n't say for sure . It 's worth trying !	1
I bought this primarily for the headphones rather than the hands free aspect , so this relates to the headphones . They sound much better than I had anticipated , and I would recommend this for anyone with a compatable LG phone.I used the hands free a couple of times and it works reasonably well , but does pick up enough outside wind noise to make it not practical on moderately to very windy days .	1
mine did n't come with the earbuds for some reason , but i was n't going to use them anyway . however , the adapter is WELL worth the money and works perfectly with my LG chocolate . i highly recommend one of these for anybody that wants to listen to music on their cell phone but does n't want to pay a bunch to do so .	1
The quality of the headphones is not top noch , but what can you expect for less than $ 10 including shipping ? The functionality is great and I love that it is a two piece unit , allowing you to connect your own quality headphones . I actually love these headphones for talking in noisy rooms . Very easy to hear the person on the other line .	1
my mom loved them not so much the color but she quickly got over it when she realized how good they perform - when i talk to her on the phone she sounds super clear and loud i sometimes tell her to speak lower - these can easily be the best ones out there for the price and performance I am really glad I got them based on the reviews on here so it would only be fair to put my 2 cents in thanks a lot	1
I purchased an LG Env3 and I wanted to stay within the LG products category since they made me such an awesome cell phone and TV . So I did a search for LG stereo headset after I realized my phone did mp3 music and this headset popped up first . And it showed up first in my search because it deserves to be recognized . I love this headset . Even with the stock headphones that come with it I have good loud stereo phone calls and music . And no , the audio quality with the standard headset is not spectacular , but LG knew that and made it to where you can use your favorite headphones with your cell phone for music . I owned a Samsung stereo headset to match my SCH-U740 and it did not offer stereo phone calls . So here are my Pros and Cons for the product as it stands having owned them for 5 months.Pros : +Provides stereo phone calls and music+Goes as loud as you 'd like and then some . I could n't hear one of my friend 's on my Jabra BT8040 but I heard him loud and in stereo with this headset+Volume knob on the silver microphone piece for changing the volume on the fly+Price is awesome compared to a bluetooth stereo headset+Reduces drain on your phone battery by keeping bluetooth signal broadcast off+Call button allows you to call the last number ( press once ) , say a voice command ( hold button ) , or hang up the call ( press once again ) with my Env3+Designed to work with any set of 3.5mm headphones+Has a spring tension clip allowing you to clip it to your clothing or to your seatbelt+Worked as a hands-free calling device through the stereo and speakers in my car ! ( Details below ) +Lightweight . Could be used for running with the right headphones . I did not test this myself though+I can run it underneath my shirt and clip it to my collar to hide the wire . The wire from the 2.5mm end to the control part looks to be about 2 feet long+No complaints about sound quality no matter where I placed it to talk . Including under my sheets and comforter when I went to bedCons ( of course ) -Low quality headphone included for mp3 playback-The center control is where the weight is so if it is n't clipped to you and you lean over it will pull on the headphones-Does not have wind reduction properties so windy environments may interrupt conversation-The cord from the 2.5mm end to the silver control section is quite long not including added headphone length . Keeping it discrete outside of clothing would prove difficult-Only way to mute a call is to mute it on the phone . Can not mute the headset microphoneThe cons all have to do with the individual . I love this headset more than any bluetooth I 've ever bought . And I was going to tell you a story about the hands-free headset in my car . Well , I have one of those tape to 3.5mm headphone jack adapters that works in cars with tape players . I was on the road and I did n't want the headphones in so I plugged the 3.5mm adapter end into the headset , inserted the tape , turned up the volume , and made a call . It worked perfectly ! I was able to turn the volume up on the radio and listen to the call through all of my speakers . The person on the other end told me that the sound was great until the volume in the car was up so loud that his voice was echoing back into the microphone . But the best part was that the headset was n't clipped to me , it was in the passengers seat and I was having a conversation without the person asking if something was different . My next project will be seeing if my radio broadcasting adapter will broadcast my call through my stereo just as well . I 'll try to remember to update when I know for sure . Trust me , if you 're not hung up on being ahead of the technological curve with stereo bluetooth this headset will impress you without a doubt . Definitely one of the best purchases I will ever make and I can highly recommend it !	1
I have n't used it much but when I have , it works as advertized . The different length cords to the earbuds do n't bother me . I have many sets that are like that .	1
Works fine to charge my 4S or Pad 2 . Bulky and not very aesthetic , but ca n't expect anything different for the price . Happy with it .	1
Exactly as promised , I use this at home and work with no glitches at all . Would recommend for others to purchase .	1
Works well . I like that the electric prongs do not collaspe since that is where I have had problems in past . We buy in bulk for company iphones and this item is cheap and does the job .	1
Charges the iPhone3Gs and iPhone4 just fine . For the price it 's well worth it . The wire is very short though . Also it 's bulky head may not work with all cases .	1
For a little over $ 2 , I can find no faults with this charger . I bought two of them for our iPhones , have used them on a few dozen long trips , and they still work perfectly fine .	1
This travel charger for the iPhone fits my iPhone 4 just fine , charges just fine , and it 's sturdy . I see know problems with this item .	1
Sturdy case , and fits the Samsung Note 2 very well . Gives me a belt clip which I prefer and kick stand ( very hard to open ) on the part that holds the phone . My biggest concern is that the corners do n't seem to be covered but I notice this one most hard shell covers.Other than those minor issues , it works well to provide protection for the Note 2.Andre	1
The holster/case offers nice protection for the large screen Galaxy Note 2 . The kickstand is a little flimsy , as my phone was standing on the kickstand it fell off the table to the hard floor right onto its face on Day 1 . I just knew the screen would be broken , but it was n't . So the holster provided GREAT protection !	1
I was very worried after all the bad reviews , however they said they had re-desighned it so i took a chance , the first one i received had a large crack in it , because of how it was packaged so i ended up returning it and ordering it again , next one came in a box and was good . i am very pleased with this , i ordered one for the same price and same style from a different brand and between the two i like this one better.- very thin slim style does not ad bulk to it- other brand was the same-the belt clip is much stronger looking then the other brand , now i will say if you need a super strong clip this may not be for you , but it is stronger then other brand i ordered-one feature this one has the other does not is the clip is on one side of the case and the stand is one the other so if you do n't want to have the holster part on you can use the stand if you want but is pushed in so you do n't have to , the other brand was built into the holster clip and scince phone faces in seems kinda useless to me . how strong this is ? ? i have not had a problem but i would be carefull . i also have a otter box , i will say i like this one much better because i do n't need that super strong thick bulky type of case , i like to switch my cases out to colors to suit my mood , and need . so for this kind of use i love it i can take it to the gym and clip it on my shirt or pants or whatever with no problam and if i want to use the stand while playing on it works good , the make of it is a higher end looking then the other one i got , i like them both but prefer this one , but as i said if you need a super strong case this may not be for you but for protection in your purse or car and a basic use case it is good . i will buy it again .	1
May not be for everyone , but I like it . The case is very solid . The screen is well protected while leaving ample openings for on/off , volume , camera , speaker , S pen , earphone , and microUSB port . Heeding the warning from other users that the beltclip breaks off readily , I intentionally broke it off : ) and put the rest of the holder/phone in my cargo pants . Not real fast getting the phone out , but with bluetooth so ubiquitous these days , there 's less need for speed . The built-in stand is a little unstable in the 'portrait ' position , but works fine in the 'landscape ' position . It also works well with a dash ( GPS ) holder : i.Trek ME-USDM Universal Dashboard Mount , also from Amazon .	1
I 've found that these are by far the best method for clipping my phone to my belt , I 've used others many more expensive but always come back to one of these because of their built in kickstand and ability to easily and quickly slide the phone out.They 're cheap yes but I 've never had any problems with durability except after a long time of use , much longer you would expect such a cheap piece of plastic to last , that and on the ones with the kickstands like this that locking mechanism eventually wears out but the whole thing is easily replaceable.I have at times knocked the phone out my holster when bumping up against something but that is the tradeoff you pay for not having a lock obstructing your access to the device .	1
I got a similar case for my Galaxy S3 . Great and useful case . So I got this one for my Galaxy Note 2.Note : this case is not meant to protect your device from falls , etc . -- it 's no Otterbox or rubber bumper case . In my case , I did n't want a thick protective case because all of them add significant bulk to the phone . I carry my phone wherever I go and use it in the case on a windshield mount . With thick cases , I need a bigger windshield mount ( or I need to remove the phone from the case -- a big inconvenience ) -- with this slim case , the phone fits on the windshield mount while in the case.Removing the Note 2 from this case takes a little effort but you get better at it with practice.The kickstand is very useful for watching videos and/or reading at the table while having coffee or eating , etc . It 's also useful when ussing an external ( bluetooth ) keyboard.One downside , the case makes it such that the buttons ( power and volume up/down ) take some effort to & # 34 ; find & # 34 ; without looking . I need to be able to quickly whip out my phone at a moment 's notice without looking at it . The case as it is , makes it so that finding those buttons requires a little more effort than without the case and/or actually looking at the sides of the phone . This flaw is NOT entirely the fault of the case -- I never had this problem with the S3 version of this case . The reason is that the buttons on the Note 2 are slightly more forward so they blend in a lot more with the edge of the case.My solution : I used a small wire cutter to clip off the edged of the case where it connects the openings for where the buttons are . This did not affect ( at least in any discernible way ) the structural integrity of the case as the case is pretty stiff . Also , I clipped of the edges to they were nice and smooth and looked like that 's how the case was made . Now , I can easily & # 34 ; find & # 34 ; the buttons and use the phone as quickly and effectively as without the case.I would absolutely buy this again and on my next phone , I look forward to getting another .	1
Same as you pay more for in a Verizon Store . But in Verizon store you ca n't get belt clip for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 .	1
I purchased two on different occasions for two phones.The old design feels bulky but the feel has a bit more rubberized grip.The design is sleeker but does not have the same grip , i feel like I am going to drop it because it feels slippery.We have not had problems with the clip its doing its job thus far	1
This is a well build carrying case that should last a while.It is a eye catcher with the design and it allows your phone to breath and not get over heated like some cases.The belt clip is build well , very solid and also turns 360 degree so it can be positioned in any direction.This is a exact fit for the note 2 and is worth the time .	1
When I was going to purchase this phone , I knew I would need a holster to use it practically . On my previous phone , DROID 3 , I also had a holster , which I liked very much . I never grew fond of the idea of putting the phone in my pocket.I bought my holster on 4/26/13 and , despite the many negative reviews , I am pretty sure I have bought the new and improved design . I 've had the holster for a little over 2 months at the time of this writing and it 's holding up very well . The kickstand is strong , does not feel weak or flimsy , when placing the GN2 inside the case , it snaps in very firmly . as in , you would need like a plastic pry tool to get it out again , and when placing the GN2 into the holster , it fits just fine.So far , there is no dis-colorization ( i have the white edition to match the housing of my GN2 ) , the criss-cross pattern is n't fading away , the belt clip is strong and sturdy . I use the belt clip everyday and there are no hints or anything telling me it 's going to break any time soon . When the belt clip is in place , it stays there.As stated throughout my review , I do n't see any abnormalities by this product . If I managed to break it myself , I would buy again as a replacement .	1
Fit and function are just great . Kickstand is a big plus . Form is tight and all the cut outs are very neat .	1
I like this product a lot I wish it came in green or just other colors in general very satisfied	1
I just received the case earlier today and I put it on my Galaxy Note 2 and it fist like a glove , the case does feel like it was very well made . Time will tell if the improvements the maker made will keep the belt clip from breaking as the earlier versions of the case did , I will put the case to the test , But so far I am happy with the case .	1
The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is because if you do not have it in the case face first , it does not provide any screen protection like you can get with an otter box with the outer edge . However , I love the clip and the fact that it doubles as a stand . I have used this several times while watching a video on YouTube or a movie trailer . All in all , it 's a great case .	1
It 's a nice protective , attractive , rugged case except for the belt clip and the fold out stand . The fold out stand is flimsy and the clip it self snaps off causing the phone to drop to the floor . It has happened twice so far and luckily it was a carpeted floor , no damage to phone . The problem has now caused me to be very careful when using the belt clip .	1
The most secure way to exercise and listen to your music or news . Belt clip is sturdy and strong and the holster fits and holds the phone .	1
Looks as it does in the picture ! The holster fits perfect on my waist and holds my phone well ! I love it !	1
Nice . Well constructed . Soft lining will not scratch screen.Reversible . Can use with Screen facing in or out depending upon use.As belt clip rotates can install upside down and phone falls out.No stand .	1
Looks great , feels great on my phone ! I get compliments on it ! Now the only thing about the holster case is that it does not actually grasp the phone , so even though this is a swivel holster , it would be bad to rotate it 180 degree from the upward position . The good news is , I barely have rotated while it was on my person . ALSO I was a great set of anti-glare screen protectors from the company FREE ! so it was awesome . : )	1
It 's a good two in one protector , only gripe is that it becomes a pain taking it out of the holster , especially when it 's on your belt . Other than that great device . It does n't interfere when your texting as most cases do with the lip on the sides of the phone .	1
Works great . Phone fits in well , nothing is blocked by the case . Fitment is perfect . Have dropped the phone a few times and the case took the damage fine . Love the stand . I keep my phone in the case and just slide it into the holster when needed.I love cases like these and will keep ordering them for any phone I have .	1
Great product my husband love it ! ! safe clip helps for his work , covers really well the phone and the elegant black fits with all styles . simply love it ! !	1
It seems that , to date , no one has really created a durable holster for the Note 2 , but this one is the best so far . The new lip at the bottom of the unit keeps the phone from falling out while holstered ( Yup , other designs have had that problem ) . The belt clip seems more durable as well . I 've owned at least a few different designs of Note 2 holsters now , and I 've broken them all by simple actions like accidentally catching the unit on a door jam.This unit has held up better in the past week or so that I 've had it ( Yup , broke 'm in less than a week prior ) . It 's easier to retrieve the phone with the sleek design than some other bulkier , soft-rubber cases . I like it so far .	1
I received my case for my phone , and I am very pleased with it . I got a great product at a low , low price !	1
This case is the BEST . I have used it now for about a month . I love that the screen side of the phone is protected . I can toss in my purse and not worry that the screen will get damaged . I use the belt clip while at work and it has performed flawlessly . ( The clip does pop off if you do not want to use it . ) I have use the clip as a stand . This feature is very nice . Recently was addressing cards and found it very convenient to use the stand and move thru my address book.Very HAPPY with my purchase ! ! !	1
Nice sturdy case . I use this primarily to click onto my shorts when walking . It stays put and I feel my phone is safe in this case . This case fits my Note II perfectly.I would recommend this case .	1
I absolutely LOVE this case . It is the best one I 've had for my Galaxy Note II . It is very low profile and provides a reasonable amount of protection . The holster is sturdy and holds the phone well . Thank you for such a great product !	1
The BoxWave Dual + Holster for Samsung Note 2 worked perfectly . This is the second BoxWave product I 've purchased and there quality is very good .	1
The color , feel , and has a strong hold to my phone . The kick stand is very nice as well . Easy to install and very easy to remove the phone from the clip .	1
The product came on time , and the cost was very affordable.I got so many compliments on it , because of the design , very happy .	1
This case works well and looks great . The clip broke off but with a little super glue it was good as new . My husband loves his case .	1
This is a real strong rugged case its awesome I would recommend this to anyone who does alot of outside work this is real strong	1
The picture of this item is misleading , the picture makes it look grey and opaque but in reality it is actually transparent on the sides and white and opaque on the bottom . The case itself is very good , although after use the plastic turns yellowish .	1
I bought the Artic Red Frost for Nexus 4. i love the material of this case that makes it strong to hold the phone ( hard rubber-type material ) the case also covers some parts of the bezel -- enough to not damage the screen when laid on its screen . all of the cut-outs are aligned perfectly . two cons for me was it is hard to press the power button & it does n't have a good grip . Although it was more ease to press the volume buttons , i had to apply more pressure against the power button . Maybe it is a mistake in creating . With about a week , i kind of got used to it , so it did not bother me much to always notice it . Because of the somewhat slippery back , it sorta makes the hold slippery . While i am speaking of the back , the back makes the phone looks awesome . It is transparent and i can clearly read 'nexus ' & 'LG ' from the back . it gives the phone a good look . The grip , is not a severe issue , but the level of grip is just less than my other case by GreatShield . I just want to put that out there for other consumers to consider . Another thing i 'll add is that it looks pretty cool in sunlight . I can see part of the actual phone through the case while the sunlight makes mostly the edges of the case glisten . To conclude , i will be sticking with this case because of the look , protection , and decent grip .	1
It 's a slip on case that looks good and protects the phone from light drops onto the desk . Just thick enough to keep the lens glass and the display glass from touching when laying the phone down . I also love the diamond patterned grips on the sides of the phone - makes grabbing it on the run real easy , no slipping . For the money , it 's a good buy if you 're looking to keep the phone in your pocket without adding a lot of bulk .	1
Excellent TPU case . Looks great , slim , improves grip , protects the phone from drops on concrete . What more is there to say ?	1
I purchased this case from my girlfriend and her new Samsung Galaxy S4 . She had been using an Otterbox Commuter but was dissatisfied with that case 's bulk . I 'm a big fan of TPU cases , so I got her this one and she could n't be happier with it . It fits snugly , looks great , covers the buttons ( big plus ) , and is n't so bulky . While this case is not at all bulky , it still offers protection for the camera lens and screen by having tiny ridges surrounding those parts which keep them from coming into contact with the surface the rest of the phone is resting on . The fact that this case is so inexpensive just adds to its otherwise perfect rating .	1
The mix of smooth and ridged surfaces is a nice touch aesthetically and it also helps to keep a nice grip as all smooth can be a bit slippery . The case fits like a glove and all the holes and cuts outs fit the various ports perfectly . The price on this item is hard to beat and it arrived quickly . I have n't tried it with any of the fun NFC features yet , but I 'm not anticipating any problems.All in all , if you 're looking for a nice , simple bumper case I suggest you look no further ( assuming the price is still good ) .	1
Fits like a glove . Adds no bulk to the phone - my GS4 stays slim and light ! The kickstand works , does n't slide around , nice and firm . It clicks shut with two tiny tabs of plastic on either end of the kickstand , so I guess if over time those tabs break then it wo n't stay shut anymore . But for the moment , the tabs are really tiny and hopefully will not break anytime soon.The only downsides I can find are : a. hard to feel whether or not if you pressed the power/volume button or not , there 's no tactile feedback when you push . They do work though.b . the screw ( ? ) that holds the kickstand in place on the back of the case bulges out and makes the phone sit slightly lopsided when you put it on a flat surface facing upward . Not an issue for me , but did n't expect the screw to bulge out the way it does.Otherwise very satisfied .	1
Simple but looks great ! ! Does the job , fits well , has a good grip . I love it and would definitely recommend .	1
Love this case ! It does n't look cheap , arrived on time , I can place it inside if my change purse wallet with the silver snap closure . It does protects your phone 's edges . I recommend this case .	1
Great cover the fit is perfect looks really good and the price was fair . The company also sent me 2 screen protectors for free they are perfect as well .	1
I like the product . It slips on easily , is not too bulky , but protects the phone . Glad to have this item and the same one of an alternate color .	1
I am impressed with this buy . The color matches the photos and it stands out ! ! ! I want to buy the other colors they offer on a later date .	1
This one actually fits and is rigid enough to stay on the phone . The material is 'gel like ' enough to glide in and out of my pocket without sticking to the fabric of my pants pocket . It is easy to grip and the lip on the front is raised enough to protect the screen if the phone is laying flat on the front .	1
Nice simple case that fits well . It does n't bulk up the phone much and looks good . It does n't mess up my screen protector on the edges .	1
I bought this for hubby who works in a restaurant so having a thin profile case ( to easily side in and out of the belt pouch ) was a must . The stripes on the sides make it easier to hold onto . Soft tpu case slips right on and can easily removed again for washing . Good price too.The only downside about this case ( and might not be for some people ) is that because the camera lens on the back of the S4 protrudes a little , you should use a case that is a little thicker on the back to better protect the lens from scratches . This case was a bit thin in my opinion . Why Samsung designed this phone this way is a mystery .	1
I tried the flip case and it was nice but always seemed to be in the way when I wanted to take a pic . This case is great , nice tight fit , and easy to hold onto . Does not add any bulk to my phone .	1
We some case for the money . Integrated kickstand works well . No complaints here at all . Very happy with this case	1
I love the design . So easy to use . I always get the cover with the stand in the back so it could hold when i 'm watching movies or browsing .	1
This case fits perfect and is durable . My only problem is I wish I would have opted for purple instead ( love purple ) .	1
I like it , it 's easy to put on and take off , and the color goes great with the phone and for the price it costs I bought more .	1
This cases from box wave are amazing , they fit my Galaxy S4 perfect , they are one of the best cases I have ever put on my phone and I am a case fanatic I have more than 10 cases from different company 's , but this one 's are going to be in my top list.Very good quality also good job guys .	1
Case is good for the purpose intended but the kick stand is kind of flimsy and feels like it may not hold for long .	1
I know it 's at a cheap price point , but it has a great fit , plenty of grip , does n't add much bulk at all , and when I dropped my phone on the pavement it bounced !	1
First let me say I absolutely adore this case . I got the winter white with kickstand for my white S4 . This is my 4th case for my S4 but its also my best case . Absolutely gorgeous ! I love the way it looks , good grip on the side , great design on the back partially see through white & fits quite nicely on the phone . Durable enough for me . If you are looking for a low price high quality plastic case . Look no further this is the one . Highly recommended .	1
This case is good . Not great , but good . I have a screen protector on my phone which gets slightly pushed along the edges by this case , so I do not use this case too much so that my screen protector does not come off . Besides that , it 's fine . Simple though .	1
When I get a new expensive phone I want to ensure I have all the protection I need so I go crazy and buy all I think I need . Good product . Buy it .	1
It 's laughable that people would rate this case lower than four stars . When you spend under $ 5 for a case designed to fit the latest and greatest smartphone on the planet , you 're getting a workaround . That was my intention when I purchased the BoxWave.I had been tempted to buy a folio case . Later , I asked myself why -- why do I need to cover the screen ? It 's made of Gorilla Glass 3 . It 's the toughest screen out there and nearly impossible to scratch . Someone said their phone , while in this case , shattered from a two-foot drop . I 've seen the GS4 survive multiple drop tests from the top of a ladder onto concrete -- with no case for protection . It 's built to take abuse . That 's why this case makes sense . In my personal opinion , you need a case like this so you can lay the phone on any flat surface . It raises the screen and the camera lens off your desktop . It also improves the phone 's grip in your hand . That 's what it 's for . And perhaps best of all , it barely adds to the phone 's already wide and tall dimensions . If you 've got a phone this big , do you really want it any bigger ? The buttons are not hard to push , but naturally , because they are covered by the case , they are a little hard-ER to press . Still , if you find it & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; to push the buttons , maybe what you really need is a little iron in your diet.The TPU material is essentially a hard rubber . Too hard and shiny to keep the phone from sliding on your car 's dash , so if you 're looking for soft rubber , keep looking . The material itself is naturally on the less-than-premium side , meaning it will build up scratches from constant use . Better that this gets scratched than the GS4 's own cheap plastic outer surface . The shiny & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; on the back will pick up finger prints . Not a biggie unless you have a pet peeve about such things.As for fit , the case snaps over the GS4 like a glove - quite perfectly , actually . There is no binding , nor is it at all loose anywhere . I would point out , however , that not all the holes are perfectly aligned . I 'm only being picky here . The camera cutout and speaker cutout are the tiniest bit off , not enough to make a difference , other than I notice it . The headphone and micro USB ports are wide open , so there are no problems plugging cords in.Get it as your primary case , or get it as a spare to give your phone a new look every once in a while . Either way , you know what you 're getting .	1
I bought this but the buttons were a bit too firm for my liking and got a different make/model gel case version . If you have your phone in your pocket a lot without a lock screen this might be better though so your not accidently taking pictures of your pocket though . Overall good quality , just a little to hard to get around with the buttons for me .	1
Good S4 case . Frost color looks nice on the cell phone and feels durable . Not bulky , but sleek , light , and trim .	1
I love its look and feel . The color is a bit lighter than the picture , but looks just fine . highly recommend this phone case .	1
5 stars based on price and protection.This covers every lip of my S4 and does n't pinch the screen protector I have ( Skinomi TechSkin which covers the entire screen , bezel to bezel.I had this case on my S3 until it got stolen -- definitely happy with both purchases . Looks pretty nice too and is simplistic -- the kickstand wo n't win any gold medals but it serves its purpose .	1
The case is a plain shiny black TPU material which fits snugly around the phone . For the price it ca n't be beat !	1
Good case for my SG4.. The case is slim and provides nice a good solid grip as well . Case is not very bulky at all .	1
The item arrived on time . Perfect fit and feel . Non slip so i can leave it on the dash or seat and does not slide around on turns . Price was less than i thought it would be considering the high quality look .	1
First off , I ordered the BoxWave Simple Element Gray Semi-transparent case I had to point this our since there 's only one review section for multiple cases.This case is billiant , it feels well , it has a better grip than a naked S4 . It 's really god that you can still see the samsung logo on the back thanks to the frosted plastic semi-transparent design but it does n't get scrached up easily like a completely clear case.So , now for the important bit , cases are supposed to protrect your phone and this case definitely does that and it does it quite well . The one-piece hybrid design provides a very good protection to the frame against drops and the lay on thr table desgin also provides screen protection.Port access is good , I had no problem using the original Samsung equipment and a couple of other headphones.The ONLY drawback for me . Power and volume buttons do n't provide a great tactile feedback when pressed with this case so this is why I 'll shave a star from the rating .	1
I like the & # 34 ; S & # 34 ; Pattern on the back . This has a nice grip on the sides and protects the case pretty well overall . Only con I can think of is sometimes the circular button at the bottom is difficult to press as well as initially starting to use the power button ( have to break in the case ) .	1
its not stylish or anything but it definitely works ! the black feels nice and protects your phone overall . get it .	1
Delivered in time for Christmas . It is just as described ; durable , does n't add too much bulk and would add adequate drop protection . The only negative would be that the lip going around the screen is n't that raised , so I 'm not sure of the level of protection for the screen if dropped . Other than that , an excellent value that looks quite sharp on the phone .	1
As described this case is a slim-fit ultra protective gel case . The feel is so nice . It does not slip out of your hand and the wavy design is very decorative . This case added a great touch to my S4 phone . An added plus was a free 2-pack screen protector . Great buy ! !	1
IT IS HARD TO PULL OUT THE STAND AND IT IS A TAD TIGHT TO TAKE OFF OF THE PHONE , OTHERWISE THIS IS PERFECT FOR PROTECTING YOUR PHONE AND THE BLACK COLOR GOES WELL WITH MY PHONE .	1
I love this style of case covers ! I only use case covers that have the extra grip on the side ! this always gives me a good grip and assurance that my phone will not slip out of my hands everthis one looks to be a better quality then few other ebay no name brand S curve cases	1
4.5 StarsPros : It keeps the phone thin and adds weight but not a lot.Looks good ( clear/white ) .Provides a little bit of texture and grip , makes the phone feel a little more secure in my hand ( I found it a little harder to hold on to before , as in , it slid very easily on flat surfaces ) .Has a decent sized lip to protect screen when phone is set face down on flat surface ( table ) .Fits my Samsung Galaxy S4 just fine.Cons : The power and volume buttons are a little harder to press but I was having trouble locating the power button without the case on in the first place so now there 's at least some texture to help me find it ( my previous phone had the lock/unlock/power button on the top right ) .Overall worth the $ 3.75 after shipping and handling . Have n't had it long so ca n't really comment on long term but overall exactly what I expected for the money I spent . Might even get the blue too if my opinions do n't change in the next few weeks . *Side note : I use my phone very gently , this is not the case for people who are rough and tumble with their phones .	1
Case arrived quickly and just as described . It 's a very stylish case . The front is glossy/shinny and the back is a flat/matte . Now I can grip on to the phone without compromising the thin , sleekness of the Samsung S4 . I love the flush design around the power and volume buttons , it keeps the buttons uncovered and easy to access yet difficult to accidentally hit . Great value , awesome find !	1
I love that 's it 's slightly clear so I can still see the white phone . It fits snug and is not bulky .	1
Seems to be a standard case . Is good for traveling and holding such a large phone with minimal case interference . I would recommend to others , but seems to just be a normal case . Nothing special but no complaints .	1
The phone is very easy to hold & fits the phone nicely and the only drawback is that the power and volume buttons are a little hard to press .	1
It was simple and the same as it appears on the screen . This was for my boyfriend and he likes it	1
Perfect protection and grip ! ! I love it for my wife 's phone so I bought it for a friend of mine too . He loves it as we 'll .	1
Pros fits tighly , provides great protection from dropping the phone . also covers the power button firmly , which is great because without a case my phone would turn itself on while in my pocket at times . this seems like a well made case , i would not be surporised if the manufacturer sold this same case under another name at a much higher pricecons . none so far	1
Fits great and looks good . I like the fact that it does n't add much thickness to the phone , but adds grip .	1
Nice slim and tight fit case . I was scared it would add bulk , but its perfectly slim and hugs the phone . My only gripe is that the cut outs are a little off . Not all the cutouts , just the charging port , speaker , camera , and top microphone . They do n't cover those parts , however , they are not centered and it looks funny . Since the charging port is off , my stock charger doesnt fit straight when plugged in , but it still is able to charge . Just scared it will end up mi- aligning the charging port if it gets hit or falls while charging . The camera and speaker looks off center because of those cut outs . Still fully functional and feels amazing.. thats why its still 4 stars .	1
Nothing flashy about this case . It 's basic black , but the good thing is , it 's matte on the backside . Around the edges it 's more shiny , which makes it more grippy . I like that the volume and on/off buttons are covered to keep dust out , but the covering does make the buttons harder to push . Cutouts are good , not quite perfect , but you 'd have to be OCD to notice . Seems to be secure , probably would not come off your phone inadvertently.BTW , the blackout case is completely opaque . The blue Arctic Frost Crystal Slip case is identical to it other than being blue and transparent.Right now , there are a few different prices listed for these . For me , the actual cost with shipping was around $ 3 , so it 's definitely worth that .	1
Item is as described . A simple and solid black design , at a great price . The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the power button has a cut out to push it , but its a little sunk in . Some people may not mind but its just a little hard to push . To some , this may be good so you do n't accidentally push the power button in your pocket . Overall this is a nice simple case . Seems well made .	1
I use this case on my phone everyday . I bought an Otterbox first but then ended up returning it . I did not like how it bulked up my phone . This case is slim and sleek and looks great on a black S4 . Not sure if I would buy it for a white phone . It also provided a little grip to but easily slides in a pocket . Can highly recommend this case . It provides protection and looks great .	1
This is a basic rubber case that does the job . Fits well and slides into the pocket easly and the phone rocks too .	1
Fits the phone perfectly . So simple , classy , and cute . Perfect for someone who doesnt want a flashy but nice case .	1
Got this for my mom , because she 'll never go out and get one for herself , ( typical moms.. lol.. ) and she loves it .	1
This is a snazzy looking case that fits the Samsung Galexy S4 perfectly . Got this for my wife and she like the feel of the case . Good protection and looks great . Maintains the slim fit and feel of the S4 , but now much easier to pick up and hold .	1
I 'm in love with the case . Flexible without being that annoying rubber material . Easy on and off . Everything works with case on like camera , flash , sensors , charger and all buttons . Lightweight and no added bulk ! Thank you ! !	1
I ordered the Blackout and the Airwave ( also by BoxWave ) because I could not decide which one I wanted . They both fit my Galaxy S4 just right , nice and snug . They are not bulky which I like . They are not rigid plastic , both are flexible ( but not flimsy ) but the Blackout case is a little more flexible than the Airwave . These cases cover a little more of the front of the phone than the other case I was using which is nice because it covers the side edges of my screen protector , Tech Armor Ballistic Glass , but without interfering with the viewing area of the screen . By the way it fits great with that screen protector so I do n't think anyone would have any problems with other screen protectors as this one is a little thick since it is glass . You do have to push a little harder for the side buttons but that does not bother me . All openings on the case line up perfectly .	1
I have the Samsung Galaxy S5 . This case fits perfectly although the color is lighter than pictured it looks nice and helps a lot with grip !	1
This case is well made and fits very well , I like the color , some black cases look very cheap but this one does n't . I 'm very happy with this case and would recommend it to anyone .	1
I ordered this to protect my phone and it did the job . I like that it is a non-slip like product and it still makes my phone look slim ...	1
Case has a simi hard back with a rubbery trim edge . The rubbery edge sticks up far enough that you do n't have to worry about the screen when you lay the phone face down . The phone fit snugly in the case and everything lined up perfectly . I thought my other case which was a gel case was nice but this is alot better than the all gel case . So far I 'm loving it and will definately recommend it to my friends . Overall outstanding case .	1
I have had the Galaxy S4 for a few weeks now and I have decided to buy a cheap case to protect it from scratching and cracking the screen . I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this case because I was n't sure it would satisfy me . Before purchasing this case , I looked on Amazon to see what other cases there were and all of them were sort of expensive and I just wanted something that would get the job done while not being too expensive and this was the best case I could find.After getting the case , I can safely say that there 's no other case out there that can beat this case in price . If anybody out there is not sure what case to get that will keep their Galaxy S4 protected then you have found the one . This case makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand and does n't add much bulk to the phone . It fits perfectly with the phone . One little thing that bothers me is that the buttons ( power and volume ) are a little hard to press but other than that , it 's hard to beat the price of this case.Pros : + Makes the phone comfortable to hold in hand+ Does n't add much bulk to the phone+ Fits the phone perfectly+ CheapCons : - The power and volume buttons are a little hard to pressOverall I am happy with the purchase I made and I 'm enjoying this case . I am always very careful with my phones and rarely ever drop them . I do n't need an expensive case but just one that will do the job . I hate having scratches on the back of the phone or cracks on the screen . I recommend this case to anyone who 's looking for a cheap case that will protect their phones without spending much money on an expensive case .	1
Let me start off by saying , like so many others reviewing this fabulous product . I bought this case just to tide me over until I could find a better higher quality one . I already have an Otterbox Commuter , but I like to have several cases . One that provides the most protection for when I 'm at work , and others that are smaller and do n't add so much bulk . Plus , I am somewhat of a case-whore . I had 12 cases for my S3.I thought this case would be a suitable temporary case until I could find another one . I was wrong . This is just a good case period ! Like I said , I prefer slim fitting cases so as not to detract from the over-all slimness of this device . I also prefer the soft gel feel of these types of cases to the hard plastic of others . I find it provides better shock absorbancy and just feels better overall.This is the highest quality case I have ever bought for $ 1.75 ( $ 4.25 shipped ) .Service-I ordered this on a Sunday night , and paid the minimum shipping price . I fully expected that it would n't show up for a week at least ( the fourth of July was the following thursday ) . When I got my confirmation email from Amazon they said that estimated arrival date would be the 6th-9th . Thus , I was pleasantly surprised to find the case waiting for me in my mailbox Wednesday afternoon . Took two days to get here . Very nice.Quality-As I said before , I am very impressed with the quality of this case for the price . It is the soft gel feeling plastic , with a glossy finish on the sides and top and a matte black grippy finish on the back . The back is nice because when you set it on your dash board it does n't try to slide off . You ca n't really see it in the pictures but it 's there and very noticable in person ( but not in a bad way ) .Needless to say , this case is a very tight fit on the phone , and everything lines up perfectly . I 've noticed that sometimes on these kinds of cases that cutout for the charging port wo n't be quite large enough and the usb cable wo n't plug in all the way . That 's just the trouble with these plastic molds sometimes . That is not the case here . Perfect fit . ALL the ports are perfectly cutout.As for the power and volume buttons , instead of being covered and thus harder to press they are cutout as well . They also fit perfectly and are not hard to press at all . That camera and speaker cutout is perfect as well.This case fits the phone so perfectly it 's unbelievable . Its not so tight as to be hard to get off and on but it is snug . Sometimes when I 'm peeling it off it will try to take the battery cover too , which is n't a bad thing in my opinion.Conclusion-Once again this case is the highest quality case I have ever bought for this low of a price . It keeps the phone slim but also provides the needed protection that you bought it for . Awesome , awesome case . I plan on checking out more products by this company.Overall , for less than five dollars out the door you will not find a higher quality case for your shiny new Galaxy S4 .	1
I like the way the case looks on my new S5 but it doesnt seem to fit quite as snug as i expected it to fit . Ive had the same cover for 2 of my previous phone ( iphone 5s and S2 ) and they were perfect but I dont know why this one just doesnt fit the same way .	1
I would defitnetly buy this case again it 's awesome & so small that it does n't even feel like it has a case on ,	1
Item is sleek with a simple design . It fits my Galaxy snug.Simple to take off , if my chance you have to access your batt.or mem.card . Product feels good and has a nice grip . Make sure to grasp it properly because the case and phone is light . I can access all points , w/o anything blocking on my phone . Plus , great price , I have no complaints .	1
I , like many others ordered it as a back-up . It is really far better than that . I hate cases that cover up the power buttons and volume rocker . This case has very nice cutouts for both allowing for direct access . It 's very plain so if it 's sexy you 're looking for , look elsewhere . But it fits snugly and provides decent protection . Good job BoxWave .	1
However its just that a simple case . Its good . It just does n't have grips or stands nothing more visible to make you really want this case . but overall it does it simple job .	1
Simply put , this is the best mobile phone case you can possibly buy for $ 2 + shipping ... period ! It 's a very well designed solid TPU skin case with excellent fit and finish , and precisely placed cutouts for power , volume , earphone , micro USB/charger , mic and sensors . The grip is superb ... your phone will never feel like it 's slipping from your hand , and it 's slim-fit and matte ' finished back will preserve the slender form factor of your elegant Galaxy S4 , and with none of the bulk of the multi-layer 'body armor cases ' on the market . It does n't offer the 'bomb proof ' protection of an Otterbox Defender , but it does n't claim to.It 's a simple , elegant , but protective case that unless you 're James Bond should suit your needs perfectly.On the other hand , 007 has always been style conscious . So yeah , I think he 'd like one , too ! UPDATE : I 've been using this case with my Samsung Galaxy S4 for just over a week , now , and would like to revise my opinion of it . It 's not only the best mobile phone case you can possibly buy for $ 2 + shipping , it 's also the best mobile phone case you can buy for $ 5.00 + shipping , the best mobile case you can buy for $ 10.00 + shipping , and maybe even the best mobile case you can buy for $ 15.00 + shipping , too ! I returned an Otterbox Commuter I 'd bought with the phone , and ordered another one of these , `` just in case '' . I really could n't be more pleased with this product !	1
Beautifully designed case . It provides great TPU protection without adding bulk to the phone . It fits great , nice and snug so you do n't have to worry about it ever coming off on its own , while still able to remove if needed . The color is stunning on the black phone , a nice deep jewel tone . The sides provide nice grip , and I love the matte back . The only issue is how difficult the power and volume buttons are to press , otherwise I would give it 5 stars . I would buy more if it came in more colors .	1
Amazing value for a quality case . Protects all sides ( similar cases from other manufacturers do not protect the top and bottom edges ) . Some complain about the buttons being hard to press - while it is slightly stiffer with the case on , you can still feel the click of the button when pressed . Also , pressing gets easier after a few weeks of use . This is , by far , my favorite case .	1
These BoxWave TPU Cases are getting better every generation ! This one really surprised me with it 's extra fine showing of detail , and now they are getting to be a piece of Art . The texture is very good , and the buttons are easy to feel & use without looking at them . I will be back to shop with BoxWave in the future .	1
The color is noticeably brighter than the picture , but it 's still a great case for the price and the color was not disappointing .	1
Even though I am not a fan of cases I still try them to see what are good and if I can come to keeping one ... .my preference still says no to cases but that 's a gamble I take again , since dropping my S4 before andresulted in my screen breaking ... that could of been avoided if i had a case on it.Slowly my trust and confidence in not dropping my phone has gone back up ... but I 'm taking risks and youshould protect yourself from having a broken or damaged phone.The case is pretty much all clear except the back is a matt white finish . Gives it a bit of a cool edge to it.The case is a bit too snug and a bit molded fatter on some parts of the trimming but the entire phoneis covered fine with the case . If I dropped it , I believe it will be saved but every drop is risky regardless ...	1
I looked at many cases from a few dollars to 50 bucks and chose this because oif the reviews and low costThis case is pliable and easily forms over the phone , with a tight fit.. You have to stretch the edges a bit to cover the front edges but when all said and done its perfect fit.I was concerned about cutouts for charger and volume control , but these are no problem , . plenty large enough to accommodate a charger cord of any type.Its removes as easlity as it goes on.For 6 bucks this was a real bargain and offers a better grip than the naked cell phone	1
I ordered two cases and I like the blue case better . Cimo S-Line Back Case Flexible TPU Cover . Good case but I preferred the blue better .	1
perfect , best price , great product !	1
Black case does its job . Protective and simple case . It 's a rubber silicone soft type ofCase . So good and came in the mail fast !	1
Great item as it was delivered on time , and fit the phone like a glove . The product has a very nice price , and i would buy another if I needed another color . Makes it easier to fit in your jeans back pocket .	1
I just received this for my Samsung galaxy s4 and it fit my phone perfectly and I love how it feel when I have my phone in my hand it do n't slide out my hand and I would recommend this product to family and friends the best case I had so far	1
The only bad thing about this case it that the white discolored after a really short period of time . It now looks more gray and dirty .	1
i think i dropped my phone once or twice with this case on ... No damage to case or phone so it does its job well.4 stars because it blocks wifi signal shortening the distance you can be from the WAP ... I guess this happens with all cases though ... : (	1
Protects whole device without adding weight or bulk . Also makes it much easier to grip , so no slippage . I also like the selection of colors !	1
Originally I had this case before BoxWave even had it . This is a generic case that BoxWave just put their name on . I loved this case so much that I bought another to replace my old one . ( long story on how but it was n't the case 's fault ) The Samsung Note is a big phone , but I did n't want to make it any bigger . A lot of case will make the phone bigger than what it is . But I did n't like the phone without a case because it is very slippery . This case fits perfectly and gave you a nice grip to hold the phone . It did n't make the phone that much bigger either.The case also had a nice bumper on it so if you dropped the phone it will take some of the impact . Also if you drop it facing down on the screen , it will prevent it from getting scratched.The only drawback to the case is the white rim around the edge wo n't stay white . My previous one was stained by my jeans in a few weeks and had a bluish/grey tint to it . I had the new one for about 2 weeks now and it is stained already . It is not that big of a deal to me but to some people it could be .	1
This case has a perfect snug fit . I had first tried the Dzitronic case which was very good , and seemed to be slightly thicker , and felt slightly heavier , but offered great protection . This case is more convenient for daily use since it is lightweight , and offers good protection . Judging from the thickness of the Dzitronic case cover.. it might be a better protector in case of accidental drops , but this boxwave case is looks better , feels better , and has a better fit although it is thinner and lighter .	1
I am very happy with this product . It came in less than a week in the mail for less than $ 3.00 . The AT & T store wanted $ 40.00 for the same battery . Thank you Amazon.com for saving us so much money !	1
It 's a battery not sure if a review is necessary . It 's OEM , works as expected , and holds the charge . Price was right .	1
What more can I say ? It holds it charge quite well.It is equal to , or better than , the original !	1
The product is as advertised - a genuine OEM Motorola battery . It looks exactly the same as the original battery that came with the phone . So it 's not a generic brand . Works great too . Somehow the package got lost in the mail ( or the seller forgot to send it ? ) . But after I contacted the seller a replacement arrived within the next few days . Though the package looked beat-up or had been in the ditch the content was intact . Great and speedy customer care to make up for a mistake .	1
The Razor does n't use much battery in standby mode but I do n't usually have a lot of time to charge devices so I bought a few of these to have on hand to get me through the week .	1
I was so happy to be able to find this battery . My dad is one of those people who still have the razor cell phone . He 's on his phone 24/7 so he eats up battery 's quick . This was an amazing price and came in two days ! So great . We were very happy with this !	1
I purchased a Motorola OEM BR50 replacement battery for my RAZR V3 cell phone . This battery is an excellent replacement for the original battery . It arrived fully charged and it lived up to its specifications as to talk time and standby life . Regarding the seller , order turnaround time was very fast . I would highly recommend the seller to everyone and I would definitely purchase from this seller again .	1
I 've had excellent results with this battery so far , I 've had it about a month ... I made sure that I charged it for 12 hours the first 2 times I charged it , also between charges I ran the battery completely down before recharging ... I think a lot of reason people have problems with their batter is that they do n't `` condition '' it properly	1
I was real hesitant to buy this battery . But for the price , and convenience of free shipping , I cant say that I regret it.The battery looks good , there is no wires or anything out of place , and for the price how could you go wrong ? I had to replace an old V3 battery that I used for overseas trips and never had an issue . Battery lasted longer than my original when I first bought it . Plus if you are getting better battery life and way cheaper battery why would you complain . Anyways , hope this review helps anyone setting on the fence like myself .	1
Much cheaper this way - prompt and reasonable shipping . Works well and I 've ordered some for gifts of other RAZR3 owners .	1
This battery is for my super old Moto V3 phone that I am using as secondary phone . this is my 3rd battery on the phone since i bought it many years ago . ( wow the phone is still working ) anyway , it gave 6-7 days of stand by time . I am using the phone to recive SMS only . I am not really using it for calling much now.But when I was using it actively for few weeks ( after my primary phone broke down ) it gave me solid 4.5 days of calling and texting time . Not bad ... really ... I can recomend this battery strongly.S .	1
Ordered this for my grandmothers phone and know she is rocking and rolling . The battery is a good quality and the phone charges well with it .	1
Even though my Nokida model , 6126 , was listed as working when this arrived I thought oh-man they shipped the wrong thing . Then I looked at the model number on the cable and it was the one I ordered . Then I thought oh man I ordered the wrong thing.Turns out it works even though all the connections do not seem to match , it is secure , and actually have a very high transfer rate . So if you get it out and it does n't seem like it would fit , play with it until it snaps in and it probably will work for you if your model is listed .	1
Up till last year , I was still fully into one of those old-school Sony CD-Walkmans for my music . My cell-phone was too old and could only be used to make phone calls..Then , I finally upgraded my cell-phone.So now all I needed to enjoy music from my phone was a USB cable to connect my Nokia to my old Compaq computer ( the computer upgrade would come only recently ) .I first decided to order a no-name USB compatible cable , big mistake . So I went back and ordered the Nokia OEM CA-53 USB data cable , great choice ! I 've had the cable for about a year now and overall , it works great . The cable material itself feels much better than the generic brand I bought . For the most part , the music that I rip from my CD 's are transfered flawlessly to my Nokia phone.The only minor complaint I have is that sometimes the physical connection between the USB cable and my Nokia phone is a little too easily knocked-off . So I have to take care not to touch the phone at all while data is being transfered.Overall this is a solid choice that I definately recommend for your Nokia phone .	1
This was from 3 phones ago ( at least ) . But I remember it did the job well . I had no problems with it .	1
This arrived in what appeared to be a Nokia retail package , and had Nokia insignia on the cable . It appeared to be genuine . The package lists only a few Nokia phones by number , then says `` and compatible phones '' . Orientation of the unique Nokia plug ( ? POP ) is not obvious and the plug does not go in easily ( until it 's perfectly lined up ) . For my 6126 the plug needs to be oriented with the Nokia insignia to the front of the phone . Once connected the cable worked perfectly .	1
I am sure this cable works fantastically.As long as it is used with the correct phone . I should have know better , but the price was so incredibly low- especailly having originally purchased the correct cable from Nokia 2 years ago for fifty bucks- that I felt , even if my phone was not listed , hey , it could still work , right ? Wrong . But in an effort to write a 'helpful ' review I have to add , it is in fact an OEM Nokia CA-52 cable , it was very inexpensive , and it arrived much sooner than expected .	1
I 've been searching for months for this package . The OEM price is about 20 times the price I paid here at Amazon.com - no kidding ! Arrived before schedule , new condition , and came with everything advertised . It took a little time to install and had many updating to do but worked the first time after installation and works every time since.Anyone looking to purchase this package will be astonished and surely satisfied - I know I am . The application is thorough in design and allows for an extensive view of the internal applications of my cell phone ( Motorola RAZR V3 ) . Excellent phone and excellent application for data transfer between my computer and cell phone . An absolute necessity .	1
I had lost the CD for the previous Motorola Phone Tools and was unable to reinstall in my Boot Camp partition . So , I bought the `` Motorola Razr V3 Oem Original Usb Data Cable with Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software '' kit and threw away the cable ( no razr here . ) At 49 cents you ca n't go wrong ! Now I 've got the Moto Phone Tools installed on my new iMac .	1
The Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 software worked perfectly with my RAZR V3 phone . It quickly installed and updated and walked through driver installation on XP . Once the phone was connected it performed all functions without any problems . The software also remembers several profiles which is handy since we have multiple phones for the family . Finally , the software uses standard cables to interface to the phone unlike some products that require a special cable keyed to the software .	1
This thing is really great ! I work in a metal building that is quite a ways from the nearest cell tower , with several hills between us and the tower . Before we bought this amplifier we had to run outside into the parking lot to be able to maintain a conversation . We installed the outside antenna on the roof and the amplifier in the telephone closet and now we have full signal in our offices , which is better than we have in the parking lot . Highly recommended .	1
The YX510 dual band repeater works well . I bought it mainly for a Verizon broadband USB modem that was only getting at best 2 bars and sometimes none . As soon as I hooked up the zboost ( with the signal antenna at the roof peak ) , I went to 5 bars . I was getting RSSI of -100 and up and that went to -65 so I am getting a good signal to the USB modem now . I went from download/upload speeds of 100/75 to 650/250 . I have the zboost sitting right beside the laptop so I can not speak for range . I have n't tried it with my cell phone but its bars went up , too . It is a tad pricey , but it makes broadband possible for me whereas my only other choice would have been Hughes Net satellite which is n't getting such great reviews from users and is not portable at all .	1
When installed according to instructions , this unit fulfills all its claims.NOTE that for the best success , you should separate the external antenna and internal base unit by as much distance and signal-obstruction as possible -- put the outdoor antenna at at the best available signal location , and the indoor base unit in the worst dead-zone . Use every inch of the 50 ' cable supplied.My installation is in a steel-framed and steel-skinned building -- getting a signal inside was basically impossible . The outside antenna is on an old TV antenna mast 5 ' above the building roof , and the inside unit is sitting on top of a suspended ceiling in the center of the main area . Now I get 5-bars on Sprint anywhere inside the building , and 3-4 bars within 10 feet or so of the building outside . Our ATT data card gets a 5-bars signal also . ( We are thus using both bands on this unit at once . ) While not cheap , it is the least expensive alternative available , and It Just Works ( tm ) .	1
We bought this unit about a year ago and it helped . We live way out in the sticks and are probably 3-5 miles ( as the crow flies ) from the cell tower . Before setting up the booster we were lucky to get any service in the house . Afterwards we could get 2 or 3 bars , but had to stay fairly close to the base unit . Recently I added the dual-band directional antenna and our signal strength on both of our iPhone4 's is maxed out at 5 bars throughout most of the house . This product is worth the money as long as you remember to also purchase the directional antenna if you are in a far fringe area . Adding the external antenna seems to increase the range of the base unit.Update ( 09-13-10 ) : I have found one complaint . So far I am on my third OEM power supply . The little power block died at about the same time as a lightning storm went through and made our house power hiccup so I 'm not sure what knocked out the block ( yes , it IS on a surge protector ) . I bought a variable DC power supply as a backup since I could not find a `` generic '' power supply that would work ( 3.6VDC , 2.0A ) . I also added a grounding wire on my outdoor antenna . Since then I have n't had a problem . All I am saying is I wish they would include a little more robust power supply with this unit . I still think the unit is worth it , just think about an additional power supply if you are susceptible to power failures , lightning strikes or both .	1
We got this for my son to use on his job as he drives all day long . He uses it for keeping in contact while on the road and the hands free operation is the only way to go . The Bluetooth syncing and operation is very easy to set up and the connection is good . The battery also has a good life and he needs it as some days are long ones for him.The sound quality is good and he can hear the caller clearly and we can hear him well . The price we paid was a lot less that the $ 40 they are asking here . I only mention this as he goes through Bluetooth ear pieces quite frequently from daily use , to breaking them to simply losing them.We gave him a really good stereo set that he uses at home and to listen books and music but he uses the lower priced ones while he is on the road . This Jabra is reasonable quality and performance for the money .	1
This was my first Blue Tooth earpiece because I was waiting for the price of these items to drop , and I found this Jabra BT125 Bluetooth Earpiece as I browsed the item on Amazon . The Purchase/Delivery was very simple , and it was delivered as promised . I would recommend this Item and this Seller to anyone/everyone .	1
Wow ! I was surprised when I read the reviews on this product . It is DEFINITELY made for people with smaller ears ! Other bulkier ear pieces have not fir very well but this one fits GREAT ! Also , I noticed alot of first time users that were rating this product..I HAVED used both WIRED earpeices and now bluetooth . This one is MUCH BETTER than most about not picking up backround noise but when it DOES get to be a little much , simply turn DOWN the volume a little on your PHONE not on the blooth tooth . Using that adjustment may give you a little better fine tuning for the device . ALSO , many phones include a feature that allows the mic to ignore heavy backround noise . I am an alltel user and many of my phones have had this feature . The batter has been GREAT TOO ! I have owned this blue tooth device for over a year now , AND LOVE IT ! ! !	1
This was a nice one but ear peice kept breaking finally got the blue ant	1
I got this earpiece for my wife to use . When we talk it 's clear and fits snug to her ear which is a plus so she can do whatever and not have worry about loosing it .	1
I purchased several months ago . I just love this device . In the past 2 weeks I have tried some other in the 80.00 price range , but this on works the best . It is plenty loud ( I have hearing loss from fighting in Iraq ) , very comfortable to wear all day and never drops out on my iPhone .	1
This was a gift for my brothers iphone . He loves it so far & has no problems with it . When the phone is off it turns into a mirror finish . Protects the screen real well & he has no problems using his touch screen with this on . He says in normal lighting it darkens the screen slightly so no one on the sides can see what is on his screen . He is happy with this product & likes it better than the clear one he had before .	1
Mirror works very well but becomes troublesome when under direct light as it reflects towards you .	1
I bought this product hoping that it would provide some privacy when riding the train to work everyday . Although it does , it is minimal at best . It is exactly as advertised , `` Mirror Like Screen Protector '' ... you can see yourself when the iPhone is off as if you were looking in a mirror.I do n't feel that it hinders the brightness/colors of the phone much at all ... However , in intense sunlight it can be hard to read the screen do to glaring.Pros : Your iPhone screen is protected , and you have a always available mirrorCons : Can cause a glare in bright areas , extremely hard to attach without some sort of bubbles on the edges . ( though I was able to get it right ) I bought this in conjunction with theelago iPhone 3G Slim Fit Case - Black + Microfiber Cleaner ( Made in Korea ) and could n't be happier .	1
Bought this for my girlfriend 's phone so she could listen to music on it.. Very stupid you had to get this for a Walkman Phone.. Great Price and worked as intended..	1
Bought two of these for my children 's W300i in December . So far , both are working fine for headphones . But , they do not work for `` headsets '' as advertised . According to wiki , a `` headset '' includes a mic .	1
Does what it 's supposed to do . Headphones play from my sony phone w/o the bulk of the factory model . No button from which to answer incoming calls , though .	1
Nice does what it is supposed to do .I like it for the reason it is way shorter that the stock one I put it on my sony w 810 and can listen to the phones radio though the phones speaker with out a long cord being in the way while im riding my bike that way everyone can hear the radio while we are riding	1
Awsome works as expected and sound is just as good as out of my ipod ... fast shipping	1
This is the 4th one of these I have owned , first one from Amazon . The first one I gave away to a friend , who forgot to plug in their phone more than I do , the next two I ran through the laundry machine ( do n't do that ) . I ca n't live with out this thing ... well ... if I can live with out my phone , I might be able to live with out this , which I hear one can live with out a phone , but I am unwilling to test this . How else can you steal the batteries from the TV remote to charge your phone as you run out the door for work ? ! ? Yeah , its just that cool ! Bottom line , will everyone need one , no , just those of us that have forgotten to plug in their phone , or have been talking on our phone all day and have yet another important call to make , or ca n't find their charger in there suit case despite KNOWING you packed it or ... you get the idea .	1
I have two of these chargers and have bought a few others for colleagues and we 've all been rather impressed with them . They 're reasonably well-built and work . I did n't have any of the quality control issues that one reviewer had with the battery terminals . I normally use Sanyo Eneloop rechargeable AA batteries with mine and have n't had a problem with connections . I use it to charge my PDA , personal Motorola Razr phone , and corporate Blackberry . ( Thank you God for whoever decided to finally standardize some devices with the mini-USB connector ! ) It does seem to take about 1-2 hrs to charge up the devices , which is as long as it normally takes when they 're connected to their native chargers.These units ARE picky about battery voltages . If the AA batteries are partially discharged , it might not see them . In terms of battery usage , using regular rechargables , you can expect to get one full charge on your phone from the batteries because of the high voltage requirement of the charger to start up . There 'll still be juice left in the AA 's , but good luck getting the little chip inside these chargers to wake up.What would I like to change ? 1 ) The very high low-voltage cutoff . Chances are you 're using these in an emergency situation when power is n't available or nearby . These are the times when you want EVERY last ounce of power , even if it 's only 5 minutes worth of charging time . 2 ) The charging tips are detatchable and are too easy to lose and a longer cord would be appreciated , especially when trying to talk on the phone and charge . 3 ) A different battery door design . The current design is solid , but can be a bit challenging to replace the door after changing batteries.Overall , a little gadget no road warrior should be without . Its shortcomings are minor compared to the functionality it provides .	1
This is an upgrade of an earlier single battery unit . When my cell phone goes low and I am without my charger , as when my car breaks down and is towed to repair shop and I am in a rental car , it is great to have the capacity to quickly add charge to the phone . Toss one in the glove box for that , 'Just in case ' moment . The dual battery unit charged my Smart Phone to about 50 % ( from dead ) in 15 minutes .	1
This product works great , my phone died on a camping trip , and I had bought 2 of these . They charged it so I could talk on the phone and text on the way back . I use the Eneloop rechargeable batteries so I can recharge them after I use them.The other reviewer does not understand that his cell phone battery can store more energy than 2AA batteries . These chargers will add a couple hours of talk time but not fully charge your phone . If you need to fully charge your phone I would suggest a normal charger because these would take too many batteries for normal use.I love these chargers , and will always keep one in my car . They have saved me more than once .	1
I bought two of these and keep them in the glove boxes of both cars . In the event of a car accident or other emergency , I can use them to charge the cell phones if they 've run out of power.The included lithium battery has a ten year shelf life , so it will be ready when you need it . I consider it good , cheap insurance .	1
I actually ordered the incorrect battery and before I could return it , the company had the correct battery sitting in my mailbox . I wish there was an option for better than perfect service as this company deserves it .	1
because I used this as a back-up when my old battery would n't hold a charger for a long period of time and it worked like a charm .	1
After having my Blackberry for about 6 months the life on the battery started to diminish and I wanted to replace it . This was a great price and it boosted my battery life back up to a week or more instead of one day .	1
I have a Blackberry 8220 that I beat to death on a daily basis and the battery life on it just was dismal . So , after a week with this I 'm back to normal , and I do n't have to feel like I 'm tethered to my desk or will wake up in the morning with a dead battery.You get what you pay for when it comes to batteries , so do n't be surprised if it does n't work as well as the original RIM-made battery 4x the cost .	1
`` $ 6 for a battery ? too good to be true ? '' That 's what I thought , `` but for $ 6 , why not give it a shot ? '' I 'm just using it as a `` second '' battery because the Pearl 8130 has such poor battery life , I could throw this in my luggage , or whatever when I go on a trip . Well , I 've been swapping back and forth between my original and this one for a few weeks now ( to make sure they stay charged ) and I can never tell the difference in life , they both seem to work exactly the same . The only difference is this one has a non-OEM looking sticker wrapping it , looks to be printed from a scan of an OEM .	1
I 'm not sure if I would wear this in public , but I got this because of the good reviews it received with regard to sound quality & noise cancellation . Sound is crsytal clear & deep . I got it to work with the Sony Bluetooth adapter , Sony Vaio laptop , my Nokia cell phone , & my iPod Touch . A big plus is that you can use it as a passive headset by plugging in a 3.5 mm audio cable . It 's a good idea to purchase the carrying case to protect it while transporting or storing .	1
Raves : When used as a headset for Skype , the microphone is surprisingly effective . Sound quality is much better than with tiny in-the-ear devices.Comfort and battery life is also excellent -- I charge mine overnight and wear it all day long.Cautions : Extending and retracting the adjustable headband should be done with care . I pulled mine out a little too quickly once and it came apart . Fortunately , nothing was broken and I was able to carefully reassemble it with no harm done.When pairing , it helps to hold the headset within a few inches of the PC bluetooth antenna.Rants : The `` Features '' list includes `` Wired connection for use with all stereo MP3 players . '' However , the cable necessary for this to work is not included . To be fair , it is n't listed in `` What 's In the Box '' , either.Range is a little disappointing . I bought a class-1 bluetooth adapter hoping that it would help , but I 'm still limited to two walls indoors and about 100ft outdoors .	1
I got my headset the other day . To my surprize they are rather large , but hey they fit better than my Sony BT22 headset . I guess as long as your listen to your music they do n't look so crazy wearing them outside.Now sound quality is not bad . The ear piece really blocks out outside noise , which help hear your music or the person on the phone that you are talking to . I asked a friend if could hear me ok after we finshed talking . They said I was loud and clear . Then I told them that I was on my new bluetooth headset . They was like really I could n't tell.The controls are very easy to remember how to control the music and the phone . After wearing them for a while they do cause a little discomfort , but I 'm sure anything you have over your head in time is going to get a little uncomfortable . But all in all I like them . Hell you ca n't beat the price . I know for a fact that you go inside a retail store and but these you looking at $ 100 easy.If you do n't mond the bulkyness they are a good buy .	1
Finally , after 4 tries , I have found a set of bluetooth wireless headphones that I can actually live with.Are they perfect - NO ! I 'll get into the pros and cons below , but first I 've got to say that when I started my quest to purchase a decent sounding , less than a 100 lbs , and less than a fortune set of wireless headphone , I did not expect it to be this difficult.For my music source I purchased the Verizon ENV2 , and added an 8 GB chip.I first ordered the JBL 610 ( $ 125 ) . While they paired up perfectly , they sounded much too tinny and felt cheap . Return # 1.Next I ordered the top-of-the line Sony DRBT50 ( $ 165 ) . These were light weight , felt great , and when I got stereo , they sounded wonderful . Unfortunately , they would not stay in stereo mode , kept reverting back to mono . Also , the controls were badly placed and I kept hitting the controls when I put them on . Return # 2.Next came the Jabra BT8030 ( $ 137 ) . They paired easily and sounded very nice ( they have chip enhanced bass ) . Also - they turn into stand-alone speakers and they really sound great in that mode . The sound level actually doubles . Unfortunately , they weighted about a ton and I felt really stupid when I walked around the mall with them on . Oh yea , the ad claimed 32 hours of use between charges , but once I got them the specs said 7-8 hours . Big difference . I thought about keeping them for the stand-alone stereo - but - back they went . Return # 3.That 's when I gave up and bought a pair of Bose wired headphone ( the cheap $ 150 pair ) . They sounded great and lightweight - but once I got them on the plane I remembered why I wanted wireless phones . I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off . So after a couple of weeks of this , I decided to try one more time . I kept the Bose for the office.I purchased the Motorola S805 , basically out of sheer desperation . They were only $ 88 at Amazon ( I love Amazon ! ) , and free shipping , so I gave them a try . Surprisingly , they paired easily and sounded really good . They were not especially light weight , but fit fine on my head and were not all that heavy ( 8 oz ) . No glitches the first 3 days , then all at once I went to turn them off , and they went in pairing mode and the only way to get them out was to plug in the charger . A couple of more days went by and one morning they would not turn on ( had plenty of charge ) . So I decided they were defective , and I sent them back and got a replacement pair . After about 3 days with the replacement set , once again they went into pairing mode , and then later would not turn on . Hum , if it happened the same way twice , then it probably was not a defect but something I was doing wrong . So I experimented with them for a few days and figured it out . Here goes : If you follow the instructions when turning them off and wait until after all 3 flashing lights before releasing the on/off button , they will go into pairing mode . If you release the button as soon as the first flash happens , they turn off . A quirk , but , given my history and desperation , not all that hard to live with . Next , why would they not turn on sometimes ? I found this one by accident . I went to turn off the headphones , but forgot to first press the music play/stop button , just turned off the phones . That did it , they would not turn back on until I plugged in the charger and `` reset '' them . Okay , for most people that would be enough to `` send them back '' but I really want wireless headphones so I am keeping them.A few other observations : ( 1 ) I tested the charge time and so far they 've gone 16 hours on a single charge , and they were still working . They are rated at 17 hours . Charge takes almost exactly 3 hours . ( 2 ) A big pro is the case , hard shell and very nice . Room to store the charger and supplied wired cable . ( 3 ) They transition seemlessly from stereo headphones to hands-free phone headset . When you hear the ring tone , just press the Phone button and you are talking . Clear as a bell . Not sure how my voice is coming through , but have not received any complaints so I assume it is clear as well . When you are finished with your call , press the phone button again , and you are back to music in a couple of seconds . The music is paused so you do n't miss a note . ( 4 ) The ad says they reduce noise and echo , but I did not find either of these to be true . Background noise is not noticably reduced , and there is a noticable echo when walking in the mall . Does not really bother me , but you should be aware of this . Have n't tried them on the plane yet . ( 5 ) Controls : I like the placement of the controls . Took me only a couiple of days be become an expert at lowering or raising the music volume ( a wheel ) , skipping or repeating a song ( a different wheel ) , pausing ( quick push of a button ) , or answering the phone ( quick push of a differnt button ) .Okay , that 's about it . I will keep them and I do recommend them if you do n't mind dealing with a quirk or two . Besides , $ 88 ( now $ 79 I see ) is n't all that much money to be the first on your block to own some new high-tech gadget .	1
My purpose for buying the S805 headphones was to hook them up to my Home Theater so that I could watch movies , hear the PS3 , and listen to music all in one place.Most of the other reviews cover the product fairly well , so I will mention the one thing that made a difference for me : the Bluetooth transmitter.I had the Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor ( A120s ) and figured since my Motorola S9 Headphones worked fine with it ; then these Motorola S805 headphones should work fine as well . I was wrong . After spending close to an hour of transfers , hang ups , and poor English , I finally got an answer from someone at Motorola 's support line : `` The S805 is not compatible with your transmitter . '' I asked them in return , `` do you sell a transmitter that will work with them ? '' for which their reply was , `` Only one that works with an iPod . `` So , I had to find another alternative . Someone here at Amazon mentioned in their review that they used the Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor ( TMR-BT10A ) with success . I broke down and ordered this , investing more than I had intended , but was pleased to find that the Motorola S805 headphones indeed work with this Sony Transmitter . I have n't used it much to do further testing , but it seems to work fine at close range ; walking out of the room cuts the signal in and out , and if it totally drops you have to re-sync it . But I 'm usually sitting on the couch , less than 10 feet away , and so far it works like a charm.So to sum-up:1 ) Jabra Bluetooth Music Adaptor ( A120s ) = does not work with the Motorola S8052 ) Sony Bluetooth Transmitter Adaptor ( TMR-BT10A ) = does work with the Motorola S805If there are others , I 'm not aware of them.Other things to note on transmitters:1 ) My Bluetooth dongle on the computer did not connect these headphones either . My understanding is that you must have an A2DP ( Advanced Audio Distribution Profile ) compatible dongle for it to work.2 ) The PS3 may have connected the device , but I did n't try as after some research , I learned that the system does not play game sounds and music through the Bluetooth connection . It is only good for talking back and forth with other gamers . Hopefully Sony adds this feature in the future .	1
I was looking for a decent and cheap set of bluetooth headphones for my Macbook Pro and came upon these . After reading some of the reviews , I thought it would n't be such a bad buy considering the price . As the title says , these headphones do not work well with a Macbook Pro . Sure it will connect and everything , but the bluetooth setup that apple has on these laptops suck . I mean , the sound has a lot of static and cuts out . I 'm not sure if its OSX that 's the problem or the bluetooth radio but all I know is that the sound coming from the headphones just did not sound nice . At this point I wondered if it was the headphones or the computer . So I switched to my Compaq running Windows XP and lo and behold it sounded incredible . No static , no cutouts , nothing . The sound was crisp on both bass and treble songs . It was easy to connect and was running A2DP . I can bet that most people who rated these headphones poorly either had a non A2DP compatible source or was using a Macbook Pro . So even though I enjoy my Mac , all I can say is that apple skimps out on small things like bluetooth and to some people that means a lot . Overall the headphones were comfortable and felt very solid . The charge time is long ( 3 hours ) , but is definitely worth it . I have yet to try these with a A2DP cellphone so sorry if I do n't review call quality and such . Even with my problem with my Macbook Pro , I thought that it was n't the headphone quality that affected the sound , it was the computer and that should n't affect the overall rating of the headphones , so I rated these 5 stars.Pros : Cheap ! Sound is impressive on both treble and bass . Stereo SoundSturdy constructionComfortable fitEasy to connect , just read the instructionsLong battery lifeCons : Does n't work well with a Macbook ProLong charge timeMake sure you have A2DP on your computer or cellphone . This does affect the sound quality.Hopefully this review is helpful	1
I purchased these about 8 weeks ago for use at work . So far , here 's my experience : + Positives ++ Loooooooong battery life+ Comfortable enough to wear 6+ hours at a time+ Good sound quality+ Easy controls for volume , etc+ Around $ 30 . One of the cheapest I 've found for bluetooth headset+ Noise cancellation works ... if you have music going ( why have them on if you do n't ! ) - Negatives -- Wall charger that came with them was a MICRO usb charger , not the MINI usb charger that it requires . However , I had plenty of mini usb cables , which I used to charge them with from my PCOverall , these bluetooth headphones are and excellent value - would definitely recommend ... especiall for the $ 30.Final note , these do not come `` packaged . '' They arrive in your box inside of a plastic bag with the wall charger ( probably the wrong type ) , the headphones , and the `` manual '' .	1
( Yes , that 's wordplay on a Prince song . ) I hate headsets because I 've never found one that really truly works for me . Sure , I can hear through them and I can speak and others hear me but it 's they 're not problem-free by any stretch of the imagination . But , I keep searching.I was first drawn to this because it 's red . I 'll be honest . Then I realized that it was small . And then , inexpensive . So I bought it to use with my iPhone.I 've been using it for about five weeks as of this review . It 's super easy to pair , it fits nicely in my ear and to date , has not fallen out once . The charger is a neat little case which for some reason , I like.I find that I often have to turn the volume down on the headset because it 's just too loud even while driving with the windows down . People I talk to have said that they do n't even notice that I 'm using a headset which is important to me . I hate when people use headsets that make them sound far away or like they 're standing in a silo . One time I was standing outside and it was getting ready to storm and the wind was blowing like crazy . My friend did say he could n't hear me well with the wind blowing that hard into the microphone . Makes sense.That 's been the only trouble though . Oh , and the thing is so small it 's easy to lose in a purse for sure and easy to forget when you put it in your front jeans pocket . It 's had a few close calls with the washing machine.I like it . Sound is good and my friends do n't hate when I use it and it stays in my ear without that goofy hook thing on my other bluetooth headsets that get tangled up in my hair or does n't sit well under or over my sunglasses.UPDATE 11/6/2009 : I just wanted to add that it 's been over two years since I bought this and I 'm still using it daily . It still works great even though it 's been through the ringer - lost , dropped , even put through the laundry cycle ! Still highly recommended .	1
I 've had this bluetooth for over a year now and it works like a charm . It 's small and lite weight , so far no problems . The sound quality is great coming in and going out . Who would have thought something so small would be so powerful , technology is amazing . I would recommend this Bluetooth to a friend , in fact I 'm going to buy another one just so I can have two .	1
I 've been testing 8 headsets and to my surprize , this little thing has better sound quality than 7 of them ! ( The one exception I 'll explain ) First of all it 's super light and fits so well that you 'll forget it 's in your ear . Really ! It feels so snug that it does n't feel like it might fall out , unlike many others . ( Forget that optional ear loop thing . It made it worse . ) Second , when it needs recharging there 's no need for plugging and unplugging wires . Just set it in it 's case and close the lid . Take it out when it 's done . ( The case stays plugged in . No messing with the wire . ) Third and most important to me is the sound quality . I compared these 8 headsets : Plantronics Voyager 510 , Plantronics Explorer 320 , Jabra BT8040 , Jabra BT500 , Motorola HS850 , Motorola H700 , Jawbone , Samsung WEP200 . I compared them head-to-head by pairing two at a time , putting one in each ear , and switching between them while on the same call . This lets me and the caller compare the sound quality for both of us . I do this in a few different environments with a few different background sounds . This puppy sounded clearer than all the others except one and specifically in one situation . Here 's the exception : loud background noise . Now hear me out , I work in construction and background noise is a huge issue for me at work . I 've never found any headset that handles background noise better than the Plantronics Voyager 510 . Not the Jawbone or anything else . So for me the Samsung WEP200 wo n't work . Mostly because of the background noise , but also because it 's cute red color would make me stand out like a bullseye at a firing range . But , it 's not for me ! It 's for my mom and she loves it ! ( and she wo n't be doing construction anytime soon ) So if you do n't have a noisy environment then I give this an A+ . Yes , it sounds hollow in a car . Yes , if the wind blows straight into it the caller ca n't hear you . But I have n't found one that does n't do that , and this has clearer sound than all of them . ( With my one exception ) Oh , one more thing . It has 4 hours of talk time which is less than the others ( they range from 6-12 ) , so if you talk a lot , for the price you can buy two . Charge and pair them both and you 'll have a spare .	1
I purchased this to use in my vehicle so I wouldnt have to use a head set or worse hold the phone while driving . I was impressed that it works as well as it does . I have had no problems with this device . I am able to charge it the car if I have to and charge well at home . You can use the same USB power cord as for your phone ( if its a MOTO RAZR model NOT the new V9 ) . I take this for short trips in town . Sadly to say it will be used as a Back up due to being replaced by the MOTOROKR T505 . If you are leary about trying this ... JUST DO IT . If you dont like it Amazon will take it back . For a first purchase you cant go wrong .	1
This device paired right away with my Motorola T305 . the seller eforcity shipped out same day , item arrived in perfect condition .	1
It would get five stars from me for the sound quality and ease of pairing and use alone , except for one thing : I ca n't get the furshlugginer clip that holds the thing to the visor to stay in for the life of me . *Every* time I pull down the speaker to recharge it , the clip slips off and goes flying . Drives me nuts . I 'm considering duct tape.Still , it gets great battery life and is generally a great speaker with excellent sound quality , especially for the money . I got mine for 20 % off at a brick-and-mortar CompUSA going out of business sale , but I 'll buy another one for full retail if this one ever kicks the bucket . ( I do , however , have one HUGE caveat : Motorola 's customer service is extremely terrible , and I will only buy fairly disposable items from them , i.e . items it would be cheaper to replace than repair . I found this out when I bought a Motorola Razr phone that quit and had to be sent in for service . I had paid through the nose for an unlocked phone ; they sent it back locked ; multiple calls to 800-service resulted in long waits on hold and nothing but empty promises of resolution of the issue ; they finally mailed me a new phone after I reported them to the Better Business Bureau ; when I sent in the old phone as requested , their service office mailed it BACK to me , claiming they had already repaired it . I 'm still waiting for them to come after me and request their old phone back . Ay , carumba . )	1
We just bought these for our cars and they are fantastic . Work great with our samsung phones . The speaker volume is great and the person on the other line could n't even tell we were n't on a phone . They are extremely easy to set up and use.We could n't decide if we should get these or headphones , but glad we got these.Just ordered two more for my parents.Only complaint is that it does not come with a wall charger , only a car charger .	1
I brought this for modifying it so that it can turn on when car started and shut off then car turned off . Once I opened it up , I noticed there only one microphone inside . With only one microphone , it can not do noise cancellation . I also noticed the speaker is quit small . I think if I can find a long microphone wire to wire the microphone to somewhere facing the driver mouth and replace the speaker with a larger one , it might work well . Of source I have to disable the internal 4V lithium ion battery to let car battery provide the power , so that when car power off , it will stop working . I need to insert a small delay circuit , so that when car powering on , it will turn on the T305.I wish Motorola making the modification for it , that will make people 's life a lot easier:1 ) make the bluetooth car kit powering on when USB power is on and powering off when USB power is off ; 2 ) Make a microphone jack so that user can extend the microphone wire to somewhere they like microphone to be.For under $ 30 , this is a very good device . I would get this instead of in-ear bluethooth device . I lost too many bluetooth device hang on my ear . I installed one of the Motorola higher end bluetooth car kit in one of our cars . That one works well , but installation was a lot of work . I think this is a good improvement on easy installation ; but manually turn it on and off is a pain .	1
I got this for my daughter to use in her car . It works great ; has good voice quality and is compact so she can easily hide it or put it in her purse for safekeeping .	1
Simple , cheap , works great and exactly what you need for hands free use . Nothing found that matches the value and quality	1
Good deal , works fine for my purposes . Seems like I always have to say `` Hi '' twice , after that it works just fine . Good battery performance .	1
I wanted an alternative to something in my ear ( which always falls out ) while I drive & this was the perfect solution . It 's incredibly easy to pair with your phone & set up . I found charging it took no time at all & it fits perfect on the visor just above where I talk . As long as the windows are rolled up , the background sound is minimal & those I talk to say they can hear me just fine . It keeps your eyes & focus on the road , where it should be , yet you can hear your caller clear as day.I like that it makes noise when you turn it off/on , so that you do n't forget & leave it on for hours after you exit your car . I do n't find the blue flashing light distracting at all . You can used to it . However , I do n't drive at night very often , so I ca n't say much about the light in that situation.This is an easy device that saves your ear from the annoyance of regular bluetooth headset . It can be transferred from car to car easily and used on several phones at once.You ca n't go wrong with this one . Works great !	1
I got this for my brother and he uses it all the time in the car . When he calls he always sounds clear and I ca n't even tell I am on speaker phone . He also says the sound quality is great . I would recommend this to anyone .	1
this little bluetooth speakerphone is a good choice to amplify the conversation at home , even in the party , and carry it in the pocketthe plus is USB charging , that I can use any USB power supply to chargethe only minus is , I ca n't put it too close , or the sound is cut offother than that , I am mostly happy with it	1
During my research , I could not find one bluetooth car kit where the number of satisfied customer reviews was overwhelming . I was tempted to purchase a Sony Ericsson HCB-100 since I have a Sony Ericsson K790A , but opted not to because it was half-duplex and I would have to order it . I wanted a full duplex speakerphone that could be purchased from a brick and mortar store in case I wanted to return it because it sucked that bad.Despite reading the poor reviews here , I took a calculated risk in purchasing the T305 from a local Best Buy . Calculated as in I was banking on Motorola 's reputation to not steer me wrong.It has been a day so far and I can say that I am satisfied . I can hear the caller clearly , vice versa . My girlfriend event commented how I sounded better than my Plantronics 640 headseat . It makes me wonder about the poor reviews in that regard . My SWAG is that the phone and bluetooth connection makes up 50 % of the whole . If the phone is crappy or the bluetooth connection is flaky , then of course it is going to suck . Of course , it is also inevitable for lemons to get past manufacturing QA.The reason why I gave it a 4-stars and not a 5 is because of the other negatives that have been mentioned already:1- big blinking blue light , but that 's trivial because I can tune it out like I tune out my girlfriend ; 2- no wall charger , but that 's also trivial because I already have at least a couple mini-USB chargers from other devices I have ; 3- I can not get the voice dialing working , but that 's ok because I bought the car kit to answer calls , not make them.It may seem like I am justifying the negatives , but ultimately they really do not bother me such that it is a deal breaker . Your mileage and tastes may vary.Oh yeah , I use the car kit in an automobile with an aftermarket ( read : loud ) exhaust .	1
I purchased Motorola T305 while I was using Motorola Razor and it was working perfectly . Considering you can not really have a private conversation in the car while on the speaker if there is another person in the car , and if you can live with that Motorola T305 is the best thing to have in the car.However , I had to buy Blackberry ( Perl ) so I could synchronize up with my work emails and Motorola T305 sound quality was bad , there always was static noise interference .	1
I was looking for a replacement for my bluetooth headset when I started looking at bluetooth speakerphones . After doing some research , I was looking for the following : * No installation - I wanted to use it in multiple vehicles/locations* Reasonable price* Trusted brand* Good sound quality* Easy to useI am happy to report that the T305 does a good ( sometimes great ) job of satisfying my requirements . Here 's a look at how it has performed : Setup - Upon opening the box , there are really two things to do : insert the visor clip which is easily secured and use the car charger that comes with the unit . While the instructions said that charging could take up to two hours , my unit fully charged in about 30 minutes . Once complete , simply power on the device , and it automatically enters pairing mode . I was able to find it with my LG VX-9900 ( see my review ) with no problems at all.Use - Coming from a background of using headsets , I must say that I can not imagine going back . I really like not having anything hanging on my ear ( and sometimes inserted in my ear depending on the headset ) . This model also seems geared toward the people who use headsets because the operation is very similar . One nice thing is that the power button is separate from the multi-function button . With my 9900 , I am able to initiate voice dialing from the speakerphone and with the 9900 set to auto-answer , calls are automatically transferred after 2 seconds . The volume controls on the sides are easily accessible and operate similar to most headsets . I never have to touch my phone at all so it truly is hands-free.Call Quality - All of the above is meaningless if the calls do n't sound good , right ? Well , have no fear . The call quality for both parties is better than any headset that I have ever used - and I 've used six different ones over last 2 years . Some of this has to do with positioning . In the Texas heat , most people have their AC on a high setting . Unfortunately , most headsets are positioned directly in line with the air flow . However with a visor clip-on of this speakerphone , this is not the case . Add to that the noise canceling technology , and the people on the other end hardly know that they are on speakerphone at all . On my end , the volume is more than adequate . It 's really a simple matter of physics - the speaker is bigger here than it is on a headset.Cons - So what 's the catch ? As I mentioned earlier , the device only ships with a car charger . I ordered ( rather cheaply ) a wall charger to compensate for this . While it was annoying , it was n't the end of the world . Others have mentioned the flashing blue light . I have to admit that the first time I was driving in the dark , it was initially distracting . However , I got used to it rather quickly , and I do n't notice it anymore . I would compare it to getting a new car that has a loud turn signal . You notice it a lot at first , but you learn to tune it out . Also , it does not have a display , but then again , neither do headsets . Finally , I use it in a similar manner to a headset . I take it with me when I get out of the car , and I power it off between uses . It 's not an integrated speakerphone so it is n't tied to your car 's power supply like more sophisticated ( and expensive ) models . None of these are deal-breakers for me.Bottom line - If you are looking for a good alternative to bluetooth headsets , and you intended use pattern will be similar to that of a headset , then this is what you are looking for . It has great quality , and it 's easy to use .	1
My wife was alwsys 'helping me understand ' that it is dangerous to drive while holding a cell phone in one hand and talking with the other hand . When my pride got out of the way , I realized that she was right . When I started looking for solutions , I found that the Motorola T305 Bluetooth Speaker was priced very reasonably such that I could at least give it a try . Now that I have it , I have found it to be very effective in terms of both hearing and being heard by the party at the other end of the line . And now I do n't need as much help driving as I used to : )	1
I just got Motorola T305 in after preiously buying the Jabra version months ago . If you are looking for a car/truck speaker phone , this T305 works excellent on both road and highway . The Jabra I previously bought had very limited volume and you could not hear on highway travel even with windows rolled up . I read some of the minor complaints about this product in the other reviews and utterly ridiculous . The on/off button is small but who cares ? As for a blue light not being seen perfectly in the daytime , again , who cares ? You know the power is on because you turned it on when you got in your car/truck .	1
Pros : Good sound quality for each side of the conversation . Good battery life , easy recharging , simple to use . Basically perfect except for my cons..Cons : Huge blinking blue light is annoying at night and invisible during the day . Sometimes it take a second for it to answer a call when you click the answer button . I guess the solution for that is probably to wait a few seconds after answering before saying `` hello '' . This flaw also demonstrates itself when using VZ Navigator , because it cuts off the first word of driving instructions . This flaw might be from my MOTOKRZR phone and not from the T305 , but I do n't have any way to know which end causes it.Another reviewer stated that the `` on/off '' button is too small . When I first read that , I did n't know why it matters . I now know . At least with a MOTOKRZR ( and I 'd assume other phones ) , the speaker on your phone will be inactive when it is connected via Bluetooth to your T305 . With 150 feet of range , it actually stays connected if you are 150 feet from your car . Therefore you have to turn it off every time you get out of the car , or else you wo n't be able to hear calls you receive on your phone . It is n't a huge deal , and something you can get used to , but Motorola should have either made the on/off button more accessible or cut the Bluetooth range down to about 15 feet.Overall the best handsfree solution for talking in the car . The light thing is my biggest annoyance . I would buy again . ( I updated this post after about a month of use )	1
I was looking for a no frills car speaker to use with my BlackBerry Tour that was easily portable between different cars , easy to use , and had good sound quality for speaking and listening . The T305 did the trick.Pairing this with my Tour was quick and effortless . Using it is a breeze . I just hit the phone button to receive a call and my speed dial buttons to dial frequently called numbers . Voice activated calling also works , though I tend not to use that.This is a small unit that clips unobtrusively and easily to the visor for easy installation and removal . The people I call say that my voice is clearer than when I was using a headset . I can also hear them more clearly.Let me address some critiques mentioned in other reviews , none of which should deter you from buying this unit:1 . There is no AC charger , only a cigarette lighter charger with a micro USB plug on one end . True , but there are lots of gadgets you can buy to power electronic gadgets via a USB cable and AC outlet ( I own several ; one of my favorites is the Tekkeon MP-1800 , which I use for this unit as well as my iPod Touch , Tour , and Slacker G2 ) .Also , if you have a USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B cable ( which costs only a few dollars on Amazon ) you can charge this unit via the USB port on your computer.2 . The power switch is tiny . True , but it really is not difficult to turn this on and off ( and it shuts off automatically after 30 minutes when not paired with your phone , which happens when you leave the car and get far enough away ) .3 . There is a flashing blue light to indicate that the unit is connected to the phone ( and my Tour also has a flashing blue light while it is connected to the speaker ) . True , but if it bothers you just put a piece of black electrical tape over it ( though I would not cover it completely so that when you charge this unit , you can tell when the charging light turns from red to blue to indicate a full charge ) .4 . The unit does not automatically turn on and sync with your phone when you get into the car . True , but it is not really a big deal to turn it on.Bottom line : This unit cost less than half the sale price of my fancy blue tooth headset and is both easier and clearer for me to use . In addition , since pairing with a phone is required only once , you can use this with multiple phones ( though obviously not at the same time ) , which is handy when my wife wants to borrow it for occasional use . The only adjustment on this unit is the volume , but that is all that I was looking for . For a `` plain vanilla '' unit I recommend this.Update April 7 , 2010 : I now place this unit next to the center console so that I can connect it via a USB cable to a charging unit by my console that I use for my electronic gadgets , which keeps this unit charged all the time . The sound quality is still fine ( I made a test call to my home answering machine ) . I also like not having this unit visible on my visor lest someone mistake it for a GPS and break into my car to steal it .	1
I have debated which of the bluetooth car kitsw I was going to get . I had seen some with LCD display that looked interesting . I decided to try the Motorola T305 mainly because of my phone . I just got a new Razr and I thought that I would have less synching issues if I got a Motorola bluetooth ; I was right . Synching could not be any easier . Once the device was charged all I had to do was turn on the bluetooth on my Razr and it found the T305 , done.I love the voice recognition also . Simply state the command `` Call '' and the contact `` Home '' and the dialing is done for you . The voice clarity and volume level are good . Everyone I have spoken to says they can hear me fine and I never have to raise my voice.I am glad I got the T305 instead of one of the devices that has a display because I am fairly tall and I believe a display would end up being in my line of sight .	1
I hung on to my old v60i in the hope that Motorola would fix their user interface , this one is substantially different , but the bad features of the v60i remain . The side buttons.As of 5/22/08 I 'm about ready to hurl this from the roof . The UI is just too inconvenient . I 've also had to replace the battery once.6/13/08 Enough already ! I replaced it with a Nokia E51 . On the E51 the side buttons are not too sensitive , they require deliberate use , and all buttons are automatically locked after a timeout period anyway . The E51 is nearly twice the price now but 10 times the phone ( GSM quad band , WCDMA dual band , 802.11g an FM radio and god knows what else that I have n't found yet ) . I have temporarily given the KRZR to my significant other , but I 'll be replacing that and the daughter 's phones with Nokia phones when we change the plan to use the E51 's data capabilities ; why would I inflict on her what I was n't happy with myself ? Let 's do the good first : The voice quality in both directions is good , the talk time is good and the standby time is good enough that I am surprised when it needs recharging . I use it quite a lot and that still only seems to be twice a week . The ring tones are the usual selection but the maximum volume is considerably higher than in my old phone . Signal handling is much better , it holds on to calls that AT & T ; could previously be relied on to drop , but there are still issues where it fails to roam to the next cell , though I strongly suspect that is due to lame network software rather than the phone ( symptoms are that after a dropped call with no signal the signal strength immediately maxes out ) . For someone who travels to Europe the quad band GSM is indispensable , I keep a spare SIM for UK visits because it gives me calls to the US for about 1/10th of the cost of allowing AT & T ; to roam to Europe . The music player is fine , but you are going to have to either buy bluetooth headphones , which you ca n't use on a plane , or buy the USB adapter which should have been included for the trivial cost in such an expensive phone . It makes an excellent alarm clock and is loud as hell.The not so good : The iTap text entry is slow and not as good as the old version , whatever that was called . I guess I 'll eventually get used to iTap , but the old predictive text had some advantages.The Ugly : the joker who came up with these side buttons that ca n't be disabled should be fired . It 's the easiest thing in the world to brush against the phone and fire up the crummy voice entry ( below ) or , with a bit more of a rubbing motion , switch the ringer from one more to another . So you can silence the phone and drop it in your pocket only to find it ringing in the middle of a movie . Or you eventually notice nobody is talking to you and check the phone only to find you have a couple of missed calls and the phone has been set to silent . Somehow . Then there 's the voice entry , the best you could say is that it 's not good . If you brush against the voice button it thinks about it for a good while and then some awful woman say `` say a command '' . Now you have to try and convince it to call someone based on the phone 's attempt at pronouncing the name you used in the phone book . Since I work with a load of Indians and Chinese that 's about as much use as a chocolate fireguard . It was much more useful to be able to program the nicknames.But would I buy it again ? Yes . There are n't many neat phones like this and if there 's another one with quad band GSM too I did n't find it.But if someone comes out with a quad band GSM phone with good signal handling and no side buttons you 'll see my KRZR on Ebay the next day .	1
I like Motorola , they are easy to use , have good ring volume , different tone are very nice and the settings are pretty easy to make . I recommend using this phone .	1
I just bought the Motorola KRZRZ K1 phone from China , I was a bit leary , but this phone is hard to get at a reasonable price.The phone arrived and right away the 7 key would stick and when I hit it again I would get two 7's.This cleared up and the 6 started to do the same thing .Then all of a sudden everything was fine.I gravitated from the Motorola v3 which I was n't crazy about , could never see the keys in daylight .The Krzrz K1 is such an improvement , much better voice , beautiful blue color , very easy to navigate , but best of all the battery lasts a full 5 days on standby .It has always bothered me that phone manufacturers promise 10-12 days and you only get 2 days when theyre new .Nokia is the worst offender.The bad on this phone is the voice recognition , you do n't train it , you just speak the name , but I have yet to see this phone get it right.Enunciating doesnt help and turning the sensitivity up or down does n't either .The phone will give you 3 choices to agree with the recognition and usually all three are wrong , so I have to scroll down to the name I want to call it 's quicker.However since I mostly need tags in the car when I 'm driving I have trained the car voice recognition to work , and thats what I mostly use.Lastly I paid $ 45 for this phone and I couldnt be happier.It 's unlocked , I use T-Mobile and I can use it in Europe.For me a cell phone is not a toy , so I do n't play games , text message or go onto the internet otherwise I would have bought a smart phone , and although this phone has a camera , I probably will never use it except in an emergency , and music , I use my ipod .For an outstanding phone this one ca n't be beat .	1
This particular unlocked version seems thinner than the ones being sold by cell phone carriers . My initial impression was this phone was very tiny . It is smaller than the RAZR V3 in overall dimensions . I use this unlocked phone with Cingular in the Los Angeles area.The good:1 ) Small and cool looking . Most people who have seen it seems to be enamored with its design and form factor . It is definitely an eye catcher.2 ) Call quality is great . The volume can be turned on VERY loud . So if you are hard of hearing or just like to hear loud voices over the phone , then this phone will probably fit the bill.3 ) Speaker phone . Motorola managed to incorporate a great pair of speaker phones . It is loud and clear enough to have a conference call in a small room full of people.4 ) Comes with more than basic ring tones . It comes with several ( around 12 ) musical ring tones . Better yet , the ring tones comes out in a full stereo mode ( or at least sounds like it ) .5 ) Camera is good ( 2MP ) . Although it will not replace your digicam , it will be more than adequate for emergency uses.6 ) Battery life . My informal test on this is that it can handle upto 4-5 hours of talk time.The Bad ( mostly due to it is unlocked ) :1 ) You need to configure EVERYTHING on the phone . Nothing comes preconfigured . This includes the default language , time , date , voicemail , email , IM etc . This can get rather tedious since Cingular does not support unlocked phones.2 ) You may lose some functionalities . For example , I have noticed my web browser functionalities do not work with my cingular SIM card . This is no biggie for me since I never browse the web using my phone	1
After my 2-year contract expired , I really wanted to buy an unlocked phone and choose my own service plan . I bought this one because it looked very slick and small . I just got it connected with AT & T ; service and it 's been working fine.The good : it 's a nice size , very pretty , easy to use.The bad : It 's easy to get fingerprint marks on it . It 's from Hong Kong so it has special characters on the keys ( though you do n't notice them after a while ) . You have to buy special headphones to use the music player.Overall , I think it 's a pretty good deal . You 'll get a lot of compliments .	1
This is my second KRZR . I love this phone . I finally broke my first one , but I pushed it to the limits . It had been washed , soaked jet skiing , dropped , kicked , chewed up by my dog ( twice ) and finally destroyed by me trying to replace pieces without the right screwdriver . This phone lasted through it all . The best feature is that if you dry it out after immersing it in water , it still works . If you are hard on phones , I would recommend this one .	1
This is not a nice looking product but it does what it 's supposed to do . Lights up to let you know it 's actually working or connected to a power source . No complaints . It is what it is .	1
The car charger works very well with the iphone G , and GS . You ca n't beat the price	1
This unit does exactly as it sez . Charges you Apple product for your cars butt lighter . No muss , no fuss .	1
A good car charger for your apple product . It has worked well for charging my wife 's phone in the car .	1
Was skeptical that I would actually receive a $ 3 car charger for my iPhone4 that works , but it does ! Plugged it in and it started charging immediately . The cord is long enough that it can be used while charging , but not so long that it gets in the way ( if you are using any type of windshield/dash mount the cord may not be long enough depending on where your outlet is located ) . I rarely ever use a car charger as my iPhone sits in a charging cradle all day at work , so if it only lasts for a few charges , it 's well worth $ 3 .	1
I liked this item but it did not work for my phone . I gave it to someone who could use it and they really like it . They told me it works very well . Thank you .	1
Works great for my razr and I no longer have to carry that bulky house charger just to charge my phone .	1
I am notorious for not recharging my phone . I am often out of touch with a dead battery . I started carrying my cord to recharge my phone , but I need an outlet for that , and my car 's cigarette lighter outlet never worked.One night after work , I got in my car in the back corner of the dark parking lot only to find a dead car battery . I had left the lights on all day . Sound familiar ? I did n't have my jumper cables with me ( boyfriend had them ) , and my boyfriend was out of town . I have no family in town . No one was in sight in this bad part of town . I locked myself in and pulled out my phone to call my roadside assistance . It began to beep - dead battery warning . I had just enough power to be ON HOLD long enough to request assistance and confirm my location - Thank God . I was terrified of being stranded at night in this neighborhood . I vowed , `` Never again ! '' That 's what brought me here to this product . It is exactly what I need , and it works perfectly.This charger is a Godsend . I get several recharges for my RAZR V3 for each charge of the portable charger . I 've had none of the problems others have mentioned . It fits perfectly in the inside zipper pocket of most of my handbags , and I am NEVER without it . I have used it several times . A full charge takes longer than a charge directly from an outlet , but you have power instantly to use the phone in an emergency . What a bargain for the priceless feeling of security it gives me .	1
I thought this item was going to be compatible with my Motorola Droid Razr , but it is not - it comes up as compatible in a search and I did n't notice it saying the connection was mini , not micro . So that is my fault for not paying closer attention to the specs . I could buy an adapter , but instead I decided to give it to my son for his bluetooth headset as it is a mini usb connection.It does work as described , ( though just not for anything that uses a micro connection ) and is a very reasonable price . It 's small and easy to put in a pocket or purse , and is very convenient . When I got my Razr , my son got my old Chocolate Touch , so I gave him the headset also and he uses it all of the time . He 's used the charger twice now and it works as described .	1
Unless I ca n't find it ( ! ) it would be great to have a battery level indicator on this device . A micro USB connector version would be nice as well although the tiny Motorola Mini/Micro cable works . I purchased this to work on my old Motorola phone but it also works on my new Android phone.Otherwise , this is small , sleek , lightweight and it does work . The retractable connector takes a little fiddling with to keep it from sliding back into the charger - push the button forward and hold it while connecting to the phone - but once in it stays put .	1
I got unit this after I was in a park with no power on my battery-sucking Droid X . As far as I could find , it is the ONLY unit that works in ANY fashion . EverReady has a weird thing for $ 9.99 at Target , but it did not charge at all.It is small , solid and feels well made . The only moving part is the push-switch that pushes out the mini-USB to plug into the charger port on the phone . The light appropriately glows when the unit is charging and charging a phone . It is too bulky to fit comfortably in a pocket for an extended period but perfect to keep in any small carrying bag . It would fit in a typical car ash-tray.Droid X and other micro-USB port owners MUST buy a miniUSB ( F ) -to-microUSB ( M ) adapter.The unit plugs into the adapter which plugs into the phone . It does trickle charge my phone . After about 15 minutes my X went from 0 % to 10 % . Another 30 minutes ( 45 total with the phone off ) was required to go to 20 % . The unit is not made for the higher-powered battery type used by the X . Once I confirmed that the unit will charge the battery enough for use , I did not see how long it took to charge , how many recharges I could get , or how long the unit will hold it 's own charge.Now , with that all said , the only place to comfortably accomplish this is to leave the phone and unit sitting quietly on top of a desk or other surface . While the unit plugged into the adapter plugged into the phone will fit in cargo-pants pockets or a bag , the adapter will invariably and in shortly unplug from the phone . I found myself carrying the phone with the unit in the same hand , which is serviceable and not as uncomfortable as you would think . And it did not stop the adapter from regularly popping out of the charging port on the phone ( it never popped out of the unit ) . Using it in this fashion kept my phone operating at least 30 minutes longer than if I did not have the unit.So , the unit works . It is portable and it charges the phone.I would recommend this because the X only lasts AT MOST a day on a charge , and if you get stuck for any period of time ( the essential time when you would want your phone operational ) this unit , for a small insurance investment , would keep it going .	1
Completely satisified w/ product , price , delivery.I do n't always have access to a place to charge my Droid X , so thisportable charger and a spare battery ( also from amazon.com ) are a must for me .	1
I got this because there are times when I need my Blackberry to be functional and I 'm not near a charger . I had n't tried the P790 yet when hurricane Irene decided to pay a visit . I had the unit charged up when the power went out Saturday before 9pm . By 4pm the next day , power had not been restored and the phone was going below 20 % & wanted to shut down some functioning to conserve what was left of the battery life . I attached the P790 with an adaptor I bought at the same time . In under an hour I was at 55 % battery life and could keep going normally till I had an opportunity to do a normal charge at my office , later that evening . It 'd be an understatement to say I 'm pleased .	1
One drawback of any soap-bar , or candy-bar style phone is that you have to lock the keyboard with some button combination every time you put it away or it will dial the last person you called , or someone on speed-dial when you inadvertently push one of it 's keys . This holster has magnets in it that automatically puts the Pearl in standby mode , which disables the keys . The belt-clip also allows you to rotate the holster into the most comfortable position you can for driving , or walking around .	1
This fits my blackberry pearl perfectly . Too bad verizon didnt put one of these in with my phone with i bought it . Instead they gave me a lame pouch that pissed me off . The only give these nice holsters out with the blackberry that is 100 more than the pearl.bottom line , looks good and fits perfect and great price .	1
The case is well made and just what you need to keep your Pearl safe	1
excellent item and IS an official blackberry case . for the price this ca n't be beat !	1
Functionally , as good as any other blackberry holster . However , my perception is that it is `` cheap plastic looking '' because it is shiny . It has a sheen that may need a little sandpaper taken to it .	1
This is a pretty solid case . It 's very stiff so it 's almost a hard case , but is still flexible . Should protect well if it gets dropped.Both sides are the same so the scanner can go into either side and the cable into the other . The scanner is slightly higher than one side of the case . There 's a padded flap in between the halves of the case that pushes into the other half a bit . That compresses the cable in the other side and makes it so nothing moves around.Functionally , that 's a great design , but for looks I would have liked the scanner to fit completely into the bottom , with a thinner top half for the cable . As it stands I might be able to get a couple other cables or things into the top part so it 's probably a net plus .	1
I have used this case to protect my scanner inside my laptop case going through airports , etc . Provides good protection .	1
My Adesso Scanner came with a velvet drawstring bag . I wanted something more substantial , and thought this case might work . The quoted dimensions are slightly off . The outside dimensions are actually 11.5 X 2.5 X 2.2 none is 3.2The inner dimensions are 11 X 2 X 2 My Adesso Scanner is 10.75L X 1.8W X 1.25H so it fits perfectly . The case opens up into 2 hinged halves . Each half is about 1 inch deep . Each half has a 1 inch wide elastic band across the middle , and there is a sewn-in flap that protects one half from the other when closed . The scanner cable fits in the opposite half from the scanner and there is still room for some small accessories . All-in-all , I am VERY happy with this case. , It suits my needs perfectly/	1
I purchased this case as I knew I would be traveling with my NEAT scanner . This is a semi-hard case and offer superior protection for the scanner . I would highly recommend this to anyone , in fact for the cost of the NEAT it should have been included .	1
The case if very hard and protects the scanner very well . I travel a lot internationally and am very happy with this purchase .	1
In truth , I am glad I bought this case in the event that I need to store or travel with my scanner . However , I do n't see myself taking my scanner anywhere . Since I bought my scanner , it has been next to my computer and I do n't really see the need to take it anywhere.One thing I am curious about is that the case has 2 sides with elastic and only one scanner fits inside , so I ca n't figure out why 2 . Anyway , it is just an observation because it does n't affect the fact that the slim scanner fits great in it and protects it well .	1
I was surprised , it was inexpensive ( approx $ 7 ) and constructed well . Definitely a bargain . It looks great . I priced this item at diferent shops in the area and could n't have gotten a better deal . It will keep my Blackberry safe from being knocked around and dropping it .	1
This case definitely helped save battery life on my Pearl . But the plastic swivel broke after getting caught in a chair handle .	1
It kept my Motorola Krave out of my pocket where it could n't be scratched by stray change and/or tools . The leather was supple and the felt-like lining protected the clear screen.And then one day , I struck my hip against a handrail and the clip broke off . : [	1
Great item for those of us with iPads who also need to scribble a note the old fashion way . I never leave home without my iPad and this most useful stylus .	1
This stylus is wonderful to use , when it 's new . It glides very nicely over the screen . In my experience , however , as it gets older , or perhaps as it picks up oils from the screen and skin , it gets more `` sticky '' . In a few months , it is so sticky it wo n't write smoothly . It is also fairly expensive for what you get .	1
Making a stylus that also functions as a pen is a great idea ! Now I do n't have to carry both in my pocket and look geeky . One suggestion that I would like to make is that the pen cap be able to fit on the other end when writing , just like most pens with a cap . I am concerned about losing the cap and then the clip for the pocket is gone too . A small design change would make this a great product !	1
Previous experience : Pogo SketchTargus stylusEDIT : This stylus is awesome ! No degradation in performance over time as you get with the foam tipped units . Good for writing , drawing and pressing buttons . Pen works well . *Note : If you want to save money , the Targus and Griffin stylus are identical to this one . This one just has a pen built in and is MUCH nicer in terms of quality and build of product . Functionality is the same though.Just bought the Boxwave in my quest for the best stylus . This one has the rubber soft tip which I like better than the foam . I think the rubber tipped styli show more of an effort in development rather than the left over circuit foam styli that might as well tell you that you 're not worth the R & D ; ( pogo ) .Out of the box this thing feels like a small to medium sized pen . It actually is an ink pen on one end and a stylus on the other . With regard to dual function styli , I like this one because the pen is capped and when you are not using it , the cap adds to the body of the stylus as if there is no separate piece.Looks great too.I have to compare it to the Targus or Griffin one because that 's the closest in similarity . It does seem to be slightly more sensitive than the Targus , not deal breaker sensitive but depending on what application you are using , it could mean the difference between smooth writing and less than smooth writing . ( your hand weight , writing pressure and writing style make a difference too ) . It 's about a half an inch longer than the Targus , which gives it some nice pen like feel in your hand.This feels more like a pen than the Targus does , and while that has to do with the fact that it actually is an ink pen as well , it 's also to do with construction of the item.On tests using Penultimate , Upad , Paperdesk , Note Taker HD , and Neu.notes I found the boxwave to perform very well and objectively better than the targus . However , I think at this point that all `` rubber '' tipped styli will perform similarly and it might come down to which device feels the best in your hand . As with ink pens , how the item feels is just as important and can play a role in quality of writing as how it actually writes . In this case , both the ink pen and the stylus function work well and do their job properly . I am overall pleased with this but I am reserving jumping jacks for a few weeks of use to see how it performs after some wear.In comparison to the pogo , there is no comparison . This to the pogo is like a ferrari to a yugo . The pogo being the yugo . I would not mind if the boxwave came in a slimmer barrel and had aluminum anodized colors , but I will likely never go back to a foam tip.Saying that though , I have to say as before , your writing style will dictate which type of stylus is right for you . If given the chance , get one of each and see what works better or try them out in the store . Had I done that with the foamies , I would have stayed away , but I can see that they would work for some people.I think the price I paid for this stylus is good , but I would not pay more since I really do believe now that the rubber tip is going to be pretty much the same . Unless you pay more for aesthetics do not pay more because you believe the tips will be different , they wo n't be . Griffin , Targus and Boxwave rubber tipped styli are identical even down to the silver metal band that holds the tip to the barrel . Identical.I would , and probably will buy another Boxwave stylus.Pros : Good weightVery nice construction and materialsQuality feel over other brands , does n't feel like a generic stick , actually feels like thought went into it.Ink is refillable with standard store bought refills . Included ink works well but is clearly genericMetal barrel with metal ink head . Dual O-rings on ink end prevent debris from entering barrel and keep cap tightCons : None really . Only wish the cap could be fit over the stylus when using the ink pen , but that would create a design issueWill update if I find any issue during use .	1
PROS : Thick and I mean thick ! Using for a Intermec 5200 scanning device for work which you ca n't get a ZAGG forHolds up to signatures , constantly checking boxes with a 9mm lead pencilThe measurement lines for use in sizing to your specific needs are outstanding.PACK of ten for $ nothing in my opinion ! ! ! CONS : NONE	1
Best Screen Saver deal out there ! Do n't obsess about the bubbles most of them disappear in a day or two of use and does n't dim screen brightness or clarity . Good seller fast and efficient .	1
I have n't used these screen protectors for screens of any electronic devices so I ca n't review how it performs on phones , iPods , camera diplays , etc . However , I can say that these are awesome for putting those city stickers or parking stickers on your windshield that need to be replaced annually . Using these Fellowes screen protectors has made it less of a hassle to remove and replace those pesky stickers year after year . It applies cleanly to your car windshield and removes harmlessly in one piece with a box cutter edge . No more having to use a blade to scratch away the stickers pieces at a time as it breaks apart.Just cut the screen protector to the proper size . Stick the car or parking sticker on the non-sticky side of the screen protector carefully . Remove the film on the sticky side of the screen protector and apply to the windshield where you would like.When it 's time to remove , just use a box cutter or flat , sharp edge to pull up one of the corners of the sticker , and you should be able to slowly peel the entire sticker off as a single piece with minimal residual leftovers on the windshield .	1
This is a nice product . I have a nokia surge and film that is made for it cost so much that I had to look elsewhere . My girlfriend has a pantech crossover and needed a protective film too . So this is where I went . They fit almost everything and do it very nicely . They only drawback is it takes a bit of time to trim them to fit . Great product ! !	1
I really have a problem when I read these reviews , not only on this product but others as well , and I have read a lot of them , when people complain when they have n't even given the product a chance to prove its worthiness because they are way too impatient to truly check the product out . I say this because , I agree that these screen protectors do scratch really easy especially if you use some sort of `` squeegie '' to apply them with . Because of all that scratchiness , they do appear slightly fuzzy and not shiny and clear like other brands . But , when my phone is on and the LCD is lit , I see no issue what so ever . My screen is still very easy to read and appears much like it would without some sort of screen protector on . Now , the very interesting part is about the bubbles that most of you are complaining about . Yes , when I installed mine , there were a few bubbles , some smaller and one very large one . At first I was annoyed by this but you have to remember , you have to make sure your screen is ultimately clean and free of debris before you ever install these or any other brand of screen protector . Otherwise , any dust spec on your screen before you apply the protector will cause a bubble . If you touch the `` sticky '' side of the protector before installing it , this will cause bubbles and it will NOT adhere to your screen very good . But , if you have patience like me and loose some of that angriness most of you seem to put forward , I have noticed that within a few days , without me doing any other proding or scratching to try to get rid of the bubbles , the bubbles have disappeared and taken care of theirselves . Imagine that . Because of that reason alone , I will NOT be pealing this one off and trying anything else . I like that it has an extra stickiness and it stays in place really well . The fact that I can still view my screen without any differnce makes me think these are n't near as bad as some of you folks complain about . Now , I can admit that I have n't tried using my phone outside in the bright sun yet . My phone use is mostly restricted to in home use . But , I can say , as with ANY device with an LCD screen , whether it be a laptop , cell phone , Ipod , digital camera ... .anything with an LCD screen , you ca n't see them well outside anyway . You have to admit that to yourself . The brightness of the direct sun tends to fade what you see once you are outside . So those of you complaining that these protectors make too much glare ( glare ? really ? ) in the sun , I say lighten up ! I had a cell phone once that when the LCD screen was exposed to the sun , the sunlight actually lit it up differently and made it easier to see outside . I had a car stereo that did the same thing ... when sun hit the display , it still lit up by the sunlight so you could still see it . I feel more LCD products need to consider this , but we are not reviewing them . So anyway ... I just feel you people need to lighten up and not be so critical all the time . That 's one problem of the state of the world as it is , umungst other things ! ! !	1
these are nice screen savers - very rugged and give great protection . Not the easiest to install with out bubbles but for protection they are great .	1
I have bought these protectors before and they do a really nice job . Nice to have the lines on the protectors so you cut them and make a tight fit . A little tricky the first time putting them on but once you get the hang of it it 's easy .	1
I am using this item since I received and I feel safe with the screens I am protecting after applying the screens protectors .	1
At less than a dollar per sheet , you can afford to treat them as disposable and not be too upset if they fall off or lose their ability to stay on that long . What sells the screen protectors for me is that they come with a grid on the backing so you can easily measure and quickly cut to match the size of the LCD you 're protecting . If you want something more permanent , then go with Invisible Shield or Best Skins Ever . But for the price and their versatility , they 're well worth it .	1
got plenty of shields for great price , grids make it easy to cut in measure , stick great , last about 3-4 months depending on how you take care of your device	1
I love these because they have done an excellent job of protecting my phone screens on ALL my phones ! What 's great about these is they have line and numbers , a grid that 's formed to help you make a better , smarter cut for your mobile 's screen . I even give these as gifts because people do n't realize how much you touch your screen . It needs to be protectedThese are the best and I will continue to use these and search for larger sizes . These are the ones that should be on everyone 's list . Great stocking stuffers as well !	1
You can use this product to cut a high quality screen protector for anything with a touchscreen . That 's awesome . Keep in mind that you have to cut and apply the screen protector yourself . It took me a few applications before I got good at it . Some air bubbles are normal , they dissipate after a few days . Lots of air bubbles means you are doing it wrong . Practice makes perfect . You get 10 screen protectors for about $ 10.00 ( or whatever they are selling it for ) and the sheets they give you are pretty large . I think this is product is a very good value .	1
These are easy to use and provide short-term effective protection for device screens . The plastic is soft and scratches easily , but is easily replaced with a fresh piece ... I find that it lasts about a month ( in my pocket , exposed to my keys and other crud ) before the scratches become totally obnoxious . The used plastic peels off easily , without leaving any residue behind.Incidentally , cutting these to size is simple . The backing material is printed with a grid to act as a guide . I 'm straight-line impaired and can almost get it right.Note ... these are packaged 12 in a plastic bag . When I last looked , they were much cheaper than the precut protectors designed for a specific cell phone .	1
it is perfect for my iphone 4 I use this mount for my gps app works fine and I also use case without any problem	1
bought this for my sister and she rave reviewed this it clips on her vent in the town and country mini van and in tahoe .	1
I was looking for a holder for my IPhone and this one is great ! I 've tried a couple different ones and this one works the best ! It 's easy to clip into vent and it holds great .	1
What you see is what you get is perfect if you like small things , works perfect I am using it and works good I like itbecause is on my air vent .	1
This item comes in handy when you need to use Google maps on the iPhone ! ! It does n't damage anything in your vehicle ! !	1
PRODUCT PRESENTATION - MAIL ACCURACY - WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET . REMEMBER THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ERRORS . YOU CAN NOT ELIMINATE HUMAN OR HARDWARE PROBLEMS . YES SHOPPING ON LINE CAN BE A RISK NOT WELCOME . HOWEVER COMPANY 'S THAT USE THE WEB FOR PRODUCT SELLING ARE EVERYDAY BEING ADVISED BY THERE TECHNICAL SOFTWARE PERSON OF THE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THINGS LIKE FIREWALL , VIRUS , IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM IF THEY WANT A GOOD HARD SELLER . THAT PAYS BACK WHAT YOU INVESTED . I THANK YOU !	1
I really did not want anything bulky . I already hate the fact that a case on my slim Iphone makes it bulky . But I dare not go with out . So I really like that the magnet does not really add more bulk . I was able to use the thinner metal piece and it even works through my case ( it is a soft silicone case ) So this makes me very happy . Again I have a decorative case and really did not want to cover up the design , nor did I want to tape anything to my phone . So I stuck it to the inside of my case and it works great ! No more trying to place my phone in a holder to use the gps . Now I can simply place it on and go .	1
I bought this to mount a portable Garmin to my dash for Phantom Alerts . It works great and is much better than the mounts that come with Garmin or that can be purchased as an accessory .	1
This is the best device holder I 've purchased ! It has incredible hold for as much weight as the magnet will support . Having the holder come loose from whatever you stuck it to just isnt going to happen . I 've had mine in my car for months and it hasnt budged . I have put many devices on the magnet and they all stay strong . The only complaint is the oval shaped metal piece is gold . It would be better for it to have been black . The smaller metal piece is significantly thicker than the oval shaped one and I wished it was a little thinner as well .	1
Very cheap and easy way to hang your phone . Works as expected but the mangent could be a little stronger	1
If installed correctly this works if you have at least one bar , gives you one or two bars more . Installed on front windshield works better the the rear ... Buying more for my other vehicles ... .	1
The cell antenna seems to be working ok . I have n't seen a significant improvement in my signal though . The jury is still out on this . I had to move it because of wiper hitting it . This may have affected its performance .	1
I bought this product to try a give a little boost to my aircard . I travel on a mobile health testing unit and use my laptop in the back a lot . I placed this in the door window and it seems to have given me a 1 bar boost so it seems to work fine for me . I would love to get 5 bars where ever I go but I 'm being realistic , this is a passive device after all , if you want more power go and buy an booster amplifier .	1
I bought 2 of these antenna 's . I gave one to a friend and kept one for my self . Me and my Friend both put then on a Window to help with reception . I use a Motorola Q and my Friend has an I Phone both of us has service though Verizon . We went from either no service or 1 bar of service to 2 to 3 bars . I also have a Virgin Mobile MI FI Internet Data Card and it helped to increase my service from either no bar or 1 bar or service to 2 to 3 bars or service . Both of us live i rural area 's . I would highly recommend this antenna to any one who has problems with cell reception . It also helps with Cordless Phones ( if using the phone outside and Home Wireless ( WI FI ) network if using a lop top outside . You could use it on your car or a window at home .	1
This repeater is simply two different length antennae . Actual signal is perhaps doubled but that 's not much . I get two , three bars in a 1+ bar area . Put one on top of a 20 ft. flagpole . heh . Raises coverage from none to marginal . Not cancelling my land line . Other two are on early model cars . Can talk inside now .	1
I am not sure what I was expecting when I bought it , I guess I thought it would convert the backside into looking like it was metal , but it 's got shiny clear plastic around the edges and it kind of ruins the effect . The back is also coated in clear plastic , though it 's not as noticable . It fits well and it 's remained in one piece through several removals , but I wish it was more metal looking and less plasticy.It is a solid case though .	1
this is a pretty comfortable case . fits phone well , would be nice if the power button was a little more accessible . Do n't see any problems with reception so far .	1
Sleek and durable . Looks great , fit is great , feel is great . All around greatness . What more is there to say .	1
I liked it but would not buy it again , it just is n't what I expected but just not buy again .	1
I bought this case because of the descriptions and the price . I have a white HTC One and it really looked good on it and did n't add much bulk or weight to the phone . I tried to take it 1 step too far and remove the plastic back to make it a bumper ( since that was I was looking for anyway ) but it 's not firm enough to be a bumper . If you 're happy with the looks and do n't destroy it like I did , you 'll live this one . I 'm still using it as a bumper but did order the clear version of this same make/model .	1
I now own many of their cases and they alwasy seem to fit well look great and dont break the bank to purchase . Allows good access to the phone controls , while still protecting vital areas in case of drops . Their service is second to none . Just buy their products if you want a good case at a good price .	1
I really like this case . I got the Frosted version , and I kind of wish I got the BodySuit or something else because the Frosted feel is not my favorite . The case leaves a good lip around the screen and the TPU has a good thickness to it , without being too thick , so IA feel like this would protect my phone pretty well in a drop.My only complaint is that the volume buttons are subpar . It takes a very good push to get the buttons to work , and a lot of creaking goes on in the process with the TPU.Overall , though , this is a great case at an awesome price .	1
Boxwave has done it again . This case is a fantastic case . I just received it so a 4 star rating for now till I have had it for a week or so but for 1.50 there is no way you can go wrong . From past expericence with Boxwave I can tell you I will be updating to a 5 star rating . The grip is perfect , the fitting is perfect , the holes for all the external plugs and features are alighned perfect and 1.50 cost , well you dont need to figure that one out . Already purchased a back up one .	1
Great case , fits perfect.I have the frost case , just wondering how long it may stay that way . Any how did greats , adds little bulk , cut outs all line up .	1
These TPU Case 's are all most people should need for everyday protection for drops ans normal usage.I had a flaw in my first case and BoxWave sent out a replacement the same day I reported it to them . No hassle at all	1
Fits onto your HTC One ( M7 2013 ) very nicely . It was originally a nice translucent clear color . However , it has started to get a yellowish hue . I have been using it for 6 months .	1
One of the best cases I 've ever bought for a phone.Very snug fit , w/o any pull-away around the cutouts for the I-R Blaster/3.5mm audio jack/USB port.The volume rocker is covered & actually functions better than w/o a case.The case looks & feels as if it is actually a part of the phone , yet , should provide more than adequate protection against everyday use & occasional misuse/accidental bumps/etc ... ..Also a great value , as I paid less than $ 5.00 , definitely a must-buy for any HTC ONE owner .	1
This thing is okay , but it has an odd habit of getting stained by my jeans . My jeans do not stain anything else , but the white border is now light blue , just odd , but it does not affect function .	1
Looks good , has some grip to it , does the job .	1
This phone case has held up with time . I bought it about a year ago , and it still looks pretty good , although the color is starting to fade.I got this because I wanted a clear-blue hard jelly case . This was it !	1
Awesome Cover for a gorgeous phone . I have a HTC one in Blue and needed a good cover while actually showing off the blue beauty . This cover does it all . I kind of wished it to be clear on the back too rather than the frosting ( which make a good design ) because my blue HTC still somewhat hides in it . Other than that , for the price , it 's got a great grip , and a sturdy feeling . I love Boxwave for all its extraordinary accessories . You can never go wrong with this purchase !	1
The case fits snug but is also easy-on ... easy-off . Provides good protection and looks nice on the phone . VERY fast shipping .	1
I wanted a spare adapter but the Motorola OEM model cable is no longer available . I bought a different brand and it turned out to only play music in mono . This no-name adapter cable has the same dimensions as my original Motorola one.Worked fine although the jack feels a little loose going into the headphone port of my cellphone . With this adapter , I could hear music coming out of both sides of my ear buds . Recommended .	1
Not much to say , it works and sounds great , the wire is a little thin and makes me worry about its longevity .	1
This is a decent adapter for the price . It works as described . Its construction is somewhat light but for the price , you can buy a few as spares . The 2.5mm TRRS male is not a right angle , but more like a 45 . I recommend .	1
This rating is low because product could have been purchased in the US . Nothing special about this purchase . Wished I had researched first ; long shipping wait but its an ok product to have . Priced cheap .	1
Products like these work so rarely , so it 's nice to know that this one does . If you have a big three-ring headset ( 3.5mm stereo and mic ) that you need to go into a small three-ring headset hole ( 2.5mm ) , this will do it !	1
I bought this product for a former phone I had . I had the phone for a very short duration of time so ended up not really using this product . On another note it did arrive on time and proved to be a reliable product for the limited amount of time that I used it	1
to use with my xbox 360 controllers . I wanted to use my own standard 3.5mm headset that I am comfortable with and not the standard 'drive thru ' style that comes with the xbox controllers . Mic and mono earpiece work perfectly .	1
It does what it says it does and did a great job . Did not have any problems with it for my old palm phone at all .	1
This adapter is precisely what I needed to let me use my smartphone-style headphones with my DECT phone at home . Sound is clear , though I would n't expect it to be otherwise unless the manufacturer really did something wrong.I 'm not sure if different vendors here sell slightly different versions , so I 'm just pointing out that I got this product via AFC-HOUSTON .	1
Very light and comfortable . Easier to place and stay in my ear than 900 series .	1
I am no expert on these headsets , this is the first one I have ever bought . That being said , I think this one is great . I have a Samsung phone and I was never really pleased with the way the mic picked up my voice and often people would complain of not being able to hear me but with this made my voice clear and understandable . I was worried of the background noise by the nature of the bluetooth but the AudioIQ seems to do an excellent job keeping the noise out , not sure how . It is simple to set up as well . Overall I am really pleased with this . Highly Recommended !	1
I purchased Plantronics 665 headset to replace BlackBerry 655+ by Plantronics that went through washing machine ( but surprisingly still worked fine after drying ) . My wife also has one of these and she loves it.I like 665 as much as I like 655+ . The fit is comfortable and secure with the ear loop . The sound quality is good on both ends . The battery life is sufficient for me I charge it once every two-three days.The only complaing is that the buttons are a bit hard to press . When I push the main button the ear tip gets pushed into my ear which is not very pleasant.Overall , this is a great headset at a good price .	1
The earpieces do n't go as far into the ear as my etymotic earlpugs , so I have to use the wire hook it came with to stabalize it . I wish the in-ear part gripped my ear a little better . Also , the hook falls off easily when it 's in my pocket . I wish there was a more permanent way to attach it . Also , there are some CRAZY big ear gels in there . I have big ears ( har har ) and I use the smallest one . WHOS ears are big enough for the large attachments ? Having said that , the headset is a winner . It 's LOUD ! I actually have to turn it down . Reception is good and it pairs with my L2 quickly and easily . No problems hearing other people or them hearing me.Last thing ... it pairs up with my Mac G4 no problems . System sounds go through it and that 's pretty cool ! I give it a 4 out of 5 .	1
I bought this Plantronics headset for my husband to supplement my ownPLANTRONICS DISCOVERY 925when we were taking a trip in two separate cars so we could communicate safely on the road . He had not previously used a bluetooth device , and I wanted to make sure that he could answer his phone without taking his eyes off the road . Both of us were using the new iPhone 4 . So how did the Discover 665 compare to the 925 ? In general , it worked well , with easy pairing and one-touch answering . Where it lagged , however , was in audio quality . I could hear him , but he could n't always hear me , and occasionally his transmission had some vibrato and/or muffling . While the problem could have been with my 925 , I 've used it for years without such issues . He has since used it to answer calls from our land line , and occasionally the sound quality just is n't there.So why four stars ? Well , it is comfortable enough to wear ( without the ear hook ) for hours , if necessary , and most of the time it works well , with no noticeable audio defects . Plus , for the price level , it works much better than anything I ever had from Motorola . It 's easy to find the buttons to answer/hang up and adjust the volume . I consider this a good choice for a budget bluetooth device , although people who plan on using one every day for important calls will probably want to upgrade to a more expensive model. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann	1
Great form factor - comfortable - excellent sound quality and noise cancellation . 3.5 to 4 hours talk time might not be enough . Portable charging station is cool - car charger included - also cool . Highly recommend this .	1
Purchased this newer model to be compatible with my BlackBerry 8830 . I 've found that this newer model is much clearer than a previous one I owned . It also stays in my ear better - does n't sag . It 's also very inconspicuous since it 's so small . Personally , I do n't like those headsets that are bulky and tell everyone that you have a headset on . Highly recommend this item .	1
perfect for traveling . perfect for home use . perfect for music from a computer with the usb cable that it comes with .	1
I bought these accessories primarily for the USB data cable , which works fine . I was able to load the LG driver for my phone from the CD that came with the accessories . I use BITPIM to load contacts , etc from my computer . The home charger is a plus , since I travel a lot .	1
Just received today , I will be testing them and updating my review soon . Just wanted to get the word out that these will fit the LG LX570 Musiq . I am curious to see if the data cable ( and software ) does more than the one that is included with the Musiq ( ringtones , etc ) .	1
This was a great deal ! All the products worked and it saved me at least $ 50 compared to purchasing at VW !	1
I agonized over getting this phone for several months , mainly because of what people were saying about the weak battery . But boy were they wrong . This phone rocks . The battery is easily holding its charge , the reception is great , the phone is very cool , the screen fabulous , the features unbeatable . Basically , the NOKIA N75 is a `` smart phone '' , which means it comes loaded with tons of applications . In addition , AT & T/Nokia also provide a CD disk , as well as a data cable . ( Motorola does not ! ) Sure , it 's a little fatter than my wife 's RZR V3xx , but it is n't as long , and yes , it 's bigger than the KRZR which I dumped because the first one was DOA and the 2nd started going bad after only one week . But this thing is dynamite . It 's easy to read the screen , it has tons of applications , and the most important thing ... it works as a phone ! I mean , come on , is n't that the main reason we get cell phones anyway ? We want to talk on them . And this is easily the best cell phone I have ever had . Run , do n't walk , to get yourself one of them .	1
For all those u have been having problems with the phone turning ON when in your pocket and who din know how to lock your keys that are outside ... here is the solution ... when u press the power button u get an option to lock keypad ... select to lock the keypad and that way you dont have to worry about battery draining when in your pocket ... i do accept the fact that the battery life on the N75 is not as great as any other Nokia phone ... But I thot locking the phone in my pocket saves me a lot of battery ... I charge my phone everyday : ( ... But overall it is an excellent phone ... U dont get such a good phone being offered by any provider for FREE ...	1
I had the N75 about two weeks and here is my report : o I find the loose-fitting lid an irritant . Maybe other ( ' ) s don't.o Mine does n't make any funny internal sounds.o Mine does n't get hot.o Mine does n't drop calls.o No stero bluetooth.o Mine seems to do a good job of voice recognition.o It bluetooths to my Moto H500 quickly , and the voice recognition worksfine there also.o The surface does soak up finger prints.o The display screens are spectacular.o I like the large buttons on the key pad.o Large screen , large buttons = large phone , I guess.o The battery goes flat pretty fast ( one day ) , but I 'm constantlyplaying with the phone . Maybe when the newness wears off , It'lldo better.o The pop-port is a pain ; also , they should have put it on the topor bottom.o Transferring pictures , music and application using the pop-portis a breeze . It 's quicker than screwing with the microSD.o Speaker are loud enough.o Being able to load different application is neat.o The pictures seem plenty sharp for a 2 Mega-pixel . If you blow themup , they become pixelated ( see submitted pictures ) .o I 'm going to keep it and hope for a battery solution , or learn tolive with it .	1
It is exactly an oem product.The seller eforcity shipped out same day , item arrived in perfect condition . Thank you !	1
I 've had it for a month and now I get more talk time thanks to this battery .	1
This battery was for my daughter 's phone and it worked . She can now make calls and the battery last much longer	1
My battery was slowly dieing on me so I purchased this one..It has worked great since the day I put it in the phone and am still using it a year later . Highly recommend .	1
These are perfect to have as `` extra '' if you use your phone a lot or have kids who do - good price/shipping .	1
I have to say this is prolly the best bluetooth headphone out there , but also the most expensive . I had bought mine through Verizon with a 25 % corp. discount , which came out to $ 90 . If I had know Amazon carried it , I would of purchased through Amazon and saved about $ 7 on tax.I paired it with my LG Voyager and it works fine and it even works all the way across the gym . The sound quality is good , but the volume on the unit is not loud enough.I have heard many people complain that the unit is not water resistant , I have not jogged with it yet , but will found out later . Great product with good looks .	1
I 've been looking for a long time to buy Bluetooth stereo headphones for the workouts in the gym - I got tired of having to deal cords that would get tangled up during the workouts or would become a mess in the gym bag . When this model came out I jumped at the opportunity to buy them since they were the first stereo Bluetooth headset with a form factor that is appropriate for wearing in public . ( Most of the other ones are too big and just scream `` Look at me , I am a dork ! '' ) And since I bought them a little over a year ago , I have been extremely satisfied with them - for the most part . Here are a few pros and cons that I have come up with.Pros:1 . Comfortable enough for a daily workout . Even with my moderately large head , I did not have much of a comfort issue with wearing them every day for a couple of hours . I would not recommend wearing them for more than three hours in a row though . But that would be the case with most headphones anyways.2 . Easy setup . I had no problem connecting them to either my cell phone/mp3 player or my laptop.3 . Decent range . As long as there is an uninterrupted line of sight between the linking device and the headset , you can use them on the other side of a large room or a smaller gym . Comes in handy when working out and do n't want anything attached to any part of your body.4 . Decent music playback sound.5 . Decent battery life . For a relatively small device like this one , it was pleasing to find out that it did not have to be recharged more than a couple of times a week with standard use.6 . As a phone earpiece it is useful to have around the head headset because it improves stability a lot . All of my other earpieces fall out of my ears way too easily.7 . Being transferred from the mp3 player to the phone when receiving an incoming call is really useful and cool.Cons:1 . It would be really useful if these headphones were collapsible . In that case they could be taken with you in your pocket almost anywhere you go . Plus , it would avoid dangers of having them twisted while stored in your bag.2 . Touch-sensitive controls are too sensitive and very , very small . It took me a while to get used to them.3 . The stereo feature works only for music . When using them for calling , only the left earpiece delivers sound , which is sort of weird . This takes some time to get used to.4 . For some reason , when I linked them to my laptop , they got de-linked with my cell-phone . I had to go through the whole process again to have them back in the desired configuration.Unfortunately , a week ago one of the touch-sensitive controls broke , and now I ca n't increase the volume . This is really annoying because other than that they still work great . I tried sending them back to Motorola , but apparently they do n't fix products that are bought through Amazon , EVEN WHEN THEY ARE BRAND NEW ! This is extremely annoying to say the least . I decided to buy a new pair , and found another one on Amazon for $ 50 . ( So if at the moment all the available ones are more expensive than that , you may want to wait a bit . ) Since this price is about 2.5 times cheaper than what you could get in any AT & T ; store , it seems to me a worth-while investment . I figured that paying about $ 50 a year for something that I get to use every day is worth it .	1
I have a dash t-mobile phone and it work great with it .. i also have connect it to my computer and used it there with a blue-tooth adapter.. plus the sound is great .. plus everybody hears me perfect even while biking .. and while its raining.. even though.. i have n't used it so much while raining about once or twice.. plus over all i have n't had a problems so far ( A month and a week of having it ) .. just more to say u can find it cheaper on other web sites.. ( $ 89.99 ) well get it if ur a outdoor type of person.. Yup ! for sure its a great blue-tooth over all ... .	1
first off , you got ta be careful not to get duped by counterfeit headsets . i 've learned the hard way myself and suspect this might be part of the problem people are having . another might be inadequate bluetooth in the cell phone itself . in any case this S9 works perfectly with my LG Voyager from Verizon . music sound quality is superb for small headphones . pairs easily . works flawlessly indoors . outside , the occasional static , but far less than my H700 headset . when i talk to people on the phone they say they like how i sound on the S9 better than on my H700 . better call quality and clarity . for calls , the left headphone becomes the ear piece and the right doubles as the mic . you can leave it in your ear and people will hear you perfectly , even in loud locations . i 'm soft spoken yet everyone hears me great on the S9 . for music , you can skip forward and back to other tracks right from the headset controls , adjust volume and answer calls . all and all , i do n't agree with the negative reviews some have given it . this is an awesome headset that works better than expected . glad i got it ! ! ! !	1
I love these headphones the ear buds have a much better sound and bass response than my other over the ear bluetooth headphones.I 'm 100 % satisfied , even with the price it 's a worthwhile investment.Not being tethered to my phone-mp3 player is a big plus.I use them with an LG VU . Awesoe ! ! ! !	1
This device works great . It syncs in a second with any bluetooth phone , computer , mp3 player , or other device . The sound quality is incredible . The controls allow you to adjust the volume , pause , fast forward or rewind , go to the next song or the previous one . Incoming phone calls will beep and you can pause the music and answer the call just by touching a button . there are two different types of earpieces that slide on so you can customize your fit . The unit is water resistant and very tough . I use it while biking or just around the house as it is very light and NO CORDS ! Works perfectly . I highly recommend it . Cons : none . do yourself a favor and buy one , you won ; t be disappointed .	1
I 'll first start out by saying that I absolutely love these headphones . I never really thought that I 'd be so happy going with a cordless headphone , but the convenience factor is amazing . When I 'm in our small office , I can leave my BlackBerry sitting on my desk , and walk anywhere in the office , fill up my coffee , go to the fridge , and never drop out . Sound quality is relatively good , about what you 'd expect from a headphone that is oriented towards an active lifestyle that is making some compromise on design for sound quality.The buds that will come installed are garbage . Do n't even bother with them , they hurt my ears after wearing for a short period of time . Make sure you put the rubber ones that are symmetrical on . My buddy bought a `` white box '' kit from another vendor who was selling for much cheaper , and they did n't come with any of the accessories , so be careful where you buy ! In regards to dropping out . Strangely , with my phone on my hip , the signal does sometimes drop out . Very intermittent , talking like a fraction of a second , but of course noticeable when you 're playing music.The protrusion of the headphones from the back of the head is very pronounced . They are a snug fit going around your head , some people complain that they do n't think that they will be able to get them on . I have a big head ( self proclaimed ) and I have no issues with that . I ca n't sit back on the sofa with them on because of the protrusion . Likewise , this means you ca n't bench press wearing these headphones.The headphones also double as a hands free headset . The mic is back near the earpiece . I did n't think that it would pick up speech very well , but it does quite a good job as a handsfree device as well . I do n't recommend driving with it of course , I use it at the office . The BlackBerry rings in the earpiece when listening to music to alert you to a call . Another caveat is that there is no notification in the headset when you receive an email.I 've had great success pairing these with the Jabra A120S . I actually hooked up the Jabra to the audio out on my LCD TV so I can listen to the TV ( ie . play on the Wii ) without disturbing others . My wife uses it for the same purpose while on the treadmill so she does n't need to blast the volume . I used the A120 on a Creative Vision with these headphones as well . No complaints . Now that I have an iPod ( wake up Apple - give us BT ) I 'll use the A120 for pairing when I need this style headphone.Overall the cordless convenience is very nice . They could use some refinement , but they are a nice addition to your headphone collection . I would not classify them as an audiophile headset , but an active headset that can take some light abuse .	1
Great headset ! Comfortable . Good quality sound . My main issue is the control buttons -- WAY too sensitive ! By the time I 'braille ' around to figure out how to skip to the next track I have skip through an entire album of tracks . Still the best A2DP headset that I have found to use while running .	1
These headphones sound very good and the convenience of wireless is a real plus . I like headphones but the cord can be annoying , especially when it catches on something . With these cordless headphones , that annoyance is gone , replaced by an occasional amazement at how nice it is to be cordless and how well they work . They can play surprisingly convincing rock or classical music at higher volumes ( though I usually listen at low-to-mid volume ) .I connect to an iPod ( through a Jabra bluetooth adapter ) and a Motorola phone , which works very well . The links are easy to establish or restart and I have experienced almost no interference or dropping-out of the signal . Using an adapter means you can not control the iPod with the S9 buttons but that is a minor nuisance ( though it would be nice if a new iPod had that capability ) . The S9 does not play stereo directly from a Macintosh computer currently but Apple 's new operating system ( Leopard ) is rumored to provide that capability . The rechargeable battery in the S9 last many hours ; the first charge lasted only about 3 hours , subsequent charges have lasted 5 hours or so.I have only one reservation and one wish : although they are comfortable , they do eventually hurt after many hours of non-stop wearing and I wish they were more sound-isolating ( in-ear ) .	1
40 days into using the headphones I have the same problem as many other users - the touch controls stopped working . I ca n't change the volume ( It 's stuck all the way on low ! ) or change songs . Since I 'm past the 30 day return period , I 'm stuck . I 'll have to sent them to Moto . Hopefully in warranty.New review - ZERO stars.Following is the original review ... .I 've been using the headset for a week , pretty much non-stop . The sound clarity is amazing . No , they 're not the same as high-end audiophile quality headphones - after all the speakers are really , really tiny ! The bass suffers , but they are equivalent to any other compact headphones - minus the cables.I paired these with my Chocolate cell phone in seconds and was playing music the next minute . Seamless control of the playlist and volume . Yes , you have to use a playlist - that 's a function of the player , not the headphones . The thing charges from the provided AC adapter or from a USB port - handy ! Since the bulk of the headset is behind the neck , the headset gets in the way on some sets . Lat pull-downs or good mornings for example . Tilting the head down helps this , or making sure the bar lands more on the shoulders - but this really effects the rep . I tried it a couple of routines and had pretty bad neck pain the next day . So for those reps , the headset comes off.The soft touch buttone took some getting used to , but after a few fumble-finger attempts I got the hang of it . The distance - well , I was in the gym and walked 20 steps from my gym bag ( that 's where the cell phone was ) - never lost the signal ! The gym is the primary reason for purchasing these . I ruined too many compact headsets over the years and finally stopped using them . The wires would get tangled on the weight bench , it was a pain doing anything overhead , and upright rows were downright dangerous ( my thumbs and elbows would snag the wires . ) There are occational 1/4 second drop outs - walking into and out of Home Depot for example - they have a lot of Bluetooth devices running . Sometimes in the mall . If I wear them around for five or six hours I experience two or three of these dropouts , but never at home or the office . The signal comes back immediately and I never lose connection.As a Cell Phone headset - pretty bad . When the phone rings , so does the headset . Press then answer button on the headset and you 're talking on the phone . The mic is on the headset and you have to be in a quiet place . I was in my car , radio off . The person calling could hardly hear me and there was a noticeable echo . I was not even aware of this feature when purchasing the headset , so the poor quality of the headphones as a cell phone headset is not really a negative.As other reviewers have stated , the cell phone tones , ring and sounds all come from the left speaker - not both . I believe this is a function of the cell phone.Overall , I 'm very pleased with this device.Followup : My chocolate 8500 had to be exchanged . Three times . There 's a bug when it comes to MP3 files . More than 50 and the phone locks up . The Chocolate 8500 also required a playlist to work , so the headset had to use a playlist . My new 8550 has no such limitation . I have 450 songs on the thing and no playlists . Now it 's even easier.Also , charging from a USB port . It will NOT charge from my laptop , desktop , or car USB adaptor ! It does charge from the included 110V USB charger . Strange .	1
I use these paired with the nike+ system and my iPhone . I bought three other pairs of `` workout '' headphones . The wires were a problem when I ran or the ear clamps did n't hold . None were a good solution . I was opposed to paying this much for headphones but decided to give them a shot . Wow , best $ 60 I ever spent . They work great , fit very well , do n't fall off when I run several miles , and double as a bluetooth headset - yes , you can answer a call while running . I just could n't be happier with the purchase . Well , if I could find a hard case for them when I travel I might be a wee bit happier , but a terrific product nonetheless .	1
My ipod nano 's wired headphones annoy me when I exercise , so I wanted to find a wireless alternative . I was a little hesitant about buying these headphones and the ipod adaptor because of some negative reviews , but after using them I was happy to find that I have had no problems . In fact , these work great . The headphones fit comfortably in my ear and are easy to take on and off . The sound quality is better than my ipod headphones and is actually quite good . The touch sensitive controls for volume etc . take a little getting used to , but with a little practice they are easy to operate.I am a runner and have used these headphones both on the treadmill in the gym as well as outdoors , including very windy conditions . I have not experienced any loss of signal once the bluetooth connection has been established -- and I have run literally hundreds of miles with this unit . It is a real pleasure to listen to my ipod without wires dangling all over me.Please note that the bluetooth connection between the headphones and the ipod does not take place instantly . Turn the headphones on and wait for the solid blue light to come on that indicates that the headphones are in bluetooth mode . Then ( 1 ) turn on the ipod , ( 2 ) insert the adaptor ( Note : inserting the adaptor before turning on the ipod did not permit a bluetooth connection to be established ) , ( 3 ) select the first song , and ( 4 ) hit the play button on the ipod . There is usually a delay of 10-40 seconds before the headphones make a bluetooth connection with the ipod . Not a big deal . I just restart the song from the beginning.Making a bluetooth connection with my Samsung u-740 cell phone was a snap , and answering calls on the headphones was easy . I had no problem with sound quality.Before purchasing these headphones and adaptor , you should keep some things in mind.First , in order to insert the adaptor into the opening on the bottom of the ipod , either your ipod must be out of the case or you need a case that will give access . I use the latest Contour clear case , which does not permit a completely snug fit ( due to two small plastic tabs around the earphone hole ; you can remove these if you want ) , but snug enough so that a bluetooth connection can be established and the adaptor is in tight enough so that I do n't worry about it falling out , and in fact it has n't happened even when I run over rough terrain in the park . I bought an armband intended for the ipod shuffle , and use the belt clip on my Contour case to clip my ipod and inserted adaptor to the armband when I run . Everything is nice and secure.Second , if you wear glasses , it works best to put the headphones on first and the glasses on second . The glasses wo n't fit quite as snugly as they normally do , but for exercise it will be fine . I found that if I put my sunglasses on first , the headphones did not fit as snugly in my ears , with a resulting loss in sound . The same thing applies if you wear a headband or bandana -- put the headphones on first.Third , since the headphones are curved in the back , if you wear anything with a collar that sticks up in the back , the collar will push against the headphones , which will come slightly out of their position in your ears . So wearing the headphones with a ski jacket wo n't work very well . With a thinner collar , you will occasionally have to reposition the headphones as the collar pushes against them . Also , if you wear a ski hat to run , you will not be able to pull it down over your ears.Fourth , because of the back of the neck design , you will not be able to use these headphones comfortably to lay on your back ( like on a blanket at the beach , a couch in your den , a chaise lounge by the pool ) or to sit in a reclining position with your head back ( like in a car or airplane ) .Fifth , because the bluetooth adaptor goes into the socket that is used for charging , there is no way to use the adaptor and charge your ipod at the same time , as you can do using earbuds . Therefore for a long car or plane ride you are better off using your earbuds or some other headset.So do n't throw away your ipod earbuds or over-the-ear headsets , but do enjoy this unit in those situations where the limitations I described above do n't matter.All in all I am very satisfied with this product . If you are looking for a wireless solution , albeit not a perfect one , this is it.Update Nov. 10 , 2008 : I have now been using this product for one year and have been very satisfied with its performance . However , I am now on my third pair.Shortly before Labor Day , the battery did not seem to be holding a charge , and I got a replacement set of headphones . I see from other reviews that other people have also had some battery issues , though I have no idea how widespread that is.I started going to a new gym this fall , and it tends to very humid where the treadmills are . A couple of nights ago I was drenched in sweat and so were the headphones . The volume control stopped working ( it was stuck on the highest volume ) and there was static coming out of one of the earbuds . Fortunately it was not too late to get another free replacement from the store where I purchased them.I note that all electronic items can be `` zapped '' by moisture unless they are specifically designed to be water resistant . It appears that these headphones are not . It never was an issue for me until I started running indoors at my new gym . Now that I know about the problem , I will just wipe them periodically before the sweat really builds up.Update January 18 , 2009 : This headset does not work with the iPod Touch 2G . Although the headset connects with the adaptor that I put in the Touch , no sound comes out . I suspect this is because the Touch 2G , unlike my iPod Nano , can play music without headphones . No idea if this headset works on a Touch 1G , though I suspect it does not.Update February 2 , 2009 : Building up lots of sweat that can `` zap '' these headphones is only a problem for me when I run indoors on a treadmill rather than when I run outside ( even in the summer I run very early in the morning when it is still cool ) . The problem can be avoided by periodically wiping the headphones during a workout , but I got tired of doing that . Therefore I purchased the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones ( which do have a cord , and which I have reviewed on Amazon ) to use in the gym instead of this headset , which I will now use only for running outdoors.Update January 22 , 2012 : I recently bought the iPhone 4S . This headset works flawlessly with it . No need for a separate bluetooth adaptor and no need to enter any passcode to pair this . Just turn bluetooth on for the iPhone 4S ( make sure you do this first , or pairing may not work ) , and then turn on this headset . Bingo ! You are connected.Update March 17 , 2012 : I figured out how to use this headset comfortably to lay on my back . Turn the headset upside down ( So the M now looks like a W ) , put it in back of your head , and put the earbuds into your ears without looping anything over your hears like you usually do . The back of the headset will now be flush against your neck , and you can comfortably lay back on a beach chair etc . Keep in mind that now the phone button and volume controls will be on your right ear instead of your left ear . I ca n't believe that I did n't think of this sooner .	1
Best cover ever . I 've already dropped the phone twice and the cover did n't even scratch . One year warranty . Peels right off and pops right on ...	1
Excellent for people that want to protect completely their phone . For me is fantastic and the best in the market : Otterbox defender is the best of the best for full protection . Recommended the otterbox and also the seller is recommended : Amazon .	1
it was for my baby girl she like it so she happy with it	1
Simply superb quality protection from every angle . I ca n't see how you could damage your phone with this case on . Wish it was not so bulky , but that comes with this level of drop protection.As a plus , get some 9H or harder ( do they make that yet ) tempered glass as a screen cover . I really like the Spigen nano for the record . Both of these products combined really make for an almost indestructible phone !	1
I love my otterbox . Fits like a glove and my phone is protected ; therefore , it 's worth the money . Protection , protection , protection	1
I was a little hesitant at first when ordering this case due to the fact that the defender cases have been super bulky in the past . Much to my surprise , Otterbox and their Defender Series Cases have come a long way since I contemplated ordering one a few years ago . This case is extremely thin for the protection it seems to offer . The build quality is superb and should protect the phone very well ! I love the built in screen protector as opposed to trying to line up the sticky screen protectors with a few of the cheaper cases . The price seems fair as well . I paid $ 49.95 on Amazon . If ordered directly from Otterbox it will cost around $ 10 more.At the time of this post , the Lifeproof Case for the s5 has not been released . A huge deciding factor in choosing Otterbox over Lifeproof is the mixed reviews the s4 Lifeproof Case received about echoing when people try to talk to you.The belt clip seems to be nice and lock the case into place , but realistically I 'll never use it . I keep my phone in my pocket . The buttons seem stiff , but from what I 've read it 's common at first on Otterbox cases.Overall , this case is a little pricey costing about 25 % of the phone 's cost after a contract renewal , but I feel it 's definitely worth it ( especially when you consider the alternative is paying full price for an s5 because yours broke in the middle of your contract ) . Lifeproof will cost you about $ 20- $ 30 more.I 'll try to update this review accordingly as time progresses ! *****UPDATE : 7/8/2014 - I 've had this case for a little over 3 months now and I still really like it ! I 've only taken it off of my phone 1 time since purchasing ( to clean the dust out and reset the phone by pulling the battery ) . It was very easy and quick to remove . This case has definitely protected my phone against my toddler 's destructive ways on numerous occasions . The only problem I 've noticed is that sometimes the case 's buttons will slip off of the phone 's buttons when I try to adjust the volume . It 's not a big deal . I just hit the button again until it works correctly.The screen protector is still smooth and my finger is able to glide across it effortlessly , which is nice since I am addicted to my phone and use it almost nonstop.I 've talked several coworkers and friends into purchasing this case . So far I have n't had any complaints from them !	1
The OtterBox Defender Series Is A Great Investment To Protect The Samsung Galaxy S 5 Phone . High Quality That Wraps Around Your Galaxy S 5 and has a Screen Protector Built Right Into It . I Have Not Dropped Mine But I Would Think That As Well As It Is Constructed It Will Protect The Phone If That Ever Happens . Great Item And Well Worth The Money That They Are Sold For .	1
Case is large , certainly , but as are all cases of this type . It fits well , even with a third-party wireless charging card inside the battery compartment . I would n't say it exactly looks good though . If you 've had an Otterbox , it looks like the rest , you 're sacrificing appearance and size for protection . I got it mainly because it comes with a belt clip , and the GS5 is a pretty big phone to carry in your pocket , especially as the days get warmer.It seems to attract and hold dust a lot . Perhaps lighter colors would n't show that as much . Personally , I find that big chunk of rubber protecting the headphone jack unnecessary . The headphone jack on this phone is waterproof anyway , and there 's a very big cutout in the bottom to access the charging port .	1
I 've used Defender series cases on two Sammy S4s ( mine and wife 's ) and my older 4th Gen Ipod Touch . I could n't be happier with how they have worked . One minor flaw is that you have to be quite careful with the hard case snaps ( slotted slip overs ) . They are easy to break . With such good luck on prior Defenders , I decided to get one when I upgraded to the Galaxy S5.The good news : same rugged quality of construction on the S5 Defender case.The REALLY good news : when I added the Samsung OEM wireless charging back cover , I managed ( with some effort and a small compromise ) to get the Defender case to fit over the slightly larger back cover . It is n't perfect , but it is serviceable . The snaps do n't fully engage and there is a tiny separation at the bottom ( where the wired charging port connects ) , but , the case is held securely in place by the rubber/silicone wrap around . From the front , top , sides and back , the case looks like a perfect fit . All buttons and openings line up just as they should . Only by looking at the bottom do you notice the fit is n't perfect.The Bonus : The Samsung wireless charging adapter charges the S5 IN THE DEFENDER CASE ! This is the unit I purchased on Amazon : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F358AVI/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1So , the combination of Otterbox Defender/Samsung Back Cover/Wireless Receiver/Samsung Wireless charger , work very well together , with the slight issue of the case not fitting perfectly , but workably . Positioning of the phone is very easy , it fits the charging cradle perfectly and charges at the proper rate ( about half as fast as a wired connection to a 2 amp adapter ) .	1
I 'm not a huge fan of the bulk that most protective cases provide , but if you want the utmost protection then the Defender is the way to go . Fits the phone great and protects it from just about anything mother nature can throw at it . I like being able to throw it in a jersey pocket for a bike ride and not worrying about it getting damaged . Otterbox delivers great quality again with the S5 Defender case .	1
The Galaxy S5 is an expensive handheld personal device that needs solid protection . Even with insurance it is still costly to replace and inconvenient to be down a few days especially around a holiday ! The Otterbox is the best of the best when it comes to protecting my S5 . It 's a bit thicker and heftier than most cases , however it still conveniently slips into a leather belt holster I bought . Highly highly recommend for those who desire the absolute best in protection .	1
I got this as a gift for my son . It looks very sturdy and was a good buy . I did n't realize it comes with its own screen protector so I had bought him an extra screen protector . He is very happy with this case !	1
This is quite a bulky case with the holster/belt clip in place but not so bulky if you just use the case . It does provide a lot of protection so if you have kids using your phone or tend to have butter fingers , you may like this.All the buttons & ports are easily accessible . It snaps on & off the holster fairly easily and stays on & in place . For me , I will rarely use the holster because it is so bulky & hard plastic ; women tend not to use holsters & I am no exception . My husband , who uses a holster every day , also felt this holster is too bulky/hard plastic . I do use the & # 34 ; case & # 34 ; portion . The case is a heavy duty rubbery plastic that is easy to grip & provides good protection .	1
This is my first Otterbox case . I always through they were too bulky and I like more fashionable cases for my wireless phones . Putting this on was a little challenging for me- Had to watch a video on it.. The rubber casing is on really good- But that is a good thing . Now my phone is protected from EVERYTHING.I left my screen protector on and that was a mistake- The touch screen was n't nearly as respondent . I took it apart removed the screen protector and now he screen is totally 100 percent respondent . Only issue is if I want to take my phone out and put in a different case I will loose that protection . But the built in screen protector on this Otterbox works great , keeps my phone protected and that is fine for me right now . Very impressed with my first Otterbox !	1
Still the best	1
not very different from the commuter series . Ports easy to access . Does not make the phone overly bulky . would buy again .	1
The absolute BEST cell phone protection case made as far as we are concerned . My husband is a plumber construction worker and farmer and after using a Defender case on his last phone for 2 yrs , when we removed it the phone still looked like brand new , despite its constant abuse over the yrs . When we got our new phones the very first addition was a new Defender before he ven left the house with his .	1
just recently purchased this case for my wife 's Samsung Galaxy S5 . been using this case since the day of the iPhone 4 ! offers superb protection ! i always tend to take the screen protector off and use a Spigen Tempered Glas.tr with it , great combonation ! overall great buy for those who are looking to protect their device to the fullest ! though they are very bulky so keep that in mind as well !	1
I moved from an S4 with this same series case to an S5 with the case . The S5 case feels like it has a lot more grip . It does n't fit 100 % perfectly , but it 's really enough that it looks really crisp and more snug than the S4 . The biggest issue I have with is that the headphone flap is n't easy to fully close , but it also is n't easy to open either , so it protects that jack well . It 's difficult to take off , but that 's also good in the sense that it wo n't snag and come off . Do n't get this case if you 're often opening up your phone to replace batteries or SD cards .	1
I love the Otterbox . First time I used this product , but rugged and easy to use . It will certainly protect my Samsung Galaxy S5 . Arrived quickly , and item is as described . Will use this seller again !	1
Looks great and only adds a little weight and size to my GS5 . I expect that the case will perform well and as intended .	1
I want to like this case as it has what I am looking for in a phone case . It has complete protection for the screen and the phone itself without the need for a separate screen protector . The case has 3 components to it , the hard plastic inner shell which prevents any immediate damage to the phone itself . After the hard plastic casing is in place , the softer rubber part of the case fits over that and snaps into place better than some less expensive cases I 've tried . The feel of the softer case is great , you will not feel like you will drop the case once this is installed . If you have small hands , and can hold the S5 by itself , with this case you may not . This case adds a lot of width to the S5 , which was already a big phone and almost makes this as big as the Galaxy Note with this case on . I can still easily access the fingerprint scanner , camera , speaker and USB plug . The buttons remain responsive and easy to click on both sides . I use the headphone jack quite frequently , so I would have to assume that continually removing the flap to access the headphone jack might cause it to wear down over time . The front portion of the case has a significant border that keeps the phones screen from being anywhere near the surface underneath it , but again , this bulk is noticeable . I prefer to use a phone case that has a belt clip available and the belt clip that comes with this case is very sturdy . The phone clicks solidly into place and is unlikely to accidentally fall out while on a belt . Overall this case does have everything I 'm looking for : protection , added grip , and a belt holster . The added bulk however is a concern for me that even with larger hands it does change the size of the phone in a noticeable manner .	1
At just under $ 50 , the Otterbox Defender series cases are some of the most expensive on the market - but there has been very little innovative added in recent years . While I do agree with & # 34 ; do n't mess with a winning team & # 34 ; , some phones ( like the S5 ) have evolved a lot , yet the case has not . The finger print scanner on the S5 is very hard to use this Otterbox . Also , it is still not possible to use wireless charging with these cases , which is a real shame . Ideally , a company like this should keep innovating and ensure customers continue to invest in new cases.That said , the protection level is still quite good - not quite & # 34 ; feel fine dropping it & # 34 ; , but I 'd certainly would n't be too worried to throw my phone in a bag . Additionally , since the S5 offers weather protection on its own , the value proposition of the Defender series is lost a little .	1
I got the case the same day I went to purchase the S5 . Case is easy to take off and put on after the 1st time of disassembly . As has been mentioned before the hole for the home button is off by a slight bit . It is n't enough to detract from usage , but Otterbox should fix this and offer panel swapouts to those users who request them . As I work in retail , I know many of these are already in stores . Most people probably wo n't care , but it may contribute to poor fingerprint sensor operation . Other than this , I expect a long time of protection for my S5 .	1
I love the otterbox and feel that it does a great job protecting my phone . It does add some weight to the phone but that is the trade off for being protected . My one issue is that it took several tries to get the case to fit snuggly on the phone the top corner just did not want to take . Also did not like the plastic top cover from otter box only because I had purchesed from Vorizon a top cover that kept it from getting smudges finger prints . The cutouts are fine and no issues charging my phone with the otterbox cover being on .	1
Product is very well made . It is not too bulky and it is an exact fit to my Galaxy S5 . Would recommend for great protection .	1
This tip fits most of the phones & devices in my family . It 's the generic mini-usb connection used by many of my phones , my GPS , etc.The connector fits snugly onto the the iGo cable and fits well into the devices . I keep this tip in my truck in case my wife or kids forget their phone chargers .	1
The iGo chargers and tips are really great . I use this to charge my TomTom 920 GPS receiver . They are just great products . I only need one charger to charge all of my electronic devices . Extremely handy & nice . Works with all iGo chargers .	1
I bought two of these because I have a GoPro camera and wanted to charge both Camera and the battery at the same time without using two plugs . This is a great solution and I love it . I want to marry it . Too far ? Well , its really practical and I 'm well pleased with the purchase .	1
What can I say they do exactly what they are supposed to do and do it very well	1
I have many electronic devices and this was yet another tip for my iGo system . I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family . We all can use one charger instead of having multiple chargers all over the place .	1
This case fits perfectly and looks great , very good quality . The red is definitely more vibrant in person than on the picture but still a great color	1
Alright , I am a guy , and I can confidently say that the black ones belongs to us.My gf lost her iphone 5s and bought a S4 , and was looking for a case.As I was shopping for a case for my S4 as well , I bought one from More ( Para Vertex ) and this back LuxePave black diamond for my gf.Upon receiving the two , I was so disappointed by the product from More which i paid over 40 dollars , this one caught my eyeI installed it on my phone and holy **** . My phone looked so freakin awesome and the fit was perfect.In the end , I stole this one from my gf and started using it . The backside of it has a very nice feel , not slippery at all.I highly recommend this product , if you are a male , get the black one.Great looks , great feel , great protection , great fit , great price5 Stars	1
Not only do I love the quality of BoxWave products but I love the look of these cases . The black you can barely notice the pattern on the lighter colored ones pattern looks awesome . I purchased all 3 colors . The price out of this world . Now one thing I noticed about these cases the back colored panel you see is n't built into the case from the inside it 's actually a paste on piece of material which seems that if your careless it can start to peel off . For the price i got em for It 's a worthy purchases if you were paying more then maybe not . The case is smooth to the touch so smooth that i thin if your not careful picking up the phone with a rapid motion the phone can go flying off your hands . The cover as well does not cover the phone in full it only covers back mostly , sides are left exposes and corners as well . Do n't think you can see this from the pics included . If you drop your phone it 's a goner . Now is this a negative review no , because all in all i love the quality , the look and the price . I have over 15 cases so these I can use when playing dress up with phone . If it 's your only case and ur looking for protection pass on this does not protect the phone much .	1
I like to have a cover that is not too bulky and this one does that however , it is definitely not for protection . I do n't feel like it offers my phone protection it leaves the front completely exposed with no ridges that fold over at all .	1
The HTC One is a great looking phone . I have the anodized blue Best Buy version so I wanted a case that did n't cover up the good looks of the phone . The back of the phone is protected well . Holes for the camera , flash and speaker are in the proper locations . There are cutouts on the right side for the volume rocker and the top and bottom are fully exposed . This includes the top portion of the phone over the speakers . This is a problem for some and I must admit that it does bother me a little when I 'm placing the phone on the table face down . There is a little bit of an edge on the sides that keep the phone raised off a flat surface ( when face down ) . The case adds very little bulk to the phone and I think it improves the grip of the phone . The bare phone is a bit silky and slippery.Typically I 'm easy on phones and do n't need a whole lot of protection . The exposed portions on the top of the phone do concern me and I have to remind myself not to place the phone in the same pocket as keys or loose change . Other than that the case does what it 's supposed to do . I can already see the thin scratches from daily wear and can imagine what that would look like if I did n't have the case on.Overall I 'm happy with this purchase .	1
I have quite a few cases for my beautiful HTC One , and they all have one huge problem ; They hide the phone . This case may not provide the best coverage , but wow does it look nice . I use this case at work , and when I 'm out to dinner . It really shows off the good looks of the phone . It 's hard plastic so it does pick up scratches , but rather the case than the aluminum.Definitely would buy again .	1
I like this case . the only thing that made me worry was the thin section by the volume rocker , but it has held up well . I like that it does n't hurt my ear when i talk on my phone . i like that it does n't interfere when I text . I love that it does n't add any bulk to the phone and still protects my phone . I have been using this case for about a month . It meets all my requirements . 1 fits 2 works good 3 price is great 4 protects my phone .	1
I absolutely LOVE this case ! Its super thin , you can hardly feel it on the phone , the volume buttons are easy to access , and I the top and bottom cut outs are one of my favorite features . The only part I do n't love is that scratches are easily accumulated and I toss my phone in my purse so I 've already acquired quite a few.. But that 's the way it does with any hard case . I got one to keep as a backup and I 'm ordering one of the soft TPU cases today : )	1
I 've used this for a couple of years as a back-up charger for my Kindle or for some of the phones in my family . I have n't had much luck charging my iPhone with it , but the rest of the phones did OK . It 's perfect for my Kindle though.As some other reviewers pointed out , it sticks straight out of the device that it 's charging . So it is n't very practical to use the device and charge it at the same time . But if you 're stuck in an airport and need to charge something before a flight , it sure beats not having any charge at all.I assume they designed it that way because it 's a more efficient use of battery power than a longer cable would have been . Just a guess ... I do n't leave home without mine though . It 's in my emergency cable pouch that I always take wherever I go . I just have to remember to replace the batteries from time to time .	1
very very very nice for the price	1
The iGo chargers and tips are really great . I use this to charge my cool *NEW* Kindle when I am away from power like on an airplane . They are just great products . I only need one charger to charge all of my electronic devices . Extremely handy & nice .	1
This works with 2 AA batteries and will charge a totally drained smartphone to at least 60 % level . Makes more sense to bring rechargeable batteries to be extra eco-green friendly . Not expensive as iGo 's Charge Anywhere rechargeable portable battery which I also own . Because it is not that expensive , I can give this to my son for his camping trips to charge his smartphone and if he loses the charger , he wo n't be in serious trouble . : - )	1
I bought this to replace a lost Energizer USB battery charger , and immediately realized that this would solve a lot more problems than just charging my Blackberry on the road . Leveraging the iGo tips , I 'm able to charge my iPhone , my Blackberry and my Kindle in one nice little device without having to resort to finding my chargers or ever carrying them on business trips . Fill the powerXtender with rechargeable batteries and check iGo 's website for the correct tips and you 're ready to travel lighter and smarter .	1
Here is a really cool item that allows you charge your electronic item ( in my case the Kindle ) from anywhere . All you need are 2 AA batteries , and the appropriate tip ( NOTE : THE TIP IS NOT INCLUDED , SO YOU NEED TO PURCHASE THE TIP THAT 'S APPROPRIATE TO YOUR ITEM TO USE IT ) .Two AA batteries ( Energizer with mine ) are included . Put them in and then put the appropriate tip on the end . Then plug the iGo into your device and turn the iGo on ( slide switch on the end of the iGo up ) , and a light on the iGo turns on to let you know it 's charging . When it 's finished charging , do the reverse in removing it.I would advise everyone to be careful with this , as the plastic is very thin , and with the batteries inside , I think one drop would have the plastic crack.This device is really good for charging a Kindle or electronic device when you have no access to electricity ( outdoors , traveling , power outage , etc . ) or do not want to use a DC charger.As for the number of charges you get from one set of batteries , so far I 've gotten six and it 's still going , and going , and going ... ..	1
I 've had a couple of the & # 34 ; beanbag & # 34 ; dash holders for my GPS navigator . While some claim that those things stay in place , my Garmin GPS slid off the dash one time too many . I had seen one of these sticky pads once before , so I though it worth a shot . I super-glued it to the center of the bottom of the beanbag GPS holder , and it transformed the thing into a secure dash-top holder . Yes , the combined device is now a bit more expensive than it should have been , but the holder was sunk cost . This made it useful .	1
I would strongly recommend . This works great and does exactly what it should/says . It stays in place and best yet , the phone or device does n't stick to it whenever you try to pick it up .	1
I have tried other sticky pads . The cheap ones are too thin and tend to stick to the phone when trying to remove your phone from the dashboard . These pads work great . if they loose there effectiveness just run it under some warm water with some hand soap to remove any dust or debris . Then it works like new again .	1
This pad really helps my daughter 's cell phone to keep from falling all over the car when going around corners or stopping . We keep it on the middle console in our mini van . It does n't stick to the surface and thus will fall off if I open the top of the console , but it has enough tackiness to stay there otherwise . It 's probably better that way so no gluey residue is left if we do n't want it there any longer .	1
it is a little smaller then I expected , but fits my phone well and does n't let it slide any and if it gets dusty , just wash it off and its back to new	1
This jell pad is a harder compound than other more expensive jell pads I have used and is less subject to damage from use . As long as it is kept clean it does it 's job . I bought it because I drive serveral different vehicles during a weeks time and wanted something inexpensive to hold my cell phone . This does what I wanted it to do only with a little more cleaning maintenance . The pad will hold one item comfortably , such as a cell phone . Add an item and it is a crowded pad . Fast shipper as I received this item within a few days after ordering .	1
I use these for weight lifting . The gel makes lifting heavy weights a breeze . I also use it in the car to keep my cell phone from sliding back and forth . You should know that it must be washed once a week because dust clings to it which will make it ineffective .	1
This does exactly what it says ... it works ! I just do n't care for the high gloss black ... I would prefer a flat black . I use it , it works & I like having it & know my phone or ipad is safe from roaming in the car : o )	1
This is such a simple and yet useful idea ! Not only for the car but I also use in my office and at home . Where ever I want an item to stay in place .	1
I picked this one based on the reviews . It seemed like it had the best reviews for the price . And yes , it works , and it works great.The back has a protection sheet to keep it clean for mounting on a dashboard . But it 's not glue-based , even on the back , so it comes right off . Cleaning it to get it back to new would be difficult since it sticks to pretty much anything , but I do n't see that being a problem long-term , as it even sticks on a veritcal surface perfectly . Of course your phone wo n't stay on at 90degrees vertical , but from the testing I 've done , it works great up to and over 45 degrees .	1
I bought a couple of these for my father to keep on his car 's dashboard . They stick well but do not break down in the sun and leave no sticky residue . They hold his phone and garage door opener with ease .	1
This pad works like a charm . It holds my phone to the dash , and the bottom does n't even have any of that sticky residue you would expect . It is too small to fit several devices though , so I may even buy another one . Great purchase !	1
This case is best at protecting the face and back of the phone . If you need all around protection ( military , police , etc ) , look for another case . I like it because of the ease to attach charger , no need to remove from case . It does the job if your just looking to protect your phone in your purse or backpack . As far a using wired headsets , unless you use a hole puncher and seam ripper , as I did , to make a hole there is no opening for them . Fits snug on Galaxy S2 even after months of use . The magnetic closure can come off depending on the rough usage .	1
Product is great . Leather . The back clip is made of plastic . I wish it was metal because the plastic is kind of weak .	1
Most people seem very quick to review this case , but one thing you always have to keep in mind with a leather case , is it takes about a week to stretch out . If the phone wasnt tight , it would fall out a week later once it was stretched out . I received this case about 8 days ago , and after 5 the phone fit perfect . Would be hard to fit my needs better.The only reason I gave this a 4 star instead of 5 is because you can really only put the phone into the case one way . You must put it in , camera up , with the back of the phone toward you . Since the Droid X unlike most phones is fatter at the top , you must put it in bottom first . By putting the back of the phone toward you the camera goes over the waste clip , and the magnet snap closes properly.Thanks for a great , cheap , case !	1
Was looking for this type of case for a long time . I have many electronic I can used this with . And all of them fits nice . They are protective and easy accessible for charging . I wish they cold design one that can stand .	1
Its a pretty good case just had to loosen it up a little because it was hard to slide the phone in and out of the case .	1
Whenever I 've purchased a case for a cell phone I 've had mixed results . Many either do n't fit , are poorly made , or have other major issues . I 've very pleased with this cases . It fits the Droid X perfectly . Not too loose , not too snug . ( like most leather cases , it might be a little snug for the first couple of days until it get 's broken in ) It has a nice , removable and very functional belt clip . You can remove the standard belt clip and underneath is a swappable belt loot to attach it to a very wide strap . The magnetic closure is very secure.Yes , as some reviewers have pointed out , it will not fit if you already have another case or `` skin '' on the phone already . However , I 'm not sure why you would need those if you plan to carry the phone in this case . This offers great protection . It they had made this large enough to fit a phone with one of those on it , it would be way too loose for a bare phone.It is very well constructed with a professional looking fit and finish . It offers great protection against bumps and fall.If you insert the phone as intended , bottom first , you can not insert a charger cord . Not a big deal for me . This type of case is intended to protect the phone while on your belt , in a purse , etc . It is not a `` keep on all the time case . '' As such , the fact that certain ports or controls can not be used while in the case is not an issue for me . Also , having some of these opening scovered helps protect them from getting plugged with lint or dust.Prior to purchasing this for my Droid X , I had used the Body Glove case . It 's a nice case but the belt clip on it is worthless . Also , it offers no protection for the screen , which is the most vulnerable part of the phone.The price on this is excellent . It a great value given the workmanship and functionality.No case is perfect , but I am very pleased with this one.UPDATE I have had many phone cases and been dissatisfied with most . Either they do not fit properly , or they do not last . I had to replace some after just a couple of months of use . After six months of daily use this case almost looks at good as the day I bought it . It has held up remarkably well .	1
No one makes a belt clip case for the iPhone 5 , probably because Apple hipsters are too cool to wear their phones on their hips . But I want my iPhone 5 in the same place I kept the BlackBerry it replaced . This case does the trick . A naked iPhone 5 slides around a bit , but inside a skin , it fits perfectly . The cover is kinda long , and the belt clip does n't swivel , but until someone makes something designed for the iPhone 5 , this works pretty well .	1
This item is great . It is definitely work getting for your phone . The design is just flexible and secure . I have purchased about four of these so far . If you want security then this product is definitely worth purchasing .	1
I am very pleased with this case . It is nicely made and has a sturdy clip . In addition to the clip , there is an additional loop that can be snapped around your belt . I do n't generally use it , but might if I was out traveling . The clip does not swivel , but that works better for this type of case .	1
I bought this battery as a replacement for a weak battery in a Blackberry 8800 . It was purchased from the Amazon merchant Webtreo . Delivery was prompt and the battery looks identical to the OEM battery that came with the Blackberry . I have been using the new battery for about three weeks without any problems . This appears to be an OEM battery at a fraction of the price I would have had to pay AT & T for the same battery .	1
My old BlackBerry 8820 's battery started to expand ( like it was going to explode ) for some reason , and it stopped working . This battery was cheap and was the exact same battery as what was in the phone ( appears to be BlackBerry original ) . It fit in my BlackBerry 8820 perfectly and after charging fully seems to hold the charge longer than the old battery.This seems to be a legitimate replacement battery and works perfectly , it was also super cheap ! ! !	1
Bought this replacement battery for an old phone & it helped me sell the phone fast . Would buy again if I had to .	1
I had my old Blackberry 8830 laying around with an unusable dead battery , so i ordered 2 identical replacements . I received them and charged them fully and let the phone sit w/o usage overnight . Next morning the battery was half dead already ... .To see a new battery lose half of its charge overnight is disappointing . I do n't suggest this battery at all even for $ 5 its was waste of time and money to deal with it .	1
I use this with a regular land line phone . You plug it in as directed on the instructions . To use it you lift the handset and push a button on the earpiece to turn the earpiece on . The sound quality is very good . Microphone seems good , nobody has complained they can not hear me . Volume is adjustable . There is really no detectable interference . There is no head attachment so you must use this over the ear . That would have been nice . Sometimes in a hurry it is tricky to get it situated on your ear correctly .	1
The range is really great and the battery life has been very good so far . It does the most important things well . Here 's why I 'm giving just 4 stars : 1 ) It picks up too much background noise . I was able to improve that someone with setting changes , but it still picks up significantly more than just the handset . 2 ) It suffers from interference with other bluetooth devices . If my cell phone and regular bluetooth are in proximity of me while I 'm using this my voice will start cutting out . I have to move my cell phone and bluetooth to the side of my desk so it 's not between me with this headset and the base . It 's an easy fix , but caused a major issues for a while until I figured that out .	1
I just upgraded to this unit at work . I am on conference calls for up to 6 hours a day and I need a headset to free my hands for typing and my neck from having to go to the chiropractor . I previously used a blu-tooth model that did not have good sound . People were always asking me to speak up . Then if I turned it up a notch , it shrieked.This new DECT 6.0 gives wonderful sound quality . It is as good or better than the quality from the handset . The wireless capability makes this even more convenient.My only complaint is that this unit is a bit bigger on the part that goes behind the ear than other units I have owned . It makes for a difficult fit . I never have a feeling of being able to ignore that it is there.Pros : o sound qualityo wireless capacity / distanceo easy to find accessories - this is a well known brandCons : o how it fits on the earOverall - I recommend this unit for the sound quality , which is the best of any unit I have owned . If the fit were a bit better , it would get the full 5 stars .	1
Just received it this morning and feel strongly that I should write something about it . This is a really nice wireless headset . Setup in 5 minutes . Spend a little more time on 6 different ear pieces comes with it and decided on one with silicon gel that fits really good . The sound quality is decent and is comfortable to wear . It is also lightweight and I can barely felt it . Replacing the ear piece caused me to break one small cushion piece around the connector , but it can be avoided . Do n't think it is a quality issue . The headset can be used for either right or left ear . Overall I am very happy about the purchase .	1
Over the years I have tried so many different brands of headsets and none of them worked like a Plantronics . It feels very comfortable , the audio is great and the set up is a piece of cake ! I highly recommend this headset .	1
I use this product at my job and i have not yet been diappointed from it . i would recommend this product .	1
This unit works great . I wanted a unit to be able to charge multiple devices . I also wanted USB charging ports . This unit fit the bill . It sets in a small cubby hole in my dash so it looks like it was built in . My charging cords reach the charger without being pulled too tight . I have it plugged into an outlet that is controlled with the key so that when I turn the car off the charger turns off . ( Do n't have to worry about the car battery .	1
This works and it comes with the hardware to mount it somewhere so it wo n't slide around . As an extension and socket splitter it is OK.However they missed an essential trick on the USB power supply . If a device wants a smart USB powered device like an iPhone or iPod to see it as a high power source , and not as a data connection , it needs to short the data interface pins with a resistor not more than 200k ohms . That is in the USB spec . You can tell this has n't been done because when you plug in an Android phone it asks if you want to mount as a media device or a hard drive.So if you are looking for a neat way to power and charge a modern smart device then this is n't it . For the 2c it would cost them for the resistors the manufacturers really should have done this . I may even try it myself since it looks like there is room to work in there and I have an electronics lab to play in .	1
This product does everything that it says it will . Comes with mounting hardware . Mine looks different that the one pictured but I do n't care because it works flawlessly !	1
Road warriors with a lot of gear need one of these . Not only can you plug this into your car 's aux electrical outlet.This one is equipped with a hardwiring option so you can place it in the system with its own fuse block and leave your stock outlets free.I did that , mounting this outlet block inside my car 's center bin to give me charging options for phones , tablets , Kindles , cameras , etc . that will fit inside the bin and charge there.YMMV but if you 're starting with this gadget and install it correctly you will have the charging options you need .	1
I like this as it has the 2 USB ports and 2 power outlets . I have two USB power adapters now I can charge 6 items from this one unit ! Mounts easy and is fused !	1
I have owned many cigarette lighter extension sockets in my 40 years of driving and these are by far the best that I have ever seen . I have installed 4 of these in my cars . One of them is in my 2013 Lexus ES350 . The installation is easy and the setup is so beautiful that Lexus technician asked me if I had it professionally installed . Be sure to use large industrial grade Velcro . It is expensive but it 's worth every penny . Get it !	1
This device is really helpful not just for road warriors , but the average person who may have quite a number of devices that can be powered/charged by USB . It can handle and is fused at 20 amps.I have two . On is 8 months old , the other about four months . You do not need to direct wire , but it is easy and in both my vehicles they are directly wired . One went to the front cigarette lighter wiring ( about a 10 minute install ) meaning I have a net of three cigarette lighter 12v outlets , plus two USB limited to 15 amps of the supporting OEM cigarette lighter fuse . In my second vehicle I have it direct wired to the battery main bus with an inline fuse ( from an inexpensive $ 20 car amplifier power supply wiring kit ) . That was about 40 minute install . They can support a high powered laptop , treo , navigation unit , dvd player for the kids in back , and also charge an ipod or bluetooth set -- all concurrently . It is also not difficult to open up the device and and use the 5v leg to run a direct 5v usb for hardwiring nav units.The USB 5 volts is pretty clean and accurate checking with load on car start I am getting 5.1v and it settles at 4.95v , all well within tolerances for any usb device. [ ... ]	1
I wired this in a ground up restoration to move these charging ports to a behind the seat area in a pick up . Plenty of cord for the installation and easy to hook up , you can mount this directly or use 3M to attach it to the surface .	1
I have one of these on my cruiser and my sport bike . On the one on my CBR I ended up cutting the cig plug off and wiring the negative to my neg battery terminal and the hot to the back of my fuse box . I wired mine into the Horn fuse . On this cable the stripe is hot ( + ) .On my Shadow Sabre I stuck this onto the under side of my bat wing.Obviously you will want to purchase some higher grade velcro if you are using it in a similar application.It works well , I can run GPS , phone , and radar at the same time.Works with Garmin Nuvi 13XX SeriesUSB charges my Samsung Galaxy S3Just bend the prongs out some on your chargers to get keep them from wiggling out from road bumps . ( The male end of whatever cig outlets going into this thing )	1
This is so nice . I now can charge up to 4 items at once . 2 throught lighter and 2 through usb . And with the long cord there are no more cords running all over the floor of the car . I do like this very much . You can mount it perm . or with velcro . I bought heavy duty velcro to make it stay up better . Works just great .	1
I have now used this in two different cars , and it is perfect - you can have the USB ports ( and 12V ports , if needed ) where you need them . The USB ports are also high-power enough to charge not just the usual GPS and Smartphone , but even my iPad , which needs 2A to charge.The unit comes with a long cord , and additional hardware to allow various ways to connect it to the car , all of which looks sturdy and functional , tough I ended up not using them - the unit fits perfectly in the space between the front Passenger seat and the center console ( on two cars now - a Subaru Wagon and a Toyota Camry ) .This so convenient that I recommend this to anyone , even if your car does have 12V sockets in the central console . it has 2 of everything , for the couple who has multiple power-hungry devices ( you know who you are ... ) In addition , after I bought the item I received a gracious email from Mr . Dodge , a Customer Service Manager of Gizmoco , the vendor , writing to make sure I was happy with the product and the transaction.As you can tell , I am . If you are in the market for additional car charging ports - I highly recommend this .	1
I have an XM radio SkyDock plugged in to my 2006 Toyota 4runner . The design of the Skydock 's lighter plug makes it very stable and very difficult to remove . I added one of these unit 's inside my center console then cut off the plug end and soldered the wires to the terminals on the existing lighter socket . Have n't had a single problem yet.If you are doing something similar , make sure you take into account the clearance you will need when the lid to the console is closed and something is plugged into one of the sockets .	1
NICE quality . I 'm glad I took the time to look at many of the items offered before buying . This one is very nice and worth the price ! The accessory sockets fit good and snug , it almost feels like they lock into place . There are all kinds of configurations on the market but this one handles the slightly higher USB output needed for iphones and ipads yet still works on other electronics such as my HTC Thunderbolt , and Jawbone . I like the idea that I can mount it with the optional tabs and screws included if I choose to . You wo n't be disappointed with this item . *** 9 months later , as much as I love the features and looks of this product , I am more than surprised at having to replace it due to a malfunction . I looked for what failed and found the plug used to plug into your vehicle power source had failed internally . A broken solder joint inside the plug was the issue . I considered repairing the plug but it 's not possible without removing the seal around the cord where it enters the plug . I guess you could cut off the plug and wire it directly if you wanted too , BUT that 's a pain ! : ( AWESOME RESOLUTION ! After changing my feedback above to reflect my displeasure with the defect the seller contacted me and issued a full refund on the unit without me even asking . Ca n't beat that !	1
Nice light in the sockets , generally works great , would have been 5 stars but onceeeee in a while I have to unplug and plug the unit back in . Might just be a finicky dc socket on my benz ... Ill change it to five stars if it survives another year of my use . : )	1
I 'm using this in my 2008 Honda Civic . The power it can draw matches that which my cigarette outlet can output . This was a little more expensive than the other ones I had found . But it had a fuse and was proper Power usage . The USB charging is nothing spectacular , I 'm using a Samsung galaxy S3 . I have n't tried a full load on this yet . I run a Bluetooth adapter and charge my phone through this leaving me one extra USB port and cigarette lighter in case I need it.It does come with mounting screws and double-sided tape . I have n't used either of them , I do n't suspect I will .	1
my taxi is a Chevrolet Uplander Minivan . The power outlet is on the floor , lousy location . Now I can plug my phone , GPS , and customers phones in and charge them using this . Nice quality build , unlike some cheap s*** out there . Definitely a good investement	1
This is a compact unit that I use to charge my cell phone and Garmin Nuvi 660 GPS using the two DC outlets , and to charge my Ipod Nano and Palm TX using the two USB outlets . I purchased a DC outlet extension cord at Radio Shack , and plug the charger into this so that I can position the charger right next to my seat.I have tried various other chargers , and this is the most convenient one that I have found . In addition , the charger 's capacity is sufficient to handle all of my gadgets being charged simultaneously.Update July 22 , 2009 : Some months ago I replaced my Palm TX with an iPod Touch 2G . This unit charges it just fine using the same USB cable that I use to charge the Touch on my laptop.Update August 23 , 2009 : I now charge my new BlackBerry Tour on this unit.Update October 10 , 2010 : I just ordered my third unit -- not because I had a problem with the other two , but because I wanted one for each car . Three years later my original unit is working just fine , as is the secind unit that I purchased a year after that . This is definitely a quality product that has performed well and held up well.Update December 3 , 2010 : I just received my fourth unit that I am giving to one of my children to use in their car . This is a quality unit , and I have not had any problems with any of the units that I have bought.Update August 1 , 2012 : Still using all four units without any problems . I have inserted a Powergen USB car charger into one of the 12V sockets , so now I have 4 USB ports -- which I need for an iPad 3 , two iPhones 4S , and a Kindle 3.Update August 18 , 2013 : Still using with no problems . We had some brutally hot days this summer where the temperature inside my parked car was easily over 100 degrees . No effect at all on this unit .	1
I mounted this in my RV to provide power for my phone and tire pressure monitor . It solves several problems at once and is small enough to not be in the way . The right angle plug is a nice touch as the plug is just behind a cup holder that can cause space and power issues . I would recommend this to others .	1
I installed this in an existing opening in my dash and hard wired it . After nearly a year , all the plugs are working fine . I use them a lot . I plan to buy another one . Good stuff . One drawback . The red power light . It is so bright that in nearly blinds me while driving at night . I covered it with black paint two days after I installed it.Love it . No more having to buy separate car chargers !	1
If you 're like me , you 've just about given up trying to find a reliable bluetooth headset and transmitter . Look no further . I bought this unit with the matching transmitter ( `` Sony Bluetooth Wirleless Transmitter for iPod ( Black ) '' ) , and have been enjoying clear , reliable music ever since . This headset has a volume adjustment that actually works -- the upper volume range is amazing . The track-changing controls are also snappy ( just flick to change ) . The unit pairs quite well with its own transmitter.Bluetooth is not great for deep sounds , so the bottom range is just okay . But the overall sound is better than any competing products.One recommendation that I am surprised no one has considered : an on-off switch that , once flipped on , automatically pairs without having to hold buttons down . All bluettoth headsets are guilty of this gaffe .	1
These stereo headphones are IMHO a miracle of modern electronics . ( OK , maybe I 'm somewhat easily impressed ) I 'm using them with my Samsung U900 flip shot with a 4 gig . chip..A word of caution : Your phone ( or other storage device ) MUST ! support A2DP ( Advanced Audio Distribution Profile ) and AVRCP ( Audio/Video Remote Control Profile ) to access all the features of this device . ( or for that matter , to even work with it ) ..I have most of my CD collection in my phone and when listening to music the buttons ON THE HEADSET will control ( in the phone ) fast forward , rewind , mute , move to next song , pause , and play , even turns off the phone speaker when active . The head set is quite comfortable ( at least for me ) . The fidelity is on par or better than plugging directly into the phone with my wired headsets . Certainly not `` studio quality '' , but again , quite adequate . Stereo separation is superb..I was initially concerned about the phone working with these headphones as the phone shows NO capabilities of sending stereo music ( or ANY music ) via bluetooth link prior to pairing with these headphones . To wit : to my Motorola H710 . After pairing with the headset , all the functions magically developed in the phone of control by the headset..The only ` Cons ' I can think of are [ 1 ] No fidelity control ( like bass and treble ) [ 2 ] I have n't yet been able to INITIATE a call with the headset playing and consequently give voice orders to my phone..Which bring me to another ` plus ' , however . When listening to music an incoming call is indicated by a tone from the headset and may easily be answered by pushing the ` multifunction button ' on the headset . Surprisingly , the music ` mutes ' and the headphones will then serve as a fairly good bluetooth hands free communication device . There is a mic in the rt . head piece as evidenced by a SMALL hole about 1mm in diameter . I did n't expect much of communication with this mic placement , but again : big surprise ! It works quite well both ways during a call . Particularly on my end due to the fact BOTH ears are participating in the conversation . It is n't as good a bluetooth -phone communication device such as my Motorola H710 ear piece , but close..When the call is terminated , the music automatically comes off ` mute ' and again begins to play..It does take some practice to be able to push the desired button or control on the headset , as it must be done by ` feel ' alone . There are four different buttons , two being a ` rocker ' profile . Easily learned , even by this old man..Any multifunction device most always can be outdone ( on a SINGLE function ) by a dedicated , single use device on the plethora of functions sometimes available . A good example is my U900 Samsung flip-shot phone . It 's a 3.0 megapixel camera , a passable video cam , a very good `` MP3 '' ( type ) player , and , before I forget , ummmm ... a very good cell phone..IMHO some of the negativity expressed in many reviews neglects to consider the INHERENT lesser capabilities of a MULTI function device . Refer to my second paragraph comment ( s ) ..Battery life is quite good . With reasonable expectations and a compatible storage device , I think most would be satisfied with these headphones . Emphasis on WITH A COMPATABLE A2DP/AVRCP DEVICE..Addendum 5/09- I AM able to give my phone voice commands and call initiation . This is , however , the headphones weakest feature . These headphones could stand on their flawless transmission of music alone as far as my opinion goes . The voice commands are a non-issue for me , anyway . Go for 'em !	1
I am typically disappointed by the sound quality of bluetooth headphones but this one is great ! Pairing was easy and flawless and battery life is days long . The fit is snug and comfortable and does not shift around . The volume controls are easy to reach . The only `` issue '' for me is that the bass is not as heavy as my corded headphones - as expected . All in all excellent product though .	1
The Sony DR BT21G is a very good piece of technology for the price . While there may be better , more expensive headsets on the market , this was about as high as I was personally willing to go for something with no swappable battery and intended for serious use.I picked this up as part of a bundle with a Bluetooth Transmitter for my iPod , and it is serviceable there . The real shortcoming appears to be the transmitter , which is not particularly strong.This review is strictly about the Headphones , however , which are pretty close to excellent.There are certain compromises purchasing headphones ; larger , over the ear style ones are better but heavier . Smaller , in-the-ear style ones tend to provide less in terms of quality audio , and are most likely worse for your ears in general.These are `` street style , '' which may not contour to your head if you have a larger one . Despite this short coming , they probably provide the best balance between size and sound . Clip-ons always fall off my hears , and over the ear headphones block out too much noise when I am outside . While I appreciate my music , I appreciate not being run over much more.The sound on these headphones is particularly good compared to a similar price range . Use with a portable media device will depend on the transmitter ; while my iPod and transmitter struggle to broadcast from my pocket , the headphones will receive music in fine quality from as much as 30 feet away ( standard distance for a Class II Bluetooth device ) . Similarly , I can stream music from my PC anywhere in my apartment.While I did not buy this primarily with phone usage in mind , the unit 's microphone is solid and the noise cancellation is some of the best I 've used . My friends usually can not tell if I am at home or out on the streets , barring heavy wind or a semi driving by . Compared to the bluetooth earpieces I 've used in the past , the reception is stellar . Not only do I no longer have to raise my voice , I can speak in rather quiet tones . This was a pleasant surprise , considering this was not the reason I made my purchase.Active Battery Life easily trumps eight hours new ; over time , expect the batteries in a bluetooth unit will deteriorate , and most can not be replaced . Expect two years of battery life from such a unit , with some deterioration towards the end ( depending on use ) . Standby time is a little dodgier , and extended time off the charger may limit usage . If I charge the unit in the morning or overnight , I can get a full day and change , even with heavy use . Unfortunately , this appears to be the only way around the drain on the battery.The headphones also support multiple devices at once . For example , you can run a music device and a phone through the same unit , provided they support the right profiles . I stream music with an A2DP profile through my iPod or PC while also using my mobile phone . This can cause minor disruptions to the music , however . Interruptions are usually minimal . The headset features controls for fast forward , rewind , play/pause , volume , and talk/end/voice dial for phones . A compatible device can be controlled with only the headset , meaning your phone or music player can be tucked away and still managed.The features , sound quality , and reliability far outstrip any problem I have with the neckband . If your head is larger than normal , expect the earpieces to shift around , and possibly discomfort if worn for several hours at a time . When not in use , I usually let them rest around my neck instead.The type of headphones one uses is a personal choice , but if you prefer the `` street style '' to clip-ons , earbuds , and studio/monitor style over-the-ear headphones , this is a great device for the price .	1
It 's an awesome bluetooth piece available in the line of bluetooth headsets . The sound quality is far better and louder than Motorola bluetooth I used before . I 'm satisfied with my purchase . The controls on the headphone is easy to control . The operation is exactly s mentioned in its description , 11 hrs voice and music . It folds so easy to store in bag or sometimes even in my jacket pocket . I definitely recommend this to the user who wants to get rid of wires between phone and mobile .	1
I tried this headphone in an office environment where we can make phone calls from our PCs.When listening to streaming music and news these headphones were great . The sound quality had just the right mix of base and treble . The A2DP profile had no crackle and overall was flawless.My only problem with these headphones was in using the microphone . Since it is n't on a boom it is omni-directional . Often this lead to callers hearing my colleagues more than me , and issue with our phone software modifying volume levels automatically because it thought I was speaking . Therefore , I would n't recommend this headphone if you need to use the mic anywhere that might be in the slightest bit noisy . That said , the mic did pic up everything it could .	1
Pros : Price of this unit on Amazon.SOund qualitylight weightBattery lifefolds to almost half its extended sizeCons : -volume buttons need some redesign . I have huge fingers and still cant get used to doing the volume without looking at the buttons on the right ear phone.-no noise cancelling feature in this model . couldnt be that much harder to add it . im sure later models will have this feature.-BT connection problems . Not sure if its the headphones or my LG Voyager , but sometimes even though the LG says the Sony headset is connected , music will come blaring out of the phone instead . It takes some power cycling of Bluetooth on the phone and headset to get everything to work . Again , this may be LG Voyager issue.-Travel pouch sucks . Absolutely no padding .	1
This turned out to be a Christmas gift for someone . The person wanted a Bluetooth headset that wrapped around the ears , not necessarily noise-cancelling , but enough not to be distracted from whatever was being played . I read a good number of reviews on Amazon.com and my choice came down to this , based on the reviews and price.The person was far from disappointed by the gift . It was found to pair & connect very easily to a Netbook and other devices . It was very light , comfortable , and adjustable . They sound was far better than expected.I confirmed this personally the next time we were together . I own two Bluetooth headsets : Plantronics Pulsar 590A - Headset - wireless - BluetoothandMotorola S305 Bluetooth Stereo Headset ( Black ) [ Retail Packaging ] . I like these both very much . They are very good headsets . My initial opinion is that the Sony DRBT50 is on par with these as far as sound is concerned . It is also much more comfortable than them and easier to use ( the others can be a bit clumsy ) . I suppose that , overall , I would prefer the Sony to both of them .	1
I was interested in getting these headphones because they have a built in microphone , which would be very helpful with the PS3 . Note that the PS3 will only transfer `` chat '' through it 's bluetooth . Meaning , all game sounds are still routed through the television or your stereo receiver.These would have been a slam dunk , but the BT stack the PS3 uses will not allow the transfer of game sounds through bluetooth .	1
I purchased the Sony DRBT50 Stereo Bluetooth Headset in mid June , 2008 . I have used it many times and have enjoyed it very much . I also purchsed the Sony HWSBTA2W Bluetooth wiresless audio transmitter/reciever at the same time . I installed the transmitter/receiver at the output of my stereo surround sound system so I can watch a late night movie without disturbing others in the household . It works great . There is no delay between the actors speaking and my hearing the words , which was one complaint/review I read before I purchased the headset , and this true for both DVDs and DirecTV movies as well , no delay at all . The range is great , about 30 feet unobstructed , less if there is a sheetrock wall . In my home I also have a wireless computer router and portable telephone in the 2.4 Ghz frequency range and so far have experienced no interference at all . The headphones allow you hear sounds and sound effects in the movies that I did not know were there before and are quite comfortable to wear for long periods ( typical movie length ) . I can definitely recommend this set-up to anyone .	1
I love everything but the `` jog '' button.Sound : 5 stars.Comfort : 5 stars.Can even sleep in them . May need some wiggling around to get fully over the ears and prevent fatigue when using for long periods of time.Connectivity : 5 stars.Quickly and easily connected to iPhone , Notebook , and Media Center computer.Technology : 5 stars.Latency when watching video is non-existent with iPhone , barely noticeable on Media Center PC , mild on Notebook ( but improved when switched to High Performance power settings ) . Latency is generally more a factor of processor at the sound source than technology in the headphones.Usability : 3 stars.Actually , everything 's fine until one gets to The `` Jog '' Button which has multiple flaws.1 . it 's too sensative and wiggles too easily . To Pause/Stop a track , it requires great concentration to feel one 's way around to find this button and then manage to press straight down without moving one way or the other and thus skipping or repeating the track instead of pausing it.2 . it 's too close to the volume buttons . After several days of mild frustration , I 've learned to slo_o_o_o_owly slide my finger up from the very bottom until I find the volume buttons . Then I slo_o_o_o_owly find the correct one to adjust up or down . Otherwise , I 'm again faced with skipping to the next track every time I want to adjust the volume . This is especially unpleasant when watching Streaming movies as it generally stops the movie and forces the user to start over from the beginning and then scan to find where they were before their tragic decision to adjust the volume.This control should be moved far from other buttons . Better yet , the manufacturer could spend the extra few pennies on wire and put this control on the left earpiece where it ca n't be hit by accident . Of course , over there , maybe it would n't have to be a blasted multi-dysfunction `` jog '' button because there would be room to separate the functions to avoid unpredictable results.Overall , I love these headphones . I can get used to the controls but having to keeps it from a perfect rating in this reviewer 's estimation .	1
I like these headphones . I bought a cheaper model from Sony earlier , but really wanted to experience the best bluetooth headphones Sony makes . So far , I really do n't have any complaints . The sound quality is very nice ; much better than open-ear styles , pairs easily with my PC , G1 , PS3 , and my Vtech home phone . Using it for phone calls is average , but very acceptable . Blocks out a lot of noise naturally and can even use them while mowing the grass without cranking the volume all the way up to hear it over the mower . Range varies depending on whether you 're using it to talk on the phone or listening to music ; I get a good 20 feet for music ( little or no obstructions ) and about 30 feet using for phone ( couple of rooms away ) for telephone.For me , I 've found the perfect pair of wireless headphones . Make sure to read some of the more detailed reviews here - lots of helpful info you 'll want to know before you make the investment . These should easily satisfy 85 % of buyers .	1
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I 've made in the last several years - seriously . Being a hater of wires , I went looking for wireless headphones , and kept finding that the ones that rate well for audio quality tend to be ridiculously expensive . I ran across these on Amazon , and decided to give them a whirl , even though they seemed too cheap ( as in inexpensive , not poor quality ) to be any good.I 'm extremely glad I took the chance ! They have great sound , good volume , and great battery life . I only have to charge them once a week ( I listen probably only a couple hours a day , and not every day , so take that for what it 's worth ) , which is great . They also do a good job of isolating you from the outside world , and likewise , do a good job of keeping your tunes from bothering other people.If I had to pick out any issues with them , I 'd say that they could stand to allow for bigger heads - I have them extended out as much as they will go , and they JUST fit . I guess I am one with a big head : ) .The only other issue I could pick out is that the on-board controls are a little hard to pick out while wearing them - they are small , somewhat flush , and close together . Still , I 've gotten pretty adept at controlling my music with them.I have not tried them for phone calls - I tend to like to use the phone directly while at work , so I ca n't say how well the microphone performs.Overall , I 'd say these are a great find , especially when you consider how expensive wireless headphones tend to be . I highly recommend these !	1
UPDATE 11/23/2010 : The DRBT50 's now have more ( and less ! ) functionality when used with the iOS 4.2+ software . You can now change volume for the headphones using the onscreen volume sliders ( previously the volume bar changed to say `` DRBT50 '' and you had to control it using the headphone controls ) . You also have the option to output sound to either the headphones or ipad speakers ( a new toggle icon appears when the headphones are on ) which is nicer than having to turn them off completely to use the ipad speakers . You can also go to next/previous song using the built-in controls . You still need to press the play/pause button for them to connect , unfortunately ( other bluetooth devices connect instantly when turned on ) .Unfortunately , this comes with a huge downside.. videos default to playing audio through the ipad speakers . If you listen to music through the headphones and a music video comes up , the sound will come out of the ipad ( you need to go into the controls and change it every time one comes up ! ) Even worse , other sounds such as those from games also default to the iPad speakers.. but have no option to output to the headphones ( which previously worked perfectly ) . The downsides far outweigh the positive additions in this case , and it 's something that needs to be fixed.Original review : I picked up the DRBT50 headphones for my iPad , mainly for peace of mind . I like listening to music on my iPad , but find my headphone cord always ending up in the wrong spot - getting stuck in my chair or wrapped around something . I get that `` If I had just rolled my chair out , the iPad would 've gone crashing down '' feeling . Whether it 's with short cords or long ones ( long cords have the problem of being too long ! ) . I wanted a wireless option that had great sound but did n't break the bank.The DRBT50 has been the closest to that , that I 've found.Pairing is rather quick ( but you will need to read the manual on how to do it ) . Unfortunately the iPad does n't automatically connect to it - this means that you not only need to turn the headphones on , but connect them in the Settings - > Bluetooth option . Annoying if you walk out of range or connect/disconnect the headphones all day . ( UPDATE : I found that hitting the Play/Pause button on the headphones will connect it to the iPad without having to go into the options ! ) Battery life is very good and a charger is included - unfortunately it 's an AC Adapter unlike the mini-USB port that most use.The headphones are very stylish and fold up very nicely ( a big problem with the other headphones ) .The controls on the side are a nice idea , but more trouble than they 're worth ( at least to me ) . They 're small buttons and I always find myself hitting the wrong one . Most of them will NOT work on the iPhone/iPod/iPad ( only the VOL+ , VOL- and Play/Pause buttons work ) . No big loss since the controls are so hard to find ( they 're behind the ear ) . ( UPDATE : The buttons have gotten easier to find after further use - still not the easist , but definitely do-able ( especially for volume ) When paired with the iPad , it `` takes control '' of the volume ( so you need to use the iPad to change the volume ) . See the product image I 've attached to the item page.Sound is very good - I 've heard complaints that it does n't block out noise as good as it should ( while I do n't use it in the loudest places , I found it to block out most noises - not `` noise cancelling '' though ) . Bass could be better , but overall not bad . Not up to par with mySennheiser HD-595 Premier Headphone , but it 's also a third of the price and bluetooth.I would have liked a headphone input jack for those times you want to use it with a non-bluetooth device ( like a home theater ) .I havent used it as a headset yet , but heard it does a decent job.Overall a very good product and possibly the best bluetooth headphones available in this price range . If you need something compact and high quality , and can deal with some of its oddities like the button placement , need for AC adapter and pairing issues , it 's a great little addition !	1
It 's really hard to describe how good it sounds . I 've been impressing all my friends with it 's audio quality ; regardless of it being wireless or not . I can heard subtle details in the songs that I did n't know existed ; just like studio monitor headphones . In fact , they are so clear , I can easily tell the difference between standard mp3 compression sound quality and audio CDs . I 've been using these headphones for days and hours at a time ; and , it just doesnt run out of battery power . It also does a great job of cutting out noise that you dont want to hear in the same room .	1
This blue tooth head set saved my day I can watch my movies on my Ipad when I am at the gym and listen to them on the headset with out wires dangling in my way at my knees an awesome product I really like them .	1
Sony does it again . This headset is the second wireless headset I 've bought from Sony , the 1st is an RF headset that I 've had for going on 4yrs . This bluetooth has great sound quality and fits without causing much ear discomfort , ie sweating during a hot day outside . Only con is not being able to charge via USB . Highly recommend !	1
I have used this with various phones and headsets and it still works 3 years later . I love the retractable cable . Tips are somewhat easy to loose since they are tiny but every tip I have works with the device it was made for .	1
Yes , yo do need to buy the tips for this to work . Obviously it is n't reasonable to expect it to come with tips , since the company does n't know which products you own . I have this charging set and four tips ( Kindle , Ipaq , Creative , and Motorola ) and did n't spend any more than I would have buying car chargers for all those devices , in fact I spent less.The tips and charging heads all fit on very securely . I have not had any problem with either popping off . Actually , sometimes I have a hard time getting them off.I was able to fit all the pieces , including my tips , into the included travel case , but it is a tight fit . I would have preferred some kind of zippered case to go with it . The included case is just a pouch with two mesh pockets . The pouch holds the charging heads , and then the cable fits in one of the pockets and tips in the other . Since most my tips are pretty large it takes some creativity to get them all to fit.The kit is compact enough that I can throw it into my bag and not have to worry about it taking up a lot of space . Could you imagine if I tried to carry all the chargers around for those devices ? It would be a nightmare . That 's what makes this device so useful . It gets everything you need in one compact size.If you carry a lot of devices and want to be able to charge them on the go , this is what you need . But do n't forget the tips !	1
Although the plastic looks and feels like very cheap plastic and as if were to fall it 'd come apart easily ( mine has yet to fall ) , this is a nice idea of having a AC ( home ) and DC ( on the road ) charger for your Kindle or such.Keep in mind though you NEED a tip that 's appropriate for your device . Be it the A00 tip for your Kindle or whatever . Having this alone will not do anything for you.It comes with a nice black bag to keep both chargers and the wire spool inside of along with the tip .	1
Just as I imagined it . Fits well with the phone and it does not come out at all and sits well .	1
Nothing remarkable , but well made and has been holding up very well now for over 2 months.I like that i do n't have to unflap anything to quickly grab my phone when it rings .	1
The shipment was on time , and I am happy with the product . The product was Exactly what I ordered , I would recommend this item .	1
Thank you the item was received it was 100 % satisfied with the item the one that received it was very happy as well thanks	1
I bought the Treo 700p to help eliminate a few gadgets so now I have my palm , MP3 and telephone all in one unit which is handy for my morning runs too . The only thing I did n't like was having the wired headset even though the cord was long enough I kept jerking the cord during my runs pulling the ear buds out . I needed a different solution and figured bluetooth headsets were they way but I did not want to lose stereo capabilities . Enter the BT8010.First off , the BT8010 can be used as a one-ear mono headset like all the other BT headsets . This is great because I can still use the headset when driving . Unlike some of the other stereo headsets such as the Plantronics you ca n't wear them when driving.Then , when I need stereo for running , I just plug in the left ear unit into the mono headset . So there is a wire but it is only behind my head connecting the left & right parts of the headset.The headset grips the ear really well so even during a run the headset stays in place . This was what I was hoping would happen so I was very happy with the results . And the speaker that fits into the ear is comfortable ( for my ear at least ) .Pairing the headset to the 700p was not difficult . In order to get stereo out of the 700p one has to download the Softick Audio Gateway which supports A2DP streaming to BT headsets . That 's just because the Treo 700p does n't support A2DP over BT natively.Paring the headset to my Thinkpad running Windows XP Professional was painless and quick . Now when I 'm working I can stream music to my headset from the laptop and when a call comes in on the 700p it pauses the music and switches to the phone ! When I hang up on the call the headset returns to the laptop , un-pauses the music and I 'm back to listening to music . While I know most BT headsets can do this I was amazed the first time it happened.The battery life seems to be very good for my usage ( 40+ minute run listening to stereo plus about an hour of talk time a day ) . The mono headset charges via the USB port which I connect directly to my laptop . Jabra supply a power brick for charging from a wall outlet but I do n't see myself ever using it.The stereo left ear piece does n't need charging as it picks up electricity from the mono headset via the wire.The mono headset also has volume control on it ( the round silver thingy ) which is nice , again for running , not having to mess with the phone to adjust the volume.I have n't had any complaints about the sound of my voice when talking on the phone.I tried to see out how far I could go from the devices and it was different for each one . With the Treo 700p I could only go about 5-10 feet and I could hear crackling . I could go about 20 feet from the laptop . I was hoping to be able to go further but I guess that is just the characteristics of low powered BT.I 've also tried the mono headset out in the Toyota and could hear clearly even with the noise around me . Now I am truly wireless in all possible ways .	1
if you 're reading this , you 've obviously done your homewook ! You 've found the best bang for the buck , bar none ! ! This is by far the best bluetooth headset I 've ever owned ! A2DP is what drew me in ( the ability to stream music from phone ) , but other features blew me away . OLED Display with Battery life indicator , no more guessing how much longer you can go on a charge , not to mention telling you `` Charge Complete '' ! Display also gives the options for a Call List , PHONE BOOK , and Settings ... . in which are Vibrate Alert ( yes , this thing can vibrate on an incoming call ! ) , Display ( which encompases Caller ID , `` Quiet '' Mode , and Brightness Controll ) , `` Wearing '' ( which lets you chose which side the headset can be read from -right or left ear wearing ) , Language , Equalizer ( Neutral , Rock , Pop , Jazz , Classical ) , Paired Devices , Factory Reset , and About ( which lets you see the firmware you currently have ) . Yes , this thing is so detailed , you can upgrade firmware ! ! Download the `` BT8010 Controll Center '' to create and manage your phonebook , install a new language , and upgrade firmware . I 'm not sure how this gets any less than a 3 rating as it does FAR MORE than any other bluetooth headset I 've had , and only a fraction of the price ! If you can find it , there is also a stereo unit ( a mini of this one ) that can be hooked on via micro-usb connection in back to have stereo on music AND CALLS ! Three microphones insure great call quality . -I stood in a server room ( 10+ PC 's running , loud , and the other party could n't hear anything but me ! I have talked to Jabra Customer Support as they are upgrading their site and CS has been amazing to boot ! ! I bought one and loved it , so I recently bought 4 more ... one for brother , 3 for co-workers ! Even if you use this for strictly hands-free talking , the quality is amazing ! GET THIS ! ! ! OEM Package includes : BT8010 mono unit , AC Charger , USB Cable	1
I love this bluetooth system for three reasons.1 ) It can be easily switched to right or left ear , whereas I 've seen other ear pieces that only work on one ear , or are difficult to change ears . This switches ears with an extremely easy adjustment.2 ) I love that it 's the only headset that can mono or stereo depending on whether you attach the 2nd ear piece or not . ALl the other stereo headsets are always dual earpieces.3 ) I love that you can connect this to two devices . I have it connected to my iPod and my Motorola ZN5 and it works for the most part automatically depending on which device you 're using.The sound quality is good and people I 've spoken to say they can head me well with it too.Negatives:1 ) When connecting to my two devices , I very often had to reset the headset to get it to connect to my phone after I had used it on my iPod . Eventually I realized that it just works better when it 's connected to just one device.2 ) The plastic piece that wraps behind the ear falls out of it 's connecting hole very very easily . It 's not hard to put it back in , but I wish it was planted in there better.Overall I love this bluetooth . I 've bought 3 sets of them because they 're out of production and I wanted to have some spares . My brother saw me use it and bought one for his iPhone too , and he likes it as well .	1
I have this headset , and I feel like it 's a pretty good device . I 've had it for a while and still have n't used the stereo speaker setup . The headset connects well with my Lg Vx8700 and Blackberry 8830 . The earhooks can be adjusted to fit any ear and is required for use . They do n't last very long before breakage , so I would recommend ordering more from the Jabra website ( $ 7 for 5 ) . Overall , a good device .	1
First I 'll start with the list of other wireless headphones I started with.- Radio shack 2.4GHz Wireless Stereo Headphones ( Uncomfortable heavy kill your ears ) - Creative 's SE2300 Bluetooth Wireless Headphones ( oh my aching ears ... ouch ! ) - Logitech FreePulse Wireless Headphones with Bluetooth 2.0 EDR ( very nice ! 99.9 % there , but , they must be worn upside down and without the ear hug . Although very soft the position of the ear piece digs in your ear and need constant adjustment . ) ... and finally , - Motorola HT820 Bluetooth Stereo Headset ( another big ouchy , and bulky ) So after that exhaustive search and test in my private hell of R & D ; , I looked into this brand called `` Jabra '' . These people have it together with all the comfort and usability in mind . It 's possible that it 's just me . I 've read some of the other reviews and in reading them I heard things like ( uncomfortable , dual BT Devices working poorly , must have gaping hole in side of head to accommodate speakers ) . Let me just say that first of all out of the 4 I 've tested and tried to use , these where the most adjustable comfort accommodating feature rich ear pieces I 've ever used.Three cheers for Jabra !	1
I have had 3 pairs of this headset . I lost one , bought one for my wife , and bought myself a replacement . As a mono bluetooth it works great , although a bit on the heavy side . As a stereo bluetooth I love it . I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out . I do n't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something . This is just so much more convenient . Some complain that the sound it not as good , but I find it more than adequate for working out . When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears . My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design . I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece . It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge .	1
With the Iphone now able to use Stereo Bluetooth ( a2dp ) , I did my research and found this item which I had seen when it first came out . Of course now it has come down in price drastically and became too good of a purchase to pass on.The order arrived early and my only complaint with the seller is that they repackaged the headset.This device works great as a hands free driving device and if you want to listen to music you just attach the external ear speaker . Because it can be use both ways is one of the reasons why I bought it.The fit can be a problem if you do not like the hook over your ears and you may have to spend some time adjusting the device each time you put it on so that it is at least tolerable if not comfortable . This goes for the main unit and the external ear speaker . Do not be afraid to try each unit on your other ear as it may give a more comfortable fit.The sound is good and will keep you entertained but if you are a an audiophile use a good wired headset . While the sound is good it is at times tinny and missing the base . Considering though this is a device you wear out on the street , the background noise is probably ruining your perception of the sound anyway.This is a great device and considering how much it costs is a great value . If you do not mind a loop over the ear then this is the device for you .	1
I love this little gadget that enables me to charge my phone AND bluetooth headset at the same time . I leave all other travel chargers at home , relying on my iGo with these sorts of attachments .	1
I bought a few iGo tips to charge my Kindle eBook reader , myNintendo DS , and my Samsung Blackjack smartphone.The splitter fits two tips and two devices perfectly . I 'm very happy with the fact that I 'm cutting down on e-waste by eliminating so many of the proprietary chargers for my devices.It 's a great concept , and quality product , and the perfect accessory .	1
The iGo chargers and tips are really great . I use this to charge two devices at once using my iGo chargers . They are just great products . I only need one charger to charge all of my electronic devices . Extremely handy & nice . Works with all iGo chargers .	1
This is a very useful item and essential to complete the IGo charging system , you can charge your laptop , cell phone , mp3 player.I recommend this item to all IGo users .	1
IGO products will save you money by only replacing the tips and not the whole power source . Saves space when traveling . Very convenient - these work perfectly . I have the power source for the home and the car & many tips . I love it & think it is a brilliant idea .	1
Iam very happy with this product , working excellent , I can charging two cell phone at the same time while driving	1
I have a portable charger and the cord extends the flexibility . It 's too rigid from the charger , device tip to device.Nice ... . : )	1
This works great charging both my Blackberry and my Bluetooth headset at the same time . I also have tips for iPod and Motorola . Anyone that regularly uses an iGo for more than one device would benefit from this being able to charge 2 at once . I did not notice a shorter or longer charging time when charging one device versus two .	1
I switched from a BT250V and am very happy with the BT5020 . It is very light weight and stays on my ear . Sound quality is better than the 250v.My only complaint is the eargels do not stay on the earphone securly .	1
I really like the `` behind the ear '' headsets , they seem more comfortable to me so I decided to upgrade to the Jabra BT5020 . I moved from the Jabra BT500 to the BT5020 and really like the BT5020 . I like the size and solid black color , it 's very unassuming , never cared for the startrek look of the other headsets . The volume is loud and clear . The headset is very easy to wear for long periods of time because of it 's light weight . It has GREAT talk and standby time and comes with a AC Adapter and a USB cable for charging , so you can have the AC Adapter at home and the USB cable at work or with your laptop for charging.I had a bit of trouble pairing it to my Treo 700Wx but got it working , it also paired fine with my wifes Motorola Razor and my kids Samsung U740.Great unit , good features and a good price !	1
do n't change this product need extra just in case kinda hard on blue tooths jabra will not do you will not do you wrong	1
I start with jabra 250 , bt500 and now the jabra bt5020 . This is an excellent bluetooth and very light.I use to connect a plastic to it but now I am using this without it.I was thinking of getting a jabra bt2020 but I am so happy wearing this bt5020.Jabra customer service are very helpful if you have questions about it.I recommend this executive bluetooth headset .	1
I was n't getting very good audio quality , and could not manage to perform the long duration hold of the answer button to get my Samsung SCH-A870 to enter speech recognition mode.Another web-site I found explained how to enable/disable the vibrate feature of the headset , and also perform a reset.Try the search string : Jabra BT5020 Vibrate Enable/Disable Reset the DeviceNote : neither procedure is explained in the manual for the headset which came with the unit ( or the downloadable manual from the Jabra website for that matter . That is inexcusable in my opinion . The manual on the web should be made up to date by a manufacturer at the very least ) .Once the headset was reset , not only was the sound quality better , I could finally use the long duration tap of the answer button feature to initiate voice calling on the cell phone through the headset.I actually like the headset now . No issues with voice or digit dialing.The only drawback I find is the earbud does n't stay on the earpiece .	1
Exactly what I expected , works and does it 's job made by Sony and reasonably priced .	1
Ha , this was for a phone I had 3 years ago , but it was a good charger . Did its job and for a good price . Will reccommend .	1
As stated this is a Sony product in the original package . It appears well made and charges my Sony P1i phone . It actually has 2 lights . The first is a ready light on the 12 V plug end that indicates the charger is plugged into the adapter in your auto ( it does not hurt the battery of my vehicle to keep this plugged in all the time ) . The second light is on the other end ( that attaches to your Sony phone ) and can be turned on or off . It is fairly bright and can be used as a flashlight .	1
it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20 % . it is a waste of money .	-1
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money .	-1
I am disappointed that the 1A did n't work with my iPad . That 's what I get for buying a cheap adapter .	-1
After a week only one side works	-1
Only works one side at a time . When you connect two cables , one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses . I purchased two of them and it 's the same problem . Cheap and bad quality .	-1
Did n't last very long . Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I should n't have expected it to last .	-1
I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time . My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on , it will not charge while powered on .	-1
I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months , it subsequently died on me.Pros : -Has 2 USB ports for charging , one ( the top ) is 2.1 amps . The bottom slot is lower , presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight . I 've had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones , except the very high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $ 2.Cons : -It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger . It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends . The two slot design makes this design very handy ; with a 1 slot design , no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord . Of course , after this charger died , I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months , I began to notice the LED light flickering . It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently . I 'm not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring , bad design , I guess I 'll never know . I thought about getting another since they are so cheap , but then I thought better of it . Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason , it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I have n't found one in my price range yet .	-1
I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging , it felt hot . Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt . Tried the other one too and same thing . Be careful ... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system	-1
I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after , the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots . Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase .	-1
It looked like it was used ! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again	-1
This case for some reason is peeling , there is n't much left of the orginal skin , i loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i would n't recommend this specific one for anyone .	-1
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3 . They really need to start making these chargers better ... .I 've been thru several ! ! ! !	-1
JUNK ! ! ! ... ... This product must be miss labeled . I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger . The lights are on , the phone says its charging but nothing happens . I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is very upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge . If you need a reliable charger , DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2 , I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter . It charges fast and is dependable .	-1
The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period . I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it , I 've noticed that it does n't come apart like most vehicle chargers .	-1
WHAT A GREAT PRICE ! RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX , PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ... DO N'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD , OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ... BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT , AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WAS N'T CHARGING . SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER .	-1
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days . Has n't worked since . My phone does not even recognize it 's plugged in .	-1
This thing worked well when it actually functioned , but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I 'm guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working , who knows.. What a waste of money .	-1
First , this is kind of cheap-looking , but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone , so that 's forgiveable . The springs on the side do n't have much force , though , so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port . The cable is sturdy , but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff , which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle . It 's held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE : Stopped charging after a month .	-1
I received this product in a very timely manner which was delightful , however , I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item . I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time .	-1
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord ... ... ..The charger itself working fine up to this point ... ... ... .Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $ 19.00	-1
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet . It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone .	-1
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days . I 'm not upset because it was very inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon . When it did work it worked very well .	-1
This charger does n't charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 ( i9100 ) properly.When I connect it to my S2 , the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual ( abnormal ) way .	-1
Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the , Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ... .. The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made , and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well ... .I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems ... .I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct ! Ugh !	-1
In a nutshell , this is NOT an OEM charger . Although it has the Samsung markings , it does n't seat well with a Samsung phone . This means that it 's either meant for another market or it 's counterfeit . With that said , I would n't buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17 , 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers . After using this for a while , it is still garbage . It does not charge my phone and in fact , it drains the phone . This must be a counterfeit product . It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone . DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! ! ! !	-1
After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it was n't even worth it .	-1
This one came in broken The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece . Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together . If it was not broken I would like it . Also if it was n't in three click in pieces	-1
I never do this , but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear . If you look at all the positive reviews for this case , you will see that none of them are verified purchases and yet every negative review , other than this one of course , is a verified purchase . What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap . Furthermore , many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product , once per color . Why Amazon allows this is beyond me , but that is not the point . Also , if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers , you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other . Beware the paid shills !	-1
Watch-out , all these positive reviews are fake . Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name . What a sleazy way to sell an item .	-1
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this . it did n't even fit his phone right . poorly made .	-1
I bought this for the at & t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was very slow in getting this item to me . I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2 , but the cut outs was NOT good . The cut out opening was too small for the power button , there was also an extra cut out for no reason . It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars , but bad opening for my phone will be costly .	-1
the case did not fit my phone ; was a tad too small . i could only get 3 corners into the case . i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $ 20 from a local store . have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s*** , and no damage to the phone . good reason to buy a case , just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked , and broke the display screen , making his phone unusable . buy a case , not this rubber thing . i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it 's arrival	-1
I read the first few reviews and did n't read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2 . Wish I had known that .	-1
there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what 's carried by Asia . I 'm in USA , I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA , the cover did n't fit , and the speaker location is different from the phone . I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA , do n't buy cover from outside USA	-1
I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews . I do n't know how people are getting these cables to work ... but out of the 3 I bought , 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre ! The best I can do is get it to charge , though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about `` Unknown Device '' and `` Could not install drivers '' even though it works beautifully with the original cable . The only setting that works is `` Just Charge '' ! Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw ! I 've tried this with my Wife 's Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well . Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device !	-1
`` This cable not recommended for this device . '' That is what I get for an error message . Plus it is really short .	-1
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last . so this cord works on when plugged into the wall . when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything . so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but do n't even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc .	-1
poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone . I would not buy this .	-1
The cable is good , but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4 . It does plug in , but not far enough in to hold securely .	-1
I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone , whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone . I had to buy another USB cord because I became very frustrated with this	-1
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices . They are also very short . Took a long time to ship . Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices . It did not work in my S4 . They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better .	-1
damaged charger . when i recieved it the charger had a short in it . i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge .	-1
This charger does n't work very well . When plugged in , it shows that it is charging , but after ten minutes I 'm lucky to get 1 % more on my battery . I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower ... that 's really all it 's good for .	-1
I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone , right in the middle of a long trip . FFFFFFUUUUUUU ...	-1
The plug fits and it charges my Captivate , it felt rather snug . The `` retractable '' -ness of this charger is anything but . Plain ol ' does n't work . I literally took it out of the package , and the first time I pulled the cord out - did n't yank , tug , or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it . I pulled it out further , retracted about 4 or so inches of it . Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger versus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button , it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get . The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length . The main reason I wanted this was for the `` retractability '' since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now .	-1
I was very pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift . However , I can not give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked .	-1
The Phone charger works , it charges the phone . However , while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I 'll have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better .	-1
When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half . Lesson learned , cheap things break too quickly .	-1
it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s . Once it was pulled out it would not retract	-1
THIS IS A BAD CHARGER IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND IT HAS A REALLY BAD SHORTAGE . I HATE IT !	-1
Excited about this based on good reviews , but did not have the same experience.Tested on my Nexus S cell phone , person on the other end complained about static and poor quality sound . I unplugged headset and switched to using my cell , and they said the problem went away , so unfortunately problem seems to be with this headset.Also , just FYI , this does not come retail packaged , but shows up in a plastic bag with no instructions . Not a problem for me , but makes me wonder where these are from and the quality .	-1
I 've tried and returned at least 5 headsets ranging from $ 15 to $ 150 . This one was typical of the others that I returned , low volume on the earpiece and low quality microphone . I finally ended up with a Panasonic TCA60 for about $ 19 which is very loud and sounds great on both ends . It 's nothing fancy , no volume control and no mute , but who needs that when you can accomplish the same thing with your phone . Price does not determine sound quality . I recommend this product .	-1
The only problem with this headset is that people you are talking to will have trouble hearing you . This is pretty important to me , so I only give it 2 stars . I have used it extensively with both my cell phone and my cordless phones at home with the same problem .	-1
I do n't think this will last very long . I was thinking of deploying this in a call center environment , but I do n't think it would last very long . Plus , the cord is too short for desktop use .	-1
Installation was easy and the tool kit worked though the plastic tools are no the robust and will break if you tweak on them too much . The paper foil was coming off the battery when I open the package but folding back in place worked , once it 's in the phone it is not an issue . So far the phone charges fast and the life is much better than the 2 year old battery it replaced . So far I would recommend this battery.Update : 4 weeks after installing this battery is would only last 5 hours and that was barely using the iPhone with NO voice calls at all during that time and no extra heavy use of the internet or anything . Drained it and charged from dead several times , made sure that location services , blue tooth , apps closed ... all OFF and still drained . Got my money back and bought one for 1/2 the price and that one works great ! Maybe I just got a defective battery ... . A risk we all take when buying these 3rd party batteries .	-1
the torx is the only real useful tool in here for the evo4g . not a big fan , just use a credit card instead	-1
Seeing is how the 2 , 5 star reviews on this item are from fake users who seem to be trash talking other iphone battery sellers and 5 staring there own is pretty messed up so therefore it appears this seller is some type of scammer .	-1
Pros- Good tool set if you need to take things apart.Cons- They came in a plastic bag ( no case ) - They 're extremely flimsy plastic that makes me feel like if I use them over 10 times , they 're going to break.I do n't recommend this at all and would recommend you buy something other than this .	-1
Battery would not charge in iPhone . iPhone shut down after 2 minutes of being powered up . Had to throw it away .	-1
These are all torx drivers , there is no flathead or phillips in this set , which is going back to Amazon today .	-1
Really poor quality tweezer bent like nothing screw drivers made of cheap plastic adhesive removing tool again cheap plastic you get what you pay for would not recommend to anyone who is trying to perform phone surgery	-1
I received it today and it does n't charge . I 'm sure it is used - I found a piece of broken iPhone glass on the contact side .	-1
The eargels fit to the earpiece is fine , nice and tight , but as far as actually getting ANY of the sizes to comfortably fit , FORGET IT	-1
I got these for my jawbone headset . Many had said they work great . but for the life of me i cant figure out how you get them to work short of superglue and even then they are too quiet to hear so i guess they work on the jabra they are designed for but not the jawbone .	-1
When I first installed one of these on my new Jawbone II , they were fantastic . They fit my ear canal perfectly , negating the need for the ear loop that came with it . Unfotunately after a few days they started rejecting my headset . The ear pieces would not stay on the Jawbone , and they would no longer stay firmly in my ear . I tried washing and drying them thoroughly , but that only helped for an hour or so . I am not sure what the fit problem is , but they turned out to not work for my Jawbone II and me at all .	-1
these were advertised to fit the habra stone . they did not . i do n't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it . not even one piece fit . threw them away	-1
I bought these so my headset would be more comfortable ... These hurt your ears just like the one that comes with it no matter what size you use . I would n't recommend this to anyone ... Do n't waste your money .	-1
The gel inserts on the Jabra is quite uncomfortable , at least for me . It 's a bit hard to make the earbud stay in my ear , and forget about jogging wearing this . Also the insert comes off very easily , and if a friend wants to borrow it and has different size of ears , you need to find the other sizes of the insert . Sound quality is mediocre , as callees often complain about wind noise from my end . I 'm not happy with these .	-1
These things were terrible . The & # 34 ; Boom & # 34 ; would keep pulling the ear but out of my ear and I could n't keep anything in place . The cord was very flimsy ... It was just an all around bad buy . Would n't do it again .	-1
I tried using it with my Sansa Clip MP3 player in my Toyota MR2 . The car makes a lot of noise in any case , so I 'm not holding out for audio lab quality . However , the product made a quite audible ( at low automobile speeds ) click-click-click . I might have been able to tolerate that . However , there was also an electronic whistle increasing in frequency with the RPM of the engine . The whistle interfered excessively with the intended sound from the player . The volume of the Coby CA-747 was ok . I had n't thought that would be an issue until I bought a comparable Maxell cassette adapter at Long 's to replace the Coby CA-747 . The volume with the Maxell product was very weak , and I had to turn it way up . The Maxell did n't go click-click-click , but it whistled , too . So both the Maxell and the Coby get 1 star from me . I 'm trying out the offering from Philips next ...	-1
This item doestn work on 2001 Chevy suburban.I tried too many things to get it work but no chances anyways dual position thing is good for using with different players .	-1
very disspointed not getting a coby cassette tape because it did not work in my car : / i need my music	-1
Seems great at first . But sound is kind of shaky , almost like the magnetic head is not making good contact . Also it has a bad habit of locking up the wheels and it makes the radio think it 's hit the end of the tape and will auto reverse only to find it locked again and then reverse again . It 'll get stuck in this infinite loop . You have to take it out , smack it a few times to free up the wheels and then put it back in . Oh and that plug for the cable on the tape is loose as hell . pull on your device too quickly and it 'll put the plug right out of the tape while its still in the deck .	-1
But will keep this short and sweet -Cord contains lead and must be handled regularly in a car where there is nowhere to clean your hands after touching the thing.Sound quality quickly goes downhill with crackling evident after only 5 uses.Now stuck in my dashboard player because the modular adapter broke off and the cassette will not fully eject . I am sure the husband will be griping the entire time he tries to get it unstuck.Avoid at all costs ! I scanned past the negative reviews since this product had a few really positive reviews with a lot of helpful votes . Big mistake as now I have to unstick the adapter from my cassette player and try to get Amazon to take it back . ( I bought 2 on clearance )	-1
These things are just a confidence trick . They do n't do a thing . They ca n't do a thing . If you believe these make your phone work better then you probably find the stripes down the side of cars make them go faster too .	-1
Come on Amazon , I ca n't really believe you are selling this under your own name !	-1
This thing is a waste of paper , it does n't give u any better reception . This is a total rip off in my book : - (	-1
I would like to say that this is not cheap junk , but it did nothing at all for my cell reception.On the other hand I have an iPhone with AT & T ; , so it could be that combination does n't work with it.It appears it worked for a few people with a different phone , so I am going to be generous and give it 2 stars , taking into account it could have been my unit . ; - )	-1
Want to try one ? They sell these at the dollar stores . It does nothing to improve your signal .	-1
Did n't work , It did not work at all . I have a dead spot when I drive to work , where I totally lose the Signal . This device did not help at all . DO NOT WASTE your money on it . even for less than $ 2.00 , its not worth anything .	-1
i cant say it works because i tryit for a long time on my iphone and it didnt made a difference at all ...	-1
I purchased this for my sisters phone . She continually has calls dropped , so I got her this signal booster , and it has n't made a bit of difference . I bought these before for my previous cell phones , and they really seemed to help . But apparently not so much anymore .	-1
Contrary to what this site and T-Mobile lead me to believe , T-Mobile could not provide coverage at my home address . This did not stop Amazon.com from selling me the phone , nor T-Mobile from transferring my existing ( working ) AT & amp ; T number to their service ( of course , this took two weeks and & gt ; 10 phone calls ) .After receiving no reception , I called T-Mobile and was informed that they do not actually cover my area.I called AT & amp ; T back , and they happily attempted to restore my account , only to find that T-Mobile refused to release the numbers.After a month of essentially no coverage from anyone , my phones are happily back on AT & amp ; T where they belong.The bad news is that T-Mobile has sent me a bill for more than double the quoted monthly rate and Amazon.com has not refunded my purchase price.Even in areas where I could get coverage , the phone itself did not work well . After pressing more than a few keys , the screen would lock up and I needed to remove the battery to reset it.Last warning : Watch out for the charges for inbound messages -- if you really dislike a T-Mobile subscriber , send them lots of text messages ( free from their site ) -- the subscriber has to pay $ 0.05/message .	-1
the freaking power cable quit working w/in a few weeks and neither t-mobile nor sony will fix it for less than $ 20 . Sony took my address and said they would , but it never showed up.Well the phone is rugged ! It 's been 3-4 years and it still works . It went through the washing machine and half the dryer . It was submerged in a puddle for 30 minutes- it keeeps working.The blue tooth syncs w/ my pc and tells me where to go etc . I buy a $ 25 access card every couple of months and avoid the taxes . It 's been a great little phone .	-1
Great features - except for the phone one . Seriously - Bluetooth , IR , good phone book features , nice color display ( though it washes out if you are using polarized glasses ) . However , I get much weaker signals ( and call quality ) on this phone vs. my previous one . If everywhere you would use the phone has strong signals , you may be just fine - but if you are on the edge , this is not the phone for you , unless you value the non-phone features more than it working as a phone . : )	-1
I just called T-Mobile with complaints about my weak battery and told them talk time on the cell phone is 840min according to Amazon 's specs for the T610 phone . T-mobile told me the talk time is 5 hours ( 300min ) . Who do you believe ? I am tired of liars and money-gobbling b*st*rds !	-1
Considering how old the phones that use this type of battery are , I am not surprised that I received a used battery . I am a little mad at the fact that the product listing said these batteries would be new though . The battery I received holds the charge for about a day , which is the same as my old one.Disappointing indeed .	-1
It does n't fit my phone and now I must return it . What a hassle ! That 's all I have to say !	-1
I ordered this based on the rave reviews I saw for it . I am using it with a Treo 600 and I can barely hear anything out of the ear piece , even with the spongy covering removed .	-1
As with so many Plantronics headsets that I have owned , the problem is with the connector jack , the movement of the wire causes the headset to loose contact with the plug-in jack , which at that point they are ready for the garbage bin . When they are new they work very , very good , excellent sound quality .	-1
This did n't work in my phone . It was rather cheap , I ended up giving it away because it was cheaply made !	-1
This item is useless . The plug is far too small to fit my phone , despite the description that this will fit `` LG phones '' . I own the DARE and this does n't fit . The DARE uses the standard jack while this thing is the 2.5 mm whatever . Who uses such a tiny plug ? I 've NEVER seen that size on any cell phone ! You get what you pay for . This item is a joke .	-1
This headset would not stay in my ear no matter how hard I tried . I like the fact that it is small , that it sounds OK , and that the person on the line could hear me OK ( not great ) But I could not figure out how to keep it in my ear without holding it , which defeats the purpose of having a headset ! ! I ordered 4 of them , they were about $ 3 apiece with shipping , and the first two are buzzy and could not be used . I would not recommend this product . I went to an over the head headset by Jensen , and am VERY pleased !	-1
More importantly , the point is that the thing that goes in your ear is a cheap , thin little foam pad that will wear out very quickly . When mine arrived , it was in little pieces all over the inside if the plastic bag they shipped it in . No box , no packing - not even some cheap bubble wrap and a rubber band , just chucked it into a bag . I realize it 's super cheap but it should last a month . Is there we are at now ? I wish Amazon would be ... at all selective on what they offer for sale .	-1
Sound was fine through the headset , however the Mic did not work at all.Waste of money and not worth returning .	-1
The earpiece is stamped `` Verizon '' and is of different finish than pictured . There was no packing slip enclosed but the USPS envelope in came in showed , `` ACCSTOP '' in Oxnard , CA . For $ 2.47 , I guess it does n't matter but still , not the item pictured . It also came in a little plastic baggie - it was represented as new. Can not try it as the 3.5mm adapter has n't arrived from the other item in the earpiece set purchase .	-1
I have purchased 4 different Jabra headsets , because they are the most comfortable and easy to hear with , but they have poor microphone quality . I thought I would try this model , the MX150 Flexible Boom . Again , sound quality was crap . I make a living on the phone , so others being able to hear me is very important.I have ended up getting a Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco which has worked the best so far .	-1
I purchased FIVE wireless headsets around the same time for my office workers . One tried to get it to work , and finally gave up . She kept getting a feedback sound in the headset even when not on a call . I dont know if it was something in the walls making it have feedback , but we couldnt get the problem to stop so she went back to a wired headset.I have been using the headset she had problems with , and i constantly have that annoying pulsing feedback.One of the five just quit working this week.Problems with 2 out of 5 headsets seems like pretty poor odds to me.I will try a different kind next time ... if there is a next time .	-1
This phone is ugly and heavy and has a terrible user interface even for techies like myself . It also drops calls like crazy here in Manhattan . The Moto V600 is a much better phone , takes better pictures , gives you better clarity and reception , is smaller , and is much , much cheaper . Get the Moto V600 if you want T-Mobile . Stay away from this ugly monster .	-1
I recently moved to Phoenix , Arizona , and thought it a good time to get a new mobile phone . A friend recommended Nextel , saying we 'd use the direct connect function . Cool . So I ordered an i730 from Amazon . After charging and activating and waiting the required day , I called to get my phone number . It was a Palo Alto , CA , number ! ? That 's over 700 miles away ! An 11 hour drive to the next state . No way close to a local number . Nextel did not seem to understand or care . & quot ; It 's the closest we have. & quot ; & quot ; There are no 602 area code phone numbers left. & quot ; I begged for maybe a 480 number or anything that is a local call from here in Phoenix . Nothing doing . After a few more days and a few more calls to Nextel that went nowhere , I called Sprint ( who have not been customer service stars to me in the past ) and within four minutes had a local 602 Phoenix number working on my current Sprint phone . I canceled the Nextel service . They are charging me $ 35 ( expected ) plus $ 11.53 in taxes , fees and assessments & quot ; we ca n't change & quot ; for a couple of days when all I called was customer service.If you buy the phone , I hope Nextel has a local area code for you , because if they do n't you are stuck for $ 46.53 and an Amazon return . It was a pretty color screen though . . .	-1
It 's a nice-looking product . It seems like I would have liked it . But ... My unit had an electrical problem . I connected two portable external hard drives , one powered external hard drive , a printer , an external DVD+-RW drive , a mouse and a keyboard . Then I plugged it in.First I noticed my mouse did n't work . So I unplugged it and plugged in another one . `` That 's strange , that one does n't work either , '' I thought . `` Hmmm , and what 's that smell ? '' Turns out , that smell was a hard drive frying . Once I figured that out I unplugged everything and waited.After a few hours , when I figured everything would have cooled down , I started testing my devices . One portable external drive still `` sort of '' works . I can see most of the file structure but copying attempts fail . The powered external hard drive mostly worked for a couple days and then quit . One portable hard drive never worked again . The optical drive still works , occasionally , but typically wo n't boot . Occasionally the printer works . The mice never worked again . And the keyboard was fine . Everything 's been tested on 3 different PC systems and 1 Linux system.The worst part ? Those were my redundant data storage . I lost everything .	-1
For one , this product is built very cheap . This means that overtime some ports will simply stop working ... why ? I 'm not really sure ... perhaps cheap components , and slight bending ? Secondly , it does not support charging , and yet it does at the same time . If you plug in say an apple device you 'll get an error , but it will charge which again does not make sense.This is not a 3.0 USB hub , it 's a 2.0 . Many new devices will require you to have 3.0 now or in the near future . For instance , my new webcam hates being plugged into this hub as the performance greatly drops.Lastly : Mine is just about destroyed , because of a slight drink mishap . Nothing seems to be wrong with device other than ... it stops working from time to time , and I sometimes have to clean the ports with a small amount of water to get it to work again..just very annoying.- Additional Notes : The Stand is horrible . It wo n't stay on , especially if you have multiple cords attached that pull in various directions like the power cable . ( It falls out easily , it does not snap on , it 's basically just a slightly heavy stand that it `` rests '' on top of . ( Useless ) - It glows neon Blue . Why ? I 'm not sure . I like it because it matches my setup , but it 's very bright , and I 'd rather the `` power '' be used towards the other devices.Finally : This device will likely not support 7 devices being plugged in at the same time ... .I would get 3-4 to work ... maybe ... . at any given point . Eventually the two bottom ports simply decided to `` not work '' entirely which is completely stupid because I rarely ever used those ports to begin with . This also made me think there was something wrong with my device , and wasted my time trouble shooting . ( just had to switch ports ) In other words ... do n't buy this device ... get a cheaper hub with more slots , or a 3.0 hub with more features.This is cheap ...	-1
Positives : Bluetooth , IR port , VGA Camera , multiple e-mail accounts , speaker phone , more programs becoming available for Symbian O/S . I use Bluetooth for wireless headset and to make the phone serve as my wireless modem.Negatives : phone too big ; voice recognition worthless , low volume from ear piece , IR port weak so TV remote control programs do n't work well , slow menu 's and response . Get Opera browser if your phone does not come with it since the WAP browser will only frustrate you ( Opera has problems on this phone , but works most of the time ) . T-Mobile programmed the backlight in the display to turn off after a few seconds , although Nokia made it adjustable , and T-Mobile wo n't fix it .	-1
This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand , but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices ( headset , handheld , or desktop computer ) . My old Siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above.If you hunt around the web , you will find many websites with people complaining about the lack of drivers for this phone and the cavelike silence from Nokia when asked for help.If your needs are limited to making phonecalls and taking snapshots , this phone will probably satisfy you . If you need Bluetooth , stay away .	-1
i had heard so many good things about this headset and even tried on my co-workers before i bought it , but what i did n't test out was the reception/range . i have been using a logitech mobile freedom headset for almost a year now and love it , EXCEPT for the fit . it fits horribly.this is where the BT205 shines . it fits great . it does n't hurt . i can wear it for hours . it seems to have a ton of talk time ( at least 6 hours , i would say ) ... but the reception just plain sucks . i do n't know if it 's all the electrical devices running in my apartment , but damn , i ca n't get more than about 5 feet away from my phone before this unit starts to get all crackly on me . you almost have to have the phone 1 ) within about 6 feet of you and 2 ) have it on the same side of your body as the jabra . basically , count on walking around with your phone in your pocket.do heed jabra 's warnings about the wireless home network interfering with this device ! and your microwave . and your electric fans ... and running water ... they all make reception horrible . i think my problem might have been the wireless home network . but c'mon people , us geeks who use bluetooth headsets are the same geeks who have wireless home networks . duh.summary : pros : *lightweight*comfortable*got a good price on ebay ( $ 42 shipped for new ) *easy to usecons : *range , range , range ! this is a huge one for me . if i have to keep my phone within 6 feet of me all the time , what 's the point ? *too costly at $ 80 for what you get*everything interferes with this unit . you might as well go sit in a room with nothing in it for good reception.needless to say , it 's for sale on ebay !	-1
I tried this out because my old Bluetrek that I loved died . Actually , I killed it when I forgot where it was and sat on it . I was impressed with the advertised battery life , and took the plunge . Should n't have . While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet , I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body , the connection gets fickle . You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight . Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology , does n't it ? And the static is NOT just in your end ; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it . So if yo get this , be prepared to anger your party on the other line . On the plus side , the sound is nice and loud in th speaker . That 's about it . Try something else , like a bluetrek or motorola or something . I am trying the Motorola next . This thing is trash .	-1
Magnetic mounting is a joke . It is guaranteed to fall over , scratch your roof and generally be a pain in the buttocks.I wish this antenna were offered with a NMO mount . It would be very nice to mount this securely , and well worth the trouble and effort to achieve a good mechanical and electrical connection to an auto roof .	-1
Amazon continues to ship this antenna with the Wilson Electronics Sleek Booster , and it is not the right antenna . Wilson has told them many times they are shipping the wrong antenna but they continue to do it . This was very frustrating and caused me a lot of grief as I was not able to get on the Internet for a week due to Amazon 's problem . I am returning the whole package to Amazon even though Wilson Electronics was able to send me an adapter in the next week or so , but the primary reason I purchased this product was to use over the Holidays where the place we were staying had little reception . Not being able to use my smartphone hot spot really made me angry . There is not excuse for this as Amazon has been told many times by Wilson Electronics that they are sending customers the wrong product .	-1
They claim this works for Sprint PCS but I got one for my Virgin Mobile MC760 and it wo n't pick up any signal ! In fact it actually makes the signal weaker ! I have to put the MC760 in a window to get a decent signal so I thought putting an antenna on the roof would be better but when I plug it into the MC760 the signal strength goes down ! I tried connecting it to a spectrum analyzer to check but it does n't get any signals compared to another cellphone antenna that does receive . I tried emailing Wilson but they were n't any help . Another problem was the cheaply made adapter that connects the proprietary FME connector on the antenna cable and plugs into the MC760 . I had to try 3 of them before I got one that would work . The first one had bad threads and would n't go on all the way , the second one had a loose center pin that pushed back in when I tried to connect it . The third one finally did fit correctly but there was still no signal . I do n't see how Wilson can get away with selling worthless junk antennas like this , they must get a lot of consumer fraud complaints . I 'm sending this useless antenna back for a refund.I purchased a Wilson 301101 trucker antenna , mounted it on a magnetic base for a CB antenna and stuck it on the roof and it works great . This one must have been defective .	-1
This did n't do much for me . Unfortunately , it may not be the blame . Ironically , I have a home repeater system after trying a couple of quick fixes ( I thought ) . This was an upgrade to a combination home and mobile solution I tried first before realizing the specific product to get the results I needed for my whole house solution . So in the mobile world , I 'm sure this would be helpful . It is the system as a whole that needs to be configured to a need which includes area of coverage , location , type of usage , cell frequency and more . So in putting a system together , for a whole home solution , you 'd be wise to call on the manufacturer rather than putting pieces together which may not 'fit ' the performance or compatibility of the other components in the system .	-1
This headset was a piece of junk right out of the box . I had nothing but problems with it and threw it away after the first day .	-1
I have been using the HS810 for 9 months now . I was initially very impressed because of the small size and its being relatively stable with a number of different phones . ( The early blue tooth standard is n't really as `` standard '' as one might hope ! ) However , it has proven rather fragile . Within 2 months the plastic case began breaking next to and inside the hinge for the on/off switch . Did not impact usability so I did n't care . For the last several months it has been hard to get a good connection witht he charger ( several of my colleagues are having similar problems ) . The headset has recently become useless because the main body of the case has cracked . I keep the unit in my briefcase , so I do n't know why it is proving as fragile as it has . If you can use it ( or the similar HS850 ) with some assurance that it will not be crushed , it is a good choice . Otherwise , I suggest looking at other designs .	-1
This might be the most comfortable BlueTooth headset out thereHowever , I 've been very upset with connection speeds and call volumeMost people say that they can hear me very well -- -- - however , the connection speeds take forever to establish -- -- in addition , the call volume is simply too low to even use it regularlyI use a Treo 650 -- - I 've heard that this headset works excellently with Moto products - your mileage may vary ... ..UPDATE : I have also tried the Moto 850 -- -- sadly , it is really no better than the 810 -- - there are some volume improvements , but the volume is simply too low on my Treo 650 -- -- I recommend the Scala 500	-1
I have had this headset for several months now , and not liking much about this headset other than its long battery life . This headset works OK , but the sound quality is poor and it does not function well in conditions other than perfect , ie . no background or wind noise , and very close to handset . I do like the feature of the headset turning off , when boom mike closed because thats where the battery savings comes from . Other than that I find nothing redeeming about this headset , I believe Motorola will discontinue this model because of its severe flaws .	-1
This pad is extremely unreliable in that it does not stick to my dash and is very poorly made . One thing I will say is my wallet and phone have not fallen from the pad . Unfortunately , the pad moves all around .	-1
Even though the package and description stated there was no adhesive , there certainly was a white backing too remove and place on dash . I felt the item was very thin , and to the touch not sticky at all . There were no groves as competing products and the part that faced up that was supposed to attract and `` stick '' was smooth . Overall , I was not impressed .	-1
I bought 10 of these . They are the worst product I have ever used . They DO NOT work as advertised . Nothing sticks to them	-1
The keyboard will connect to an iphone 3GS with iOS 4 but will not reconnect automatically.I did the CTRL + LFT FN + RT FN keys and the light on the keyboard starts flashing . Then check the bluetooth on the iphone and it discovers the keyboard . Then when you pair it the iphone will ask you to enter a 4 digit code and press enter on the keyboard . That part works perfectly.Then you can use the keyboard on the iPhone 3GS . But when you close the keyboard and the bluetooth connection is broken , it will not reconnect when you open the keyboard back up . I tried pressing keys and waiting . I checked the bluetooth status on the iphone and it shows not connected . No matter what I do it will not reconnect . I have to manually re-pair the keyboard and phone to get it to work . That makes the keyboard completely useless on the iPhone 3GS with iOS4 . There is a video posted on youtube where another person had the same problem.If anyone was able to get it to work properly with an iPhone 3GS with iOS4 , please let me know how you were able to do it .	-1
The driver for this device completely broke my Treo 650 , fortunately I have Sprint 's insurance plan so I was able to get a replacement Treo . I used the latest driver from the Thinkoutside website . If you have a Treo do not get this device .	-1
I purchased this product to send over to my wife who is on a trip , and complained about typing on a Blackberry . I thought I better install it before sending it after her , so I could guide her along . No PC where she is , so I tried to download as advertised . Result : Page Not Found.Company advised that since this is a discontinued item ( ? ) they took down the support pages.This would not be an issue normally - you can install the driver from a PC.It is the principle that a company can maintain a manufacturer 's description while not the web page to support the claim ... You know a manufacturer is a scumbag when their feedback/survey link gives you an error message back ... If any doubts read the blackberry link from the bottom of the review page , or click on the one star reviews . A shame	-1
It seems that this keyboard acts a little like those gold fish you bring home in a plastic bag from the pet shop . You have to put the whole bag in the tank until it acclimates to it 's new surroundings . I went from wanting to love the thing for the sheer coolness factor ... .to boxing it up to send back when it would n't sync to my Axim x50v ... .to giving it another chance and after it was good and ready to work flawlessly , I now love it again . The keyboard is smaller than standard but very useable . It 's great for writing a longer e-mail , inputting contacts , or writing a letter in word , when you do n't want to peck at the screen with your stylus endlessly . The construction feels solid and opening and closing is a snap . Pun intended . The only major flaw is with the cradle that holds your PDA . It is removable which is the desired use to space the PDA a little further away from you . But the feet that clip it to the keyboard just do n't want to let go . The plastic it 's made out of does n't seem especially robust and I feel certain it will snap off eventually . Also the curved lower part of the cradle that holds your Axim , et al , is a little under developed and if bumped will readily jettison what it 's holding . Other than that it works very well and never ceases to make me grin when everyone passing your table at Starbucks has to stop and ask you about it . I previously gave it one star , but now that it 's acclimated and working I give it 4 only because of the cradle shortcoming or else it would have been a full 5 . I know it shows one star , but Amazon whold n't allow me to edit the scale .	-1
I struggled with trying to get this thing to work with my Blackberry 8700g for some time . I even selected and downloaded a driver that was listed for Blackberry devices on the product web site . After a lot of frustration , I finally got my Blackberry to pair with the keyboard , but it would still not recognize it when I tried to get it to link to it . I contacted iGo product support and they informed me that : `` Unfortunately , we do not have a driver for that device currently . '' So , I ended up wasting a lot of time on this keyboard that is supposedly `` for Blackberry and other PDA/Handhelds . `` By the way , the carton itself does not state that it works with Blackberry devices , only with Smartphones . A fairly obscure barcode sticker on the back does indicate , in small letters , that it also works for Blackberry . In my case , though , back it goes , which really is a shame because I like the quality of the item otherwise and I am sure I could have made good use of it . In the mean time , I guess I 'll keep looking.Lastly , I also agree with the other reviewer who vented about the stupid sticker they place on the unit . It is glued to the keyboard and to the front surface and is quite a pain to remove .	-1
Pro'sUnit has great range.Comfortable in the ears , can wear it all day.Battery life is awesome.Mute function make this very useful for someone that spends a lot of time on the conference calls.Con'sLasted two months and now will not turn on anymore . Trying to get motorola to fix it , but no help so far.Audio books may have issues . The headset will cut out during short pauses and makes you lose out on a few seconds of the story as it reconnects . Only certain books caused this behavior.If it did not quit on me I would certainly recommend it as a phone headset .	-1
It wo n't work with my phone . After 2 hours , I got it to connect , but it wo n't answer when I get calls or turn on when I want to make them . Plus there were obvious scuff marks on the device . It 's made of cheap plastic and the charger has the old-fashioned two-prong adaptor . I 'm going to start looking for a better device ... especially one that charges with the universal USB adaptor so I do n't have to carry multiple cords with me .	-1
It 's a great deal , so i jumped on it . But was truly disappointed . I 've so far summed up Motorola products as well really really poor . I own a Razar , wish i could return that ! But this headset , thinking it 's from motorola would work well with my phone , but no . It 's on my belt clip , and the phone tell me that the bluetooth headset is 30 ft away , signal is weak , and then disconnets . To me that 's strange . It 's also surprising that this happens randomly , so it 's kinda annoying , b/c you ca n't anticipate it . Kinda annoying when driving , b/c you rely on the headset to work properly . Also get the static noise which is weird , b/c it should n't do that . especially when driving .	-1
a couple problems with this headset , when using it with the Treo 650 -1. it does not automatically connect when a call is received or initiated2 . the volume is way too lowcheck out the Jabra JX10 , Cardo Scala , or Palm Treo headset -- -- there are too many great headsets out there , to settle for this onehappy shopping !	-1
I am not impressed.I do n't know what the other reviewers are smoking . This device does not cancel out background noise . Listeners on the other end say I sound like I 'm in a tunnel . Two strikes.As you can see from the pictures there is quite a distance between one 's mouth and the `` pinhole '' for the internal microphone . There is no way to cancel out background noise lest your own voice be considered to be background noise . This is a defect in all devices that have a similar design.The earpiece is not suited for driving or walking . The `` ear attachment '' and its hinge is made of flimsy plastic . As a result the fit is n't tight enough . I often need to turn my head quickly while driving and it feels like the thing 's going to fly off my head into the back seat . It 's an extremely annoying distraction that you do n't want to have while driving.On the good side , I do n't have any problems hearing and the volume controls are very convenient to use .	-1
I 've used a number of Bluetooth headsets and this is among the worst . The sound quality is low , especially outdoors , and there is quite a bit of static even when within a few feet of the phone . The volume is poor - even with the volume cranked up to the top I could barely hear the other party indoors and outside ( with any background noise ) it was almost impossible . This is the result of the earpiece resting outside the ear rather than within the ear ( earbud style ) . The microphone is far enough from one 's mouth that it is difficult for the person with whom you are speaking to hear you.The fitting of the earpiece is also slightly uncomfortable , especially if you wear glasses , but not as bad as some others I 've tried . It does not flop around much under normal circumstances . I was also disappointed that this uses a proprietary power connector rather than mini-USB like the older H500 , which would have made it easier to charge with the same charger as my Razr.I thought this headset would be adequate for the price , but for someone who is serious about using a Bluetooth headset on a regular basis I 'm going to recommend either the Jabra BT500 or BT250 . I 've used those in the past and found them much better overall , and worth the extra price .	-1
I used have one of this earpeice 2 years ago and I lost it , so I ordered this since this is much much cheaper than my previous one.Different from the previous peice , this item came in with extremely cheap package and it 's sound quality is worse than my previous one . My friends complained about the ECHO and noise sometimes so I suspect if this is actually a refurbed one . Sometimes the manufacturer sell such items for much less with simplized packaging .	-1
The voice reception with this headset was just ok . Sometimes people on the other side had trouble hearing me sometimes especially when driving . I also get a tingling sensation around my ear and a mild ache in the outer part of my ear everytime I use it . It may be something to do with the design of the head set . Research has never proved any connection between using wireless or bluetooth and the impact on your nerves/brain , and I have to believe them ... It 's weird though that I get always get a tingling , achy sensation if I use a cell phone continuously for more than an hour but with the bluetooth I get the same sensation in about 20 minutes . So try as I might , I can not wear it for prolonged periods of time . After I used this headset for about 2 months it just died on me ! I used to charge it once every week and never left it on the charger for long periods - only till the blue light went off to show it had finished charging . I did this as other reviewers had warned against over-charging . However , now the headset just died ... after 2 months . I called Motorola and they agreed to replace it . It takes about 10-14 days from the time you send it in to get a new one . I 'm waiting for the replacement to come back . Who knows how long this one will last !	-1
This headset is actually not a bad deal but it is not a great deal either . The design of the unit does not lend itself to easy , long-term usage . It constantly falls off my ear and it is a power hog . I once got about 2 hours of usage from this device and that remains the record for battery life ( Oddly , it takes about two hours to charge this battery from empty ) . I am surprised that Motorola could n't get a better battery or somehow get more usage per charge.The upside is that sound quality is great when you can hear people on the other line ( the volume does n't go up very high ) . It 's one-push button operation to answer and hang up calls is great . Though it can sometimes be a little slow to register calls as I have received complaints that it takes me too long to answer the phone.Overall , I like the idea of bluetooth but I have n't found a great headset yet . I would recommend that you keep shopping around and if you do n't find anything else in the price range that you like , buy this one but beware of the limitations.There is one other upside : I once accidentally used the charger that came with my wife 's Motorola V276 phone to charge my headset . When I compared the two chargers , they were identical .	-1
and i 'm fairly disappointed ! i bought this little gem at a cingular kiosk in the mall for $ 80 and i am thinking it 's going back before my 30 days are up ! in summary , considering bluetooth still has some improvements to make , this is just NOT worth $ 80 , period . even if this device worked flawlessly , it might be worth about $ 30 at best.here are my gripes : * it says it has a range of about 30 feet . hmmm ... not really . i am even using this headset with a motorola phone ( V505 ) and i can get about 20 feet away from it at best before the audio quality goes south . not the biggest deal in the world . even when i am close to the phone however , there can be some interferance ( `` crackling '' ) and distortion . usually mild though . it seems like my microwave interferes with it ( when it 's cooking ) ! * does n't fit snugly on my ear . rather , it kind of `` hangs '' there . it does n't have any kind of mechanism for adjustment , so here 's hoping it fits your ear . using this headset while lying down is hard to do ; the device does n't seem to want to stay put . * drops the bluetooth connection every now and again , even when i am at close range.the `` good '' : * looks cool ! ; ) * battery life seems to be pretty good . * small , lightweighti am going to look into some other options . this simply was a waste of money .	-1
The audio is very soft of this headset . I have to use one hand to push it against my ear each time I want to use it . Also , it is always checking to make sure it is still connected to the phone , so it beeps every 5 to 10 seconds .	-1
I bought this from Amazon . I linked quickly and worked as advertised . I found the various button modes difficult to keep track of and found it a real problem over time.My biggest complaint is that this device is too too quiet at maximum volume . Obviously Motorola did not test their design in a car that had some road noise . I found it only adequate in a quiet room . I suspect it is the fact that the speaker is a long way from the ear canal . I am wondering if an in ear type will be better in the long run.Save you money on this one if you plan to use it in a car . It is fine if your sitting in quiet room .	-1
This thing just does n't work well with the Treo 6501. it does n't automatically connect , when a call comes , or when a call is initiated2 . the volume is way too lowthe comfort is good , but for the price , there are many BETTER headsets out there -- -- consider the Cardo Scala , the Jabra JX10 , and the Palm Treo headset - those are your best betshappy shopping !	-1
Lasted 3 months , lucky I have two ( charge one , while using the other ) , the units last only for about 2-3 hours of use , hardly good for all day jobs.Like the fit though , but These items need to last the day .	-1

This headset seems to work fine , but the audio quality is nothing to write home about , to the person on the other end of the line you will sound soft and like you are talking on a speakerphone . They will also hear a lot of background noise . I am much happier with the Cardo Scala 500 Bluetooth headset . It has much better audio quality and even comes with more stuff for about the same price.And , you may not really *need* a wireless bluetooth headset because you can just use a wired one or use your speakerphone . But I admit that it 's sort of cool to be totally wireless-you can put the phone in your pocket or purse and be totally unencumbered by wires , which feels a bit safer and freer , especially while driving or when you have to work with both hands and talk at the same time for example.A note about the battery-do not store this unit ( or your phone ) in a hot car ! Heat damages batteries and shortens their lifespan .	-1
Do n't purchase these if you plan to use in your car . The side walls are too thin and if this lays next to any 12 power source , my Sirus Radio in my case , you 'll get the electrical whine as the cars rpm 's increase and decrease . You get what you pay for .	-1
Received it , plugged it in , did n't work . Tried jostling the cable and plug around , could n't get it to work . Ca n't recommend it .	-1
Bought this as a line-in cable for my in-dash stereo from my cell phone . The cable does not work . I only get sound out of one side of the stereo when it 's fully plugged in . In order to hear stereo , i need to hold cable out to before the spring click . Unfortunately this does n't suit my needs for the car .	-1
it 's the worst cell phone I had to date.1 this phone has 1 to 2 second delay when buttons are pressed.2 because of slow button key I kept doing and unding key lock/unlock several times to actually call anyone.3 . battery life is only about 48hrs ( standby ) and defintly not 200 some minutes as what this phone 's spec says.4 . phonebook is pretty messedup . phone book name displys only first half of first line , although it allows you to enter two lines.5 . on/off button some times takes second try.6 . it 's not straight forward to save work/home/mobile ... under one name.7 . phone charger connection is so flimsy that in certain position it wo n't charge . design is pretty messed up.8 . 1/8 '' of color lcd screen is already dying only after 5 month of useage.9 . signal is very poor . I 'm sure this lot more to do with Tmobile.Basically slow and unintuitive phone.Bright side of all this is that Tmobile contact is only for one year .	-1
I have placed these in several of my phones since they first came out in the 1990s . I know that they made a big difference in my older phones that had physical antennae & # 8217 ; s which needed to be pulled out of the phone . Since the phone antennae & # 8217 ; s have changed , I haven & # 8217 ; t been able to notice any significant improvements with these installed or without them . I install them now because I got some for free and this is probably what they are now worth . The level of improved reception is about as noticeable as the loss of cash that I paid to get these free signal boosters .	-1
This item does nothing to enhance the signal in your phone , I followed the instructions and applied the antenna as stated but no change in the signal strength . I guess that 's the reason why they 're selling so cheap . Do not waste your time with this product .	-1
Did n't work for my Galaxy S3 SPH-L710 so in case you have this same phone or just a Galaxy S3 ( Verison , AT & T , T-Mobile ) does n't matter . It wont work .	-1
This does not work at all . And once you put it on it is so hard to took off . Never again ! ! ! !	-1
I PUT THIS PRODUCT IN MY PHONE AND HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DIFFERENCE IN MY SIGNAL STRENGTH AT ALL . I BOUGHT SOME BEFORE AND THEY ACTUALLY HELPED BUT THESE DID NOT .	-1
these things are ajoke they do nothing for the phone but for the price it was a fun thing to try . but really not worth a dime	-1
you do not get a 6 pack you only get 1 of them do not be fooled i was very upset that it only came with one and i do not liked to be tricked like that	-1
We 've had the Sidekick II for about two months . Although my 11-year-old likes it for its buttons and Gee Whiz value , I find it very awkward to use as a phone . It does n't have a normal keyboard , so you must flip the screen up to press the keys , then flip the screen back down to listen and talk . When you get into a voicemail situation , you have to keep flipping the screen up to `` press 1 for English '' , etc . Very annoying.You also must pay an additional $ 20 per month if you want to browse the Internet , use Instant Messaging , or even Download Fun . Otherwise , all you get is phone calls and text messaging ( which is also extra ) . Even the non-sidekick phones let you get T-Zones for Instant Messaging as a $ 5.00 option.Another gripe is that the phone is falling apart after two months of not very rough usage . The screen no longer slips into place when flipped open and the letter `` A '' has fallen out . It occasionally just freezes for no reason . The first phone I received froze up the first day and had to be replaced.The battery is built into the phone , so you ca n't take it out to let the phone reset itself . No such thing as having an extra battery on a trip , for example.Internet browsing is cool , but so slow you think it stopped working . I think some of the fault is just the slow connection , but the other part of the fault is that the phone seems to take a long time to actually build the web page it 's trying to display.Oh , yeah . Another problem is that T-Mobile expects you to pay $ 9.95 to set up your album on its web site , then 29 cents for each photo you upload to it.The phone is too large and heavy and has poor quality voice reproduction . You ca n't use wallpaper and the ring tones sound terrible.Although it looks good on paper , it is n't really ready for prime time .	-1
Sidekick II is meant to be your one-stop-shop wireless gadget for e-mailing , web-browsing and IM chatting anywhere you go . You can also download limited content . You can also sync with your Outlook calendar and addressbook , but only if you pay extra for a third-party utiltiy program . Compared to the original Sidekick , SK II is thinner but quite a bit longer . I also think it 's uglier , esp . the new thumb keyboard , but the keyboard is still very useable . Battery life is terrible after the first couple weeks , requiring you to carry the charger with you all the time.The problem with the whole T-Mobile data service , though , is the poor quality of T-Mobile 's GPRS coverage . T-Mobile is infamous for its sporadic GSM ( voice ) coverage in the U.S . When it comes to GPRS ( data ) , it 's even worse , and the slightest degradation in reception will cause the Sidekick to go kaputt . And when that happens , SK has a tendency to fail to re-establish the data connection when signal strength returns . This makes a very frustrating user experience , esp . when you need Internet access the most ( e.g. , when you want to log onto amazon.com to compare-shop that big Sharp Aquos LCD TV you are looking at inside a Best Buy store ) . Unfortunately , T-Mobile has not improved its coverage or download speed , so if you get the SK , be prepared for slow speed and lost connections . Once the novelty factor wears off , the SK experience is a rather stressful one.Of course , currently no other device - not even the Treo 600 - has the same portable form factor and useable keyboard as the SK II . If you are an absolutely Internet junkie , you 'll probably find T-Mobile 's abysmal coverage tolerable and SK 's true wireless Internet access appealing .	-1
I regret buying this phone , it 's really big , and verizon service is n't that great with this phone . For some reason other verizon phones have like 3 bars when mine has 1 , or will have 1 bar when i 'm getting no service . That said , the phone does have a beautiful inner LCD , the outer LCD is pretty bad . You can play with the settings . It has loads of features like alarms and calanders and everything else you could think of . The camera is terrible , which is pretty much true with all cell phones though , so that 's a non unique gripe . The phone is also moderately fruity , like when you make or recieve calls , the outer LED will start blinking purple , blue , pink etc and it makes you look like a teenage girl , and the menus are all kind of childish . That said , when the phone does have some bars , calls never drop and it 's pretty easy to set up the phone . I 'm not sure what other options there are out there for verizon cell phones , i recently switched from tmobile , but im sure you can do better than this phone , good luck .	-1
I get significant transmission static with this headset with my I-mate Sp3i unless I point the phone directly at the headset from a few feed away . It has static if I put the phone in my shirt pocket ! Since I have n't done a baseline test of the phone with other bluetooth headsets , I ca n't say if it is the headset or the phone , but either way , if you buy one of these and have the same problem , make sure and return it within the return period.Another problem is the plastic ear holder ( the part that holds the headset to your ear ) . This is a bad design and honestly , there is no way to get this thing to properly and confortably fit my ear . The only way to wear it is to have half your ear lobe hanging out , which result in a lot of pain within 10min or so . Avoid this headset if you want wear a headset for extended periods of time.A final note : The wind blocking technology works well , but at the expense of a high quality sound transmission to your recipent . I 've asked a few of my techno-geek-friends when I 'm talking to them with the headset , and they all say that the sound quality seems to be missing a full dynamic range.Good luck !	-1
the `` behind the ear '' thing just broke ... I baby my stuff and treat it VERY lightly , and this piece of junk just fell apart ! ! ! Very dissapointed ! ! ! I should have made my additions to this review long ago , but Logitech cam through for me on this headset in a huge way ! They immediately sent me a replacement of the headset , but not just a replacement , an $ 85 replacement ! Then told me to keep the broken one , which I was able to fix with some Krazy Glue ! Really incredible customer support ... I will never hesitate to buy something branded with the Logitech name ! BTW , 5 stars on the earpiece itself once it was repaired with the glue .	-1
I 'm a great believer in spending as little as possible on glitz , bells and whistles , and generally go for performance and practicality . Sound quality and features are fine for the price . But the unit is quite difficult to wear -- the boom is wide and boxy ; the weight is unbalanced , as well . I could not get a comfortable fit . My ear is well within normal range of size and shape , but was bent out of shape by the headset.On the positive , wind noise and lost connections -- common criticisms of other BT headsets -- was not a problem here . If you do n't care about medium to long term fit and comfort , or the aesthetics of walking around with such an large unit hanging off your ear , you may be happy with this headset . I was n't , and am returning it . I 'm going to give the Cardo Scala a try ; if it 's no good , I 'll probably go with a Jabra , and spend a bit more money .	-1
The sound quality was excellent , but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable : terrific electrical engineering , poor mechanical engineering.I loved it when it was n't broken . Even wind did n't seem to bother the headset much . The voice quality was great on transmission and reception . But the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and ca n't be replaced . I got a new headset the first time on warranty . The second time it broke I could have gotten a free replacement again but I did n't want the hassle . I have a Scala now that I 've been using for months and I 'm very happy with it , even though the sound and wind-immunity does n't measure up to the Logitech .	-1
It says it 's compatible with all Motorola handsets ... It does n't work at all with Motorola/Giant Talkabout FRS/GMRS/CB 2-way radios having 2.5mm jacks . Very disappointing .	-1
Set it up , it worked great for a little over 24 hours and the base unit failed to connect to my laptop . Returned and purchased a different item . Did n't want to take the business risk of replacing with the same thing . Ca n't afford to be offline for as long as it will take to get this replaced.To be fair , I have used several Plantronics headsets and they were all great ... my all time favorite is now 10+ years old and not compatible with Google Voice ( though it does work great with Cisco IP phone ) . I also have a bluetooth Plantronics Voyager headset for my iPhone and it is also very good .	-1
I have had this phone almost 6 weeks ( 40 days ) . At 3 weeks the middle row of keys stopped working ( a , s , d , f , and g , etc ) . I was told to call Palm in India , which I did , and they told me the keys were not covered under warranty.I truly wish I were making this up , because I have really loved Palm . This is my fourth Palm device , though it will likely be my last . I run a small real estate company which works with wireless telecom providers throughout the nation . My hope for this device was that I could stop carrying three devices ( my cell phone , my Palm T3 and my laptop ) . And then , that all my guys could stop carrying all these devices around.Of course , when I took the phone to Sprint , they said it was Palm 's responsibility to repair . When I raised a stink with them they just looked at me with blank eyes , as they always do . Sprint seems like they are in the business of trying to run customers off.I called India back and raised enough of a stink , that they said they would give me - this one time - a `` free return and repair , '' meaning I would be without my phone for 5-10 business days . They also gave me the option of paying them an additional $ 25 to get a refurbished replacement , complete with a 90-day warranty ( which I now know means nothing ) . These people honestly acted like they were doing me the biggest favor by offering me this repair.I was then effectively called a liar by Palm / India when I had to re-emphasize that the keys just do n't work , and that I needed something immediately . I do n't understand how I can be made to feel like a criminal when I deal with these people , or how I can be made to feel like they 're doing me a favor by standing behind their product . I am the customer ! Does n't that mean anything anymore ? I am also not sure I understand how customer service in general has become so bad ( though Amazon 's remains very , very good ) . When a person spends $ 400 on a phone , or any device , it should work longer than a few weeks . But when it does stop working , the company that sold it should stand behind their product , instead of looking for ways to squirrel out of their responsibility . Subsequent to this occurrence , other friends / colleagues have told me how they had problems with their Treo 650s , as well.There are other issues with this phone . Out of the box , the power/sync cord did not work . I returned that to Sprint and got a tremendous hassle in trying to get it replaced . ( I ended up buying a Seidio charger/cradle , which works fine . ) The sound is pretty bad - I am constantly having to adjust the volume . Every so often , the phone just resets itself - ca n't figure this one out at all . Also , when someone calls in on Call-Waiting , you can not disconnect your active call without disconnecting the incoming call ; in other words , when you accept the Call-Waiting call , it automatically means two calls will run simultaneously , even when the first party hangs up . This plays heck on your monthly minutes.Also , there are limited , non-intuitive ways you have to power on the phone . And do n't get this phone for its camera : cell phone cameras are only good for placing pictures on that cell phone.Otherwise , all the Palm applications work as they should , and as they have for the past number of years . Expect nothing new and different from the Palm OS part of the Treo.All in all , I am firm in my opinion that I will never own another Palm device . My company will stop using Palm , and we are going to slowly migrate away from Sprint ( when contracts start to expire ) .My apologies for the rant , but it simply seems that these companies have become much bigger than their customers . Excuse me if I just let them move on without me.Are there any companies out there that provide good customer service anymore ? I know mine tries to ; otherwise , we 're out of business .	-1
I purchased the Scala 500 as my first BT headset and I regret it . The company is v-e-r-y slow to respond to email messages to their support box , so call them , do n't write.While the sound quality of the unit is very , very good , there are other issues with the unit . First , the fit on my particular ear is horrible ... always feeling like it was going to fall off . I never trusted it walking through airports as it just did n't feel secure.Second , the unit literally fell apart in my hands after three or four months . The portion that protrudes gently into my ear came loose , then broke off . I note that others have metioned the same thing . It just was n't well constructed . Bummer ! I 've replaced it now with another low-cost unit made by Plantronics , but while I miss the sound quality of the Cardo , I am disappointed by their slow support and poor quality .	-1
Let me say up front that I ordered this from Amazon after reading all the glowing reviews , and I 've been fairly disappointed by the performance I 've experienced . My experience was specific to using the Scala with Sprint 's LG-PM325.First , the audio quality was not good . If my phone was lying on a piece of furniture within two feet of the headset , I could usually get passable quality and occassionally get clear reception . Any other scenario resulted in garbled audio . When using the headset with my phone , while the phone was in my front pocket , the audible was unacceptable and barely discernable . And it 's not by hearing.Second , there 's the shiny blue light . When I read other 's comments about the flashing blue LED , I really did n't think much of it . But in the dark , this thing is a strobe light . At night , with my headset left on some countertop downstairs , and while I was upstairs , I could see the flash of blue reflected off my second story ceiling . That 's part A . Part B , the flash results in a very slight audible clicking , not unlike when a camera flash goes off . Which means if you use this thing at night while lying in silence , be prepared for a constant audible and visible reminder that you 're wearing the Scala.Battery life was good . Pairing was excellent . The piece stayed on my head pretty well and comfortably , and making or answering calls was straightforward.I 've returned mine because of the two problems .	-1
I specifically ordered this headset because of the eye glass clip . When I received the order , the clip would not fit on my glasses , and appeared to be of extreme poor contstruction ( the type you would expect out of a Craker Jack box ) .The headset would required pressing the button to answer a call several times before it would actually pick up the call.The product is in the process of being returned to Amazon.com .	-1
Let me begin this review by stating that a lot of people have used this device quite successfully . As for me , there were two main problems . First , I found the sound level to be too low . While it 's easy enough to turn up the volume , the problem lies in the microphone being so close that it causes a major echo for the person on the other end . The second problem I had was that I was never able to transfer a call from the device to the phone . I tried to use this model for a couple weeks just to make sure but , after that time , I decided to send it back and keep looking .	-1
I am using this device with a Polycom landline phone.Trying the 3 settings I can get a decent connection on my end with a separate Bluetooth earpiece , where I hear the other party fine with little noise and no echo.But on the far end , even landline to landline , there is an annoying whine and some echo , no matter what the setting . This is n't good enough , I prefer to use the corded headset.I am returning this product to Amazon .	-1
I bought , exchanged , and then returned this unit . Both units delivered to me would not turn on . When I charged them using the supplied adaptor , the red charging light came on and a few hours later , the unit was supposedly fully charged . However , when I attempted to turn the unit on by pressing the power button , nothing happened . The unit never came on , could not be paired , and never worked . I returned both of them . I can understand one unit being bad , but two units that were shipped several weeks apart should n't be.When I called for technical support , I waited on hold for sometime , and then gave up .	-1
I bought this item @ a local retailer , was happy cause i got it on sale ( probobly clearance ) well it worked 2 days then the wire going into the unit it self would get static if touched ! I can not find my receipt , so i e-mailed jabra & they are acting like this is n't an issue ! wanting to know how many phones i tried , if i tried more than 1 headset , etc ... . i will prolly get no where or if they do accept a return the S & H Charges will be stupid & not worth replacement ! Just get a nice wired headset , less $ spent & less headache !	-1
I could NOT get it charge . Did not sent it back because it would cost more to ship it back than I paid for it . I ask for help on this and got no where . But I did order Nokia BL-5C and it works great .	-1
It was because I could no longer obtain good quality BL-5C 's that I finally gave up my Nokia phone.I think the last battery I tried in it was one of these , it actually had worse performance than the battery I had used for a year and was trying to replace.These might be phonies from China or just so old that they are chemically inert , but I am afraid I ca n't recommend these .	-1
Got this is a timely mannor , put it in my phone , chatged for 12+ hours and nothing ! Never worked ! Annoyed to say the least ! I ordered this just in time to go into the hospital for a ce section so i wouldnt have to charge my phone all that often considering bending and such will be painfull . A lot of good it did me .	-1
I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500 . Therefore , I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement , and last night i needed it . I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work . I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing ( not one indicator light ) . I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger , it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked ; unfortunately , i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head . Consequently , this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase , i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore , the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet . I learned a valuable lesson .	-1
The device was not as the description . It looked as if someone dropped it off their vehicle and it hit the road and skidded all the way down . I was VERY disappointed when opening it b/c it was the first thing I seen other than the front damage.I did email the seller and told them and they were very nice and refunded me as I returned the product back to them .	-1
was very unhappy with this it didnt work no time i had got it for my husband and i haven heard the last of it from him	-1
This Bluetooth sucks . Plain and simple ... I mean I paid , what , $ 15 for the thing so was n't expecting the best but at least working quality . I always buy the Motorola H730 or H750 which are upwards of $ 60 but I always lose them . Always ! It is a curse so I figured I would get a rinky-dink cheap one so I would n't cry in the corner losing out on a day & # 8217 ; s worth of work pissed and distraught over losing my ( what is this my 6th ) Bluetooth . But with every call - EVERY ONE - it was unbearable static on my end so much so that everyone mentioned it . Hell , even the recorded lady on the voicemail was like this thing sucks ! So yeah just spend the extra cash and go up a few grades because this was a lost cause .	-1
I origanally purchased this phone thinking it had voice dialing similar to the motorola v710 . Unfortunately is uses the old style of voice dial where you have to train your voice for each phonebook entry . The v710 does not require this and utilizes true speech recognition software . Since this was the most important feature to me I am returning the razr and exchanging it for the v710 . To bad , the razr is superior in most other categories except the one most importand to me . If it had true nex technology voice recogition I would keep it .	-1
Bought this phone with Cingular service . I needed the phone in a hurry . I checked my order next day , had this weird message : '' Order RevisionOrder placed October 08 , 2005 at 10:35 PM PDTOpen order -- your order revision requiredhas not approved you for any phone and service plan packages . Please cancel necessary phone and service plan packages from your order . We can not proceed with your order without some action on your part . Please be aware that if you do not take action on this item within 5 DAYS , it will be cancelled from your order.Cancel necessary phone and service plan packages '' I had no idea what this cryptic message meant , but essentially they were requiring me to cancel the order . I have three cell phones in my family , perfect credit , no earthly reason why I would n't be approved for a cell phone account , just the above message with no explanation . Of course , there is no one at Amazon to call for an explanation . I do n't know if my form was missing some information , or something was mistyped - no idea at all what happened . I think that if Amazon was going to cancel my order , they need to explain it to me.I have bought from Amazon before , usually good service , but this is just awful.I think that Amazon is in over their heads in the cell phone business.From other comments , it sounds like Amazon is not being fully honest or transparent in their cell phone ads .	-1
My wife and I each purchased V551s with our migration to Cingular 6 months ago . In that time ( during which the phone was never dropped , bumped , etc ) , I 've replaced my phone twice , and hers once . The problems we 've had include : - random `` white screen of death '' - Bluetooth connectivity problems ( isolated to phones ) - dropped calls in perfect reception areas- random battery indications- the infamous `` Unable to Charge '' problemAdd to that Motorola 's lousy phonebook and UI , and retarded Bluetooth handling ( e.g. , if any BT device is connected , the same Moto default ring sounds , regardless of sound profile or caller-specific ringtones ) , and you have an overpriced , overhyped , oversize paperweight.I 'm fortunate Cingular offers my company 's employees discounts on new phones , so that I can go back to Sony Ericsson . My old T616 gave me 2 years of perfect service , even after having been dropped twice . It 's on its 2nd owner now , who has used it for 6 months problem-free .	-1
My chief complaint with this phone is that the Ringtone selector is accessible from the outside of the phone which causes it to be changed when simply handling it or fiddling with it in your pocket . There have been numerous times where i have missed calls because it was inadverdantly set to silent just from being pulled out of my pocket ! The rest of the complaints are from the poor and confusing Motorola software and menu structure . This phone does quite a bit but rarely can i find how to access these features even after months of ownership and i have owned several other Motorola phones before . I often am talking and am buried in some inscrutable set of menu 's when i am trying to do something else like activate bluetooth or find a number in the phonebook The software is also slow and unresponsive compared to Nokia or Samsung which gives it a lazy and inexact feel . Some of the pluses are the rubberized finish which is easy to grip , full support for bluetooth ( although bluetooth sucks up so much battery power that it becomes borderline useless ) and nice large well lit keys and crisp screen.The phone has an overall feeling of solidity without being too heavy or clumsy feeling . I have gotten more drops on this phone than any other but i have never used cingular before so i do n't know whether its the service or phone . Overall i want to like the phone but i 'm searching for something else as the frustrations arent worth it .	-1
Does n't stay on even if you figure out how to get it on . The ear plug piece is big and bulky and then you ca n't hear . The mouth piece is way too short so no one can hear you talk over the car and road noise . The cord is too short and there is not volume control on the cord with is inconvenient . Get the Bluetooth and give up the wire .	-1
This fell apart after one use , and the person I called could n't even hear me when it was n't broken to pieces . VERY disappointed ! : (	-1
This model , the C150 , is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered . I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used , however , all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality . With each one , the persons on the other end could not hear me . Disappointed . I found that it worked well with a cell phone , but not with a cordless phone .	-1
I screwed up ; should n't have ordered this ; it 's of no use to me . Since the real price was hidden in the `` shipping and handling '' it 's pointless to return it ; I 'll just write it off as an `` educational expense '' .I actually bought this to use on a cordless handset that had a `` hands free '' 2.5mm jack . ( Siemens cordless phone system ) . The owners manual says `` ... any 2.5 mm headset '' , so that 's what I bought . I do n't even know where this thing is anymore ; I put it back in the little bag and forgot about it.I tried it on three of the handsets in the system ; the plug simply captures the line and makes a loud , `` screeching '' sound ... ... playing with the plug , I can find one tenuous position about a quarter of the way out where I can hear audio from the phone , but the moment I let it slip it goes back to the screeching.I ca n't get it to work on anything else either including my wife 's Samsung Intensity ( which also has a 2.5mm headset jack ; same results ) , but I do n't have access to a PalmEvery so often I do something stupid ; buying this was one of those occasions .	-1
These did not work since the day I got them.The right earbud never had sound.I got a replacement , and it 's the same situation.I am not sure if it 's because I 'm using a Nokia E71x , but they both do n't work properly .	-1
There 's a problem with the design of this headset . The jack used is too short . It 's EXTREMELY sensitive to movement . If you do n't have it plugged in ALL THE WAY and keep it still , you 'll loose the connection . I do n't know why they designed it that way ...	-1
I does n't hold a charge for very long which is to be expected for an inexpensive battery . You really do get what you pay for , do n't you ?	-1
This is the 3rd `` OEM '' battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others , it was terrible . I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50 . They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time . It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge . Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery -- - not OEM . How can you tell ? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan . These say clearly that they are made in china . I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues . There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk , counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it . For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time . My time is worth more than th $ 10 I get ripped off for . But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers . AMAZON 's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth . Well AMAZON , you can start here : Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders , Wireless Phone Accessories and now the OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $ 30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit . So it has nothing to do with the price paid . Just dishonest online sellers .	-1
They are probably old batteries sitting on a shelf by the time we got them . Not much better than the old ones I was replacing .	-1
I purchased three of these batteries and each one would not last through one day in standby ( not making calls ) before it went dead . I thought I had a problem with my RAZR V3M so I took it in and was informed that these batteries do not have enough milliamps required for the RAZR . They replaced it with the correct battery and I have been using that one now for over a year with no problem .	-1
I agree with other reviews ... people who talk to me hear a horrible echo due to the mic picking up the earspeakers sound ... even if I set the earspeaker to the lowest volume . I 'm glad it came free with my phone , because if I 'd payed for this ... I 'd be pretty mad .	-1
Summary : Stay away , this product sports a very poor design ... Pro : + very low price+ very small and lightweight+ relatively easy to use+ pair up well with all my BT phonesCon : - morse-code like feedback signal - they try to accomplish too many tasks with single beep/tone . 1 short beep , 2 short beeps , 3 short beeps , 1 long beep , 3 beeps up , 3 beeps down . like another reviewer said , you really have to read the manual or keep it nearyby to be able to understand what all the beeping means.- echos no matter what volume you set it , partly because this thing is very loud- insanely difficult to open the battery door . I got so frustrated , I was about to throw this thing out of the window . For a product that use regular batteries , the battery door is the most difficult to open . Once opened , you need a pair of tweazers to pull the battery out . The battery compartment is very deep and extremely snug . This must be a sick joke by Motorola . Forget about changing the battery on the go , you need to sit down and have a few tools and a lot of patience . ( for the record : this was my breaking point , i had to return this unit , because installing the battery for the first time was enough of a turn-off ) - sound quality is mediocre at best	-1
Quality and value of this item are fine , but WHOA , it smells SO BAD ! ! Just like bug spray ! I returned it promptly .	-1
I tried putting my Galaxy S4 in the case and it kept popping out . It seems like the plastic casing is too small for the phone . Very disappointed .	-1
Its cheap the wristlet is like a little thread and not sturdy at all . You have to clip your uncased phone into the plastic backing attached 5o the purse . Money part needs length to really pack some cash in . Id like a better cash compartment which is one thing I wanted in my purchase . Id say purchase a cheaper product like this . Id the wristlet breaks and im positive it will your product is pointless . Buyer be aware . Update . I stopped using this . The same day I got this my phone was kind of stuck in it and without thinking I was madly pulling at it . Needless to say my note 2 went flying and cracked the screen to pieces . Just be careful handling your phone since this privides no protection and can be tough to disengage from the phone .	-1
I bought this for my daughter to use on her vacation cruise . The magnetic clasp erased her room card and credit card . Kind of defeats the purpose of the clutch . It might be ok if you just used your drivers license phone and cash but people do n't really carry cash and to have to have a credit or bank card reissued is problematic .	-1
i returned it because it came dented . I like it , wish i could have used it . They said i got the last one .	-1
I got the product very fast and it looks and feels great one the phone . However it did interfere with my cellular signal and brought my bars down from 3 to 1 and sometimes none . I started dropping calls and the people on the other line said I was fading in and out when I was able to talk to someone . I took the cover off my Note 2 and my bars popped back up to 3 and I had no problems with phone calls anymore . I tried it again to make sure it was the cover , and sure enough it did the same thing as before . I had my partner try it as he has the same kind of phone and it did the same thing to his Note 2 . So I had to return the case for a refund . It is disappointing because it was a great looking case .	-1
Not a very well made case , thought it would be of better quaility , hard to tell from just looking at it on the site .	-1
This product was pretty inexpensive so I had no expectations . When I received it I quickly noticed how flimsy the plastic was . You can probably fit 2 credit cards top . Might be a good case for nights out , but probably wont protect your phone much . I ended up tossing it because it was too flimsy .	-1
The case took almost a week to arrive . You buy a cheap case , you 're going to get cheap case quality . Stay away . The inside of the case that contacts the phone is not smooth at all . Will scratch your phone . Looks as if someone dropped it in dirt . Could not clean whatever gunk was on the case . Thank God it did n't scratch the aluminium on the case . A credit card did n't even slide all the way down into the case . Good luck trying to fit two in there . Spend your money else where .	-1
The phone does not fit into this junky case properly . Completely worthless and just a money grab by the seller . It was cheap with the coupon code because it does n't fit ! I tossed this case is in the trash where it belongs . I realize purchasing a cheap case is a gamble , but I never expected it be so bad that it does n't even fit the phone . Completely useless .	-1
its a worst product I have ever seen by motorola . It charges my phone but I have to hold the jack that goes into phone , and also have to drive at same time.I bought Belkin 's similar product from Walmart for $ 10 and it rocks .	-1
I bought one of these and the second time I plugged it in the light on the end went out and it stopped working ! This thing is junk , there is no way to replace the fuse ( if there is one ) without destroying it . I tried to take it apart , but you ca n't without breaking it . If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design . Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it ? ? ? I have NEVER had a problem with a car charger in the 10+ years I have owned a cell phone , that should tell you something ! How do you screw one up ? ! You hire the idiot who designed this one thats how !	-1
This is the 8th headset I have tried . Most of the ones I have purchased work very well with a cell phone , but not so good on a cordless phone . Same with this set ... Very comfortable to wear . I can hear those I call really well . Those that I call need to be able to hear me too ! The volume on this mic is better than most I have tried , but is still low . If you are talking to clients on the phone all day , this is important . I have a good Panasonic cordless phone and have yet to find a headset to use with it that has a strong volume . Still looking .	-1
OMG this has got to be the smallest piece of junk I have ever paid for : ) really this charger died 2 weeks after I pluged it into my car.the charger itself is made of cheap plastic , light weight and just down right worthless . the 2 weeks I had it pluged in , it never gave my phone a full charge , i drove 63 miles with it pluged into my phone and yet still did not fully charge it.guess you get what you pay for.so if you want more , then you 'll have to pay more .	-1
I like how it just barely sticks out from the cigarette plug on my Passat , so I can close the cover when I do n't have my phone chord plugged in.Even on the 2.1 port , the charger can not keep up with an iphone 5S . With every thing off on the iphone ( air plane mode , screen off , etc ) , it gave a 15 % charge in 2 hours . That 's 7.5 % per hour.When using Waze GPS the charge drops from 100 % to 90 % in 10 minutes.I would not recommend this charger .	-1
I can have this plugged in from Atlanta to Greensboro and the phone is n't much more charged than when I started . But the phone does n't die , either .	-1
used for 1 month before it broke - also not 2.1 amps - both usb slots do not produce enough current for sgs4	-1
Product quality of this item is very , very poor . After charging my phone for 15 minutes the charger began to overheat and the charge on my phone started to fail . Had to return this item for refund .	-1
I love my Kindle Fire , but I hate the micro plug.when plugging in a charger cord , I find that sometimes it does n't recognize that the plug is in and sometimes I have to jiggle it a little to get the charging box to turn green to show that it is , in fact , charging . I can not stand the A/C wall charger that came with the Fire . It is ridiculously short making it very difficult to find a place to charge it safely and I have purchased several of these cords since last Christmas and a majority work for a while and then break or do n't work at all . Sometimes it is hit or miss and then sometimes a cord charges and then sometimes it acts up and refuses to charge . I have the same plug on my Samsung Stratosphere and I do n't seem to have the same problem.With this cord the part that plugs into the Fire virtually fell apart . I do n't care how much you pay for one of these type of cord , they should all work . When I started using it , this cord `` appeared '' on my visual inspection to be well made , but I guess looks are deceiving . The cord , of course , fell apart after the return date so I 'm stuck.I really do n't recommend this cord . I realize that it could be just a single defective one , but , of the three other reviews , only one person out of four of us recommended this cord . So just beware .	-1
When I bought these , I thought they 'd fast charge a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 , but they do n't . They will slow charge . I have tried multiple cables , including the original Samsung cable which allows for a fast charge , but found this did n't help . Somewhere I read that they have to be specially configured to fast charge a Samsung device or otherwise they 'll charge slowly despite which port of the charger you use .	-1
I had a previous version of this product a few years ago . It lasted for about two year until a capacitor blew out . You could see it through the translucent case . I like the previous version . This one not so much.The AC prongs do not fold in so they are in the way when being used in a lighter outlet or stored in a pocket or computer back.It 's larger than the combination of some separate ac only and 12v only chargers I have , so there is no space savings.When connected to my ipad or my razr maxx , the screen keyboard malfunctions . Spurious and random characters are generated when the screen is touched instead of the keys that should be detected . Unplugging the cable immediately stops this problem.I contacted BoxWave and they did send me a return shipping label . I have not gotten around to returning the charger yet . I dont know if this is a design issue or if I just got a bad unit . But the first two issues are reasons I would not recommend these even if the malfunction is just a bad unit .	-1
Bought this to use in our brand new 2014 Nissan Altima . From the first time we plugged it in , it only worked if we jiggled it just right . Definitely not a 2.0 amp charger either . Will spend the extra dough to get one directly from the T-Mobile retailer . Not worth the return shipping cost for a refund . Only buy this if you feel like donating some money to a foreign company in Asia , just for fun .	-1
This case looks *FANTASTIC* , seriously . It 's easily one of the classiest , most beautiful cases I 've ever owned for a phone . The leather is great , it feels comfortable , it 's just a seriously awesome case.The problem is , I want to use it as a basic wallet as well , and it fails miserably at that . The entire case is so tight you can hardly fit your cards in ( I only want 3 cards and my drivers license . The fit is so tight you can barely get them in , once you do , the case does n't close very well over the phone.I guess I could go back to a wallet , but I really did n't want to do that . I wanted to use this as a `` pick up my phone and my car keys and go '' arrangement . No more fumbling for wallet , but this can not fit that bill . This case would have been far better off leaving all the extra storage out , and letting it close nicely . Overall , this case is wasted for me , just does n't cut it , even though I so badly wanted it to .	-1
It is not leather , and its smell is atrocious . However , if you 're okay with leatherette , it does have some nice pockets inside and it 's relatively thin/lightweight.I 'd avoid this seller though ( BoxWave Corp ) . Shipping is $ 5 and you will pay to return the item to them . For me , it was a total waste of money as the shipping costs alone are likely far more than the product is worth . I paid $ 30 for the case , $ 5 for shipping to me . I 'll be sending it flat rate back . Bear Mountain cases are better , real leather , and cost less ( about $ 20 for the iPad Mini ) .	-1
This Classic Book iPhone case is flimsy and the cover will not remain closed . Not good protection for an iPhone .	-1
I used the Motorola H500 before and the sound clarity is not as good as the Jabra BT250v . So I bought this product June 30 to replace my H500 . Received it July 11th . The person in the other end of the line noticed that I sounded clearer and louder . Used it while driving to test sound clarity and it passed . My Jabra250v was just used for minutes of light usage ( 3 hours max in 7 days ) , but the headphone stopped working August 15 . The person on the other line can hear me fine , but I do n't hear anything from the headset . I asked Amazon for a refund or replacement , but Al from from customer service emailed me this , `` Unfortunately , more than 30 days have passed since you received this item , and we are not able to provide a replacement . Our return policy states that within 30 days of delivery of your order , you may return any merchandise in new condition , with the original packaging and accessories , or any defective merchandise , for a full a refund or replacement. `` Fair enough.He gave me a phone number to the Jabra corporation : 619-622-0764 & lt ; -- -this number does not work . So I had to go to the Jabra website and ask them for a replacement and or refund . As of August 17 12:54am EST , I have not heard anything from the company.This could be an isolated case . And for a good brand name like Jabra , I hope it is . But it sucks when you get a faulty piece of equipment . I hope you have a better experience with this product than what I have experienced . Just do know that this product is not free from possible defects .	-1
Perhaps I just got a bad one , but this thing wo n't consistently work 4 feet away from the phone , let alone the 30 they claim . It 's a nice design , and if it worked I 'd be very happy with it.UPDATE : I just got a new BT250v after Amazon was kind enough to exchange my unit sight unseen ( they even shipped out the new unit before I 'd shipped back the bad one ) . Unfortunately , while the new unit works somewhat better , it still does n't work as well as it should . For example , there is noticeable popping ( interference ) if i put my phone in my pocket , even on the same side as the headset . I 've tried many combinations of phone and headset , and the only time I have problem is with this headset , so I 'm quite sure it 's not an issue with my phone , or with bluetooth in general . ( In fact , I 've had far better luck with other Jabra BT products . ) So , the design is beautiful and the product is great when it works , but I 've found that it fails when I really need it.FINAL UPDATE : I chucked it . Do n't believe the breathless reviews about this . If you use this in everyday life -- i.e . with the phone more than a few feet from your head -- people on the other end will hear static . I got so sick of people asking me `` what 's that clicking sound ? '' that I threw the stupid thing away . I 'm amazed people love this so much . They must be so floored by the idea of wireless technology they have n't actually tried using it for a real conversation , or they have n't actually tried to call another person . With two bad experiences with this company , that was the last Jabra product I 'll ever buy .	-1
1st month , very good . 2nd month , dropping calls and no one can seem to hear me . It was like I was not on a wireless bluetooth . It was bad having to always disconnect this because everyone on the other line could not hear or understand me . I replaced this after 2 months with the Samsung WEP and have had no problems . Not worth it .	-1
First time I bought this to pair up with my jabra a210 bluetooth adapter . Worked fine , except that the vibrate feature wo n't work . Then I exchanged it for another one . This time the vibrate works , but the call pickup button would not work . It works for power up/power down . But I ca n't pickup any incoming calls . The button simply would n't work for that functionality . I tried it with few phones and it does n't work . I already exchanged the jabra adapter once . Now I 'm sick of exchanging it . I think jabra has bad quality control . Someone in the quality control shd be fired ! Everytime you exchange something , you run into a new problem .	-1
The range on the headset was pathetic - maybe 2 or 3 feet from the phone to get a decent signal ( which defeats the entire puprpose of a CORDLESS headset IMHO ) . Otherwise , it was horrific - static , terrible sound quality , etc . Please do not waste money on that POS . I swapped it out for the Moto H850 and am much happier with that unit paired up with my MotoE815 .	-1
BT250 and this newer BT250v are pure junk . The sound quality on these two units are horrid , there are no other ways to describe it . My friends and coworkers can identify these units remotely and asked that I do not speak to them using the BT250 or BT250v . The microphone is sooooo sensitive and un-tuned , it is particularly unusable in cars or while walking . The road noise or wind noise will over saturate your voice . Even under ideal quiet surrounding , normal speech will come out muddy and weak . The battery life also shortens significantly during the 1 year warranty with moderate use . The button on this unit does n't help with usability . With the earhook design , one would push the button in the direction perpendicular into the ear to activate the button , a task easily done with one finger and no pain . However , this unit uses the behind the ear design , where you would have to use two fingers with a motion to pinch your earlobe to activate the button , it 's truly an unpleasant experience . In addition , the vibrate alert feature is just stupid and useless . In most cases , one would be wearing this unit , so the audible ringing can be heard -- why would you need it to vibrate ? ? ? I truly advise against buying this unit .	-1
One of the most worthless items I 've ever had . No troubleshooting information in the manual . Works when it wants as opposed to when I want . Charge does n't seem to last a day without any use . Whoever thought a blue flashing light on your ear was stylish should get a lobotomy.I give up on bluetooth . And mostly , nomo MotoOne star because I ca n't give it a lower vote .	-1
I returned this product because it was clearly a used headset . There were scratches on the front , and a small dent . Frankly I do not want to insert a used product into my ear . I went to Wal-mart and bought the very same product for less money .	-1
I own this headset and the sound quality is very poor . I end up having to pick up the handset manually so I can hear the person on the other end . This defeats the purpose of hands free in a car . In a quiet room it works fine . Do not buy this if you intend to use it in a car , bus or train .	-1
As a long-time Motorola bluetooth headset user , I can tell you from painful experience that there are fundamental flaws in the HS850 . In fact , I went through FOUR HS850 headsets ( under warranty ) before Motorola decided to upgrade me to the H700 ( despite the lower model number , the H700 is a newer model ) .The HS850 and H700 have the same characteristics : - Over-the-ear swing arm earpiece that can be used on left or right ear- Flip-open boom microphone that turns the headset on/off- Easy volume controls- Toggle switch to connect/disconnect calls ( or put them on hold/mute ) - Easy pairing- Good published battery life- Standard Motorola power connectorsWhat 's the difference ? Well , `` good published '' battery life is the distinction . All four of the HS850 headsets worked for a few weeks or months , but then would not hold a charge . Battery life went down to MINUTES.Dealing with Motorola support was a nightmare . Apparently , their support center for these products was in Argentina , and they could only do what was in their script to help me . After the fourth failure , I insisted on getting a support contact at their corporate HQ in Illinois . That support contact was a dream . After reviewing my case , he gave me the H700 as a replacement . I had that headset for 1.5 years , and it had kept its battery life and functionality . Of course , I lost it and had to buy a replacement ... and given all the choices , I got another H700.Do NOT fall for the lower price of the HS850 . I 've seen prices as low as $ 15 for this model . I think you 'll be frustrated and disappointed in the end .	-1
I have a Treo 650 , on Sprint PCS , with a firmware update of 1.08For the most part , I actually like this headset because it is very comfy , and people seem to hear me well ( the comfort is a big deal , as I often wear glasses ) however , this headset takes a long time to connect with the T650 -- - a good 7 to 10 seconds on most calls ( and by then , most people have hung up ) in addition , the volume is okay in the car ( or other isolated places ) but forget about using it outside or in noiser environmentsI 've heard that it works well with Moto products though -- -- for Treo 650 users , I highly recommend the Scala 500 , which has fast connection times and loud volumehappy shopping ! ! !	-1
I love not having the wire , but the microphone is so close to the earpiece that everyone I talk to with the headset is annoyed and complains about hearing themselves ( in echo ) . This problem can be diminished somewhat by turning the volume down , but then I ca n't hear the person I 'm talking to either ( unless I 'm in a perfectly silent place ) . Other than this design flaw , the headset is a nifty gadget with elegant controls , good battery life , etc .	-1
I was very dissapointed with its audio performance . I do n't want to write a lot because others have definitely written the positive features in good detail ( good microphone , quick connect , good battery life , light-weight etc . ) , but the usability is very restricted.Here is the bottom line , if you want to take this unit outside of your office/home/any quiet environment , you will NOT be able to hear the other person even if the environment is moderately noisy ( this is at unit 's highest volume ) . I was using this in the car , and I can hear faint at best when the road is good , but when you pass through slightly patchy freeway , the other person 's voice is completely drowned . The speaker 's maximum volume is just completely unacceptable . By the way , this experience was inside a luxury car , not a cardboard car . I am not sure the reason behind this design , could be to improve battery life ? I had high expectations . I am returning this unit to Amazon and will look at the Jabra BT500 ( read good reviews about it : in-ear position & USB charging ) .By the way , I used this with my Blackberry 7100g , good syncing and quick connection .	-1
Sucks ... . I want even keep this one . First it use a non usb charger and its too big and bulk this needs to put in the trashed and buried on another planet .	-1
I bought this headset to replace my HS820 . I previously used both the Motorola HS850 and the HS820 and had the same two problems with each.- Insecure attachment to my ear.- Insuffcient volumeWhenever I moved , the motorola headsets wiggled and made me feel as if they were about to fall off . They never did but it was still annoying.The volume problem was in part related to this . The contact with my ear was n't very firm and the ambient noise that the headsets let in coupled with a relatively low volume meant that I had to press the headset to my ear to hear clearly.I gave it 2 stars rather than one because of the GREAT battery life.I finally bought a Plantronics 510 and have been very satisfied .	-1
I like the look of this headset , and I really like the fact that flipping the boom turns it on and off instantly.However , the Motorola HS850 performs much worse than my much older Logitech Mobile Traveller Bluetooth Headset . Everyone I call indicates that I sound muffled , and callers typically ask me to discontinue the use of the headset . Also , the earpiece speaker is not that loud , so it is rather hard for me to hear callers when there is background noise ( e.g. , in the car ) .I just purchased this a couple of weeks ago . I am giving it to a friend and ordering a different one ( Plantronics Voyager 510 ? ) .	-1
I had this bluetooth for a week , then I started having issues . It would disconnect from my phone on its own and then stopped connecting all together . In addition , it is n't that comfortable to wear for a long period of time .	-1
Hello , Since I am the tech guy at the homestead , I am not the user but hear everything wrong about something when I get it for my wife ( sound familiar guys ? ) I bought this in spring 2012 , she used it for two months and liked it and had no complaints about it , I was her hero ! But by June it was dead-o-roonie and I was in the dog house again ! Any-hoo I was asked to purchase again . I felt the Motorola name that came along with 900+ reviews was enough to make this a good purchase never mind the price under twenty bux ? I know , I know , what do you expect for such a low price point ? Alot , something that works for a year or more and it seems so did 900+ other buyers . Well , I am onto the Motorola H730 , everyone is abuzzin ' about that one also , and I will try it for my ever lovin ' , and see if I can be her hero again for a few months or more ? I am quite sure this unit is out of warranty , but if any of you literature readers know about the warranty of this item . Post it here ? Thanks in advance .	-1
The sound is horrible ... people say I sound like I am in a muffled tunnel . And I bought two , to have in case the BT ran down ... . poor me ... .. And my Plantronics 620 works like cr*p too . No noise cancellation worth a d*mn ... forget about using it when driving a car ... . I am trying to find a new one ...	-1
Even though this ear piece is designed for a razor phone , the ear bud is too big , uncomfortable and it keeps falling off the ear . After two weeks of use , the on/off switch stopped working , and this feature was the main reason why I bought this unit . In sum , it was a waste of money . There was no provision in this review for `` 0 '' stars , so I gave it `` 1 ''	-1
I do n't see what others have liked about this . It does n't add any value -- does n't make the phone easier to carry or use , does n't add significant protection , or do anything else . I 'd recommend getting a pouch with a slide-on clip , that holds the phone horizontally on your belt or waistband .	-1
This was my first clamshell phone , and I like that aspect of the phone , but that 's about it . It seems to have worse reception than my previous phones ( all Nokia bar type ) in the same coverage areas . The biggest issue is definitely the battery . I am NOT a heavy cell phone user so I like to just leave the phone in my car or gym bag and not worry about it for a couple days . This phone will drain in 8 hours to 36 hours - with MINIMAL USAGE . I do n't know why it drains so quickly or with what seems to be random speeds , but it is extremely frustrating . Also , I am not thrilled with the intuitiveness ( or lack thereof ) of the menus , but I am sure I would have become familiar with them in time . I wo n't have a chance on this phone since I am looking to return mine ASAP.CONS : POOR Battery LifeWorse reception than previously owned phonesNot comfortable to holdPROS : Looks goodCompact	-1
Loved the idea of moving back to a palm device after my sony p900 died . Constant lockups , requiring the removal of the battery to reboot even after doing a firmware update , made me return this to amazon . Will wait for the new sony .	-1
****UPDATED on OCT. 18 , 2010*sigh*I really tried to make this work for me but it just is not worth the hassle . As previously speculated , I wonder if wearing glasses is the reason for the poor fit . I traveled quite a bit last weekend and found that , more often than not , my headset disconnected itself from my phone after a call . My hands-free-device turned into a pull-over-and-muck-with-it-after-each-call burden . Maybe I did n't have some obscure setting correct but I looked all over and could n't find one . Maybe mine was defective , I 'm not sure but it was really more trouble than it was worth . In almost ten years of ordering from Amazon I am taking advantage of the return policy for the first time.I found a different headset at 73 % off but still $ 40 ( orig $ 150 / Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth Earpiece in gold ) and it comes with its own chargeable case . Never seen a case that not only protects but also charges ! Other colors are a bit more . Check that one out if you wear glasses . It fits into the ear , not over the top , so I am hoping for a better fit . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *I was expecting more after reading the reviews.Let me first say that the sound quality is excellent . Sent myself a voice-mail while rolling the windows up and down on the freeway without an appreciable loss of sound quality ! Amazing in itself but you could barely tell the difference from `` all windows up '' and `` driver/passenger window down. '' HOWEVER ... . I wear glasses and have a rounder face . It is difficult to place the earpiece on my ear with glasses on . The bulky part does n't sit well on my glasses ' frame . The mouthpiece is not adjustable . I have fuller cheeks and the mic comes in contact with my face . Not sure why it was made that way since not all faces are the same . The control buttons are also difficult to manage while driving . The main control on the side is fine but the tiny on/off and volume buttons were hard to find and press without dislodging the unit . I turn it on before I place it on my ear . Maybe that has something to do with it sitting on my eyeglasses frame . I do like the sound quality and will continue to use it for a while before coming back to update . If it does n't work well for me I 'm sure one of my kids will like it . ( I ended up returning it . See above ) Would also recommend getting a case for it to corral the charger and unit in one place .	-1
This headset generally works , though there was times I needed to re-pair it . My problems with it that are:1 ) Its hard to turn off - if you pay attention you can turn it off easy enough , but nothing like the Motorola H700 where you just flip the boom.2 ) It 's big ! It 's comfy enough on your ear , but its huge in your pocket and since things stick out of it , its hard to get out of your pocket.3 ) Flashing blue light is way too bright ! When is dark and I 'm in the car , I keep thinking that the cops are behind me the way it blinks so brightly . It disturbed my passengers too.4 ) Wind tolerance - it 's better than my H700 , but its still too noisy to hold a conversation in any level of wind.I 'm sending mine back and getting another H700 .	-1
As many people complained , I found this headset 's microphone was very weak . The other person can not hear me at all . So I contacted Plaintronics for repair . Their repair process has no tracking , just sending in your headset to an address . Two weeks later , I received a used one back , not the one I sent in , packaged in an OEM box . Although this one has better microphone than the new one I sent in , it battery is not very reliable to hold charge , also the battery portion is kind of loose.I can not recommend Plantronics product at all .	-1
This is my second voyager 510 . The first one I had was great , but the charge was n't lasting anymore , so I ordered this as a replacement ... .very disappointed with the clarity of the unit . Lots of static in the background on my end . People on other end do n't seem to hear it , so I just deal with it .	-1
I do n't know if it 's just me , but every time I buy a blue-tooth it 's only great for a couple of months . Read the reviews and was excited but slowly performance diminished .	-1
I had Jabra when it first came out , its battery stopped charging after 10 months . So I got this one as a replacement , it too stopped charging after a year . This is the problem with all BT earpieces , its battery is not replaceable which can be done if the industry wants to . They make more money by selling the whole unit vs we pay 5-10 dollars to replace battery . This kind of practice is not sustainable . I 'm now back to the wired headset .	-1
I bought this to pair with a Sony Ericsson Walkman phone , and have been disappointed.1 ) Sound and voice quality are fine , but this thing is way too sensitive to wind . I ca n't use it outside if there is any wind current , and even the air currents from my car 's AC or heat are too much for it.2 ) Most disappointingly , the microphone boom cracked in half after about 60 days . I am working with Plantronics ' warranty department , but they need a `` date code , '' which is unreadable without a magnifying glass . I will update once I have some resolution.3 ) This device only works for the Ericsson 's phone functions , not music , because the Walkman music functions use the `` A2DP '' Bluetooth protocol , and the 510 is not A2DP compatible . ( Yes , listening to music with just one earpiece could be lame , but I would love to have podcasts on my phone ) . For A2DP , you need something like the Jabra 8010 or 8040.4 ) Contrary to some reviewers , I did n't have any problem using this with glasses . It 's a little heavy , but basically fine .	-1
This was great for the first 2 months . Month 3 , it started dropping calls . By month 4 , it was dropping more calls than it was answering . I replaced it with another bluetooth , because I could n't take it anymore . I would n't recommend this . I now have the Samsung WEP and after a few weeks , no problems as of yet .	-1
i bought this one because of the excellent review , however , after pairing it to my Treo 650 and using it for a couple of days , i 'm quite disappointed . The sound quality is ok , sound level is on the low side and some noises from time to time . i had a Samsung WEP200 too and had better quality than this one , and Samsung WEP200 is about half of the price of this . then there is the usability issue too , sometimes i hear the phone ringing , and pushed the button to accept the call and it would n't connect right away , had to wait several seconds to establish the link , the Samsung WEP200 and another Motorola ear piece i had did not have this problem .	-1
I tried two of these headsets and it was horrible for the person I was speaking to . Some heard the echo worse than the others , but all heard it . Some heard every word they said repeated back to them nearly as loud as my voice . Annoying to say the least and THANK YOU Amazon for being so amazing and taking both headsets back !	-1
If you wear glasses most of the time like I do , this headset will not be comfortable for you . In fact , I could n't keep it on without constantly adjusting it . So the sound was not good . I sent it back for a Sony over-the-head headset .	-1
I bought this because of all the positive reviews and was surprised when it was not very good but Plantronics does not support my cell phone the Treo 755P . It would have been nice to know this from the web site prior to purchasing . I love the sound quality of the Jawbone but it does not fit me-and many others.The hunt continues and Plantronics says it does not have any bluetooth headsets for the 755P ! Caveat emptor !	-1
Unfortunately , I purchased mine when it was $ 100 and have never been able to use it . I did n't return it right away because I thought I would be able to read the directions that came with it and figure out how to unmute it , but have never been able to . I can hear the other people , but they ca n't hear me . No matter what I do , it wo n't unmute . The buttons on it are very small and difficult to use when it 's in your ear . I finally got a different bluetooth that works just fine .	-1
I had a RAZR V2 and it was the best cell phone I ever had so I up graded to the RAZR V3 late last year ( 2007 ) . The RAZR V3 is by far the worst cell phone that I 've owned . It is beautiful and has great features but it keeps failing I have had 5 of these phones so far ( the original purchased one plus 4 refurbished replacements ) 1st phone : after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 2nd phone would not charge from the get go / 3rd phone after about a month the screen would no longer light up / 4th phone after a couple of months the screen would not light up / 5th phone has been working for about a month now . I really like the RAZR phones , WHEN THEY WORK but this V3 model has been terrible and I would rate it lower than 1 star if possible .	-1
I purchased three of them in 2 weeks . The phone is great , but they all have the same problem : the battery does n't stay firm in its place and the phone turns off every 5 minutes .	-1
Searched for `` droid 3 chargers '' when making my purchase . This was the first product to pop up , had decent reviews , and was cheap . I purchased 3 . The product arrived on time . HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones . I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times . No results in replacement , return or refund . Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice . Very offensive and unprofessional . Needles to say , I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones . Anyone wan na trade ?	-1
This charger worked fine for a while but now it has a bad connection somewhere inside . I have to jiggle the body of it around until a good connection is produced . The problem is not the wall outlet -- this happens in any outlet in any building .	-1
This was not what I was looking for , therefore I sent it back . It did not work with my Droid Razr Maxx .	-1
yea they sound great , the bluetooth signal is awesome crystal clear with no hiss or pop or fading in an out . The bad part is the headband breaks for no reason other than just using it . Now I got a $ 50 piece of junk that I ca n't use	-1
As other people have said , the headphones are a bit too heavy on the ears . After 3 weeks the crack in the headband started , after 2 months the crack is so big the headphones stopped working . I will try returning them for a replacement but I do n't see why , as the design just is n't very smart with the headband cracking in the only place that is under stress . They should have reinforced that one spot.It 's a shame as the sound was really top notch and I used to be able to connect them to my ipod and leave it in my bag , or connect to my PC via 'bluetooth advanced audio ' and not disturb my wife while I 'm killing zombies in Half-Life 2 .	-1
his and the white version of wireless headphone for ipod is being clearanced elsewhere for a good reason . I got one and it really cracks just by being flexed often enough , which is really unavoidable no matter how careful you are . It is only a matter of time . Mine cracked within a week , and yes I knew about the problem beforehand and was very careful . Unless you have a really small head ( maybe the size of a softball ) , do n't mind a cracked band or enjoy going through customer service , do n't get it . it looks and sounds good otherwise , and works with computer bluetooth adaptors provided that you have software driver support for high quality bluetooth audio ( a2dp ) . it 's a pity .	-1
but no data , thick and stiff cable , you get what you pay for , keep looking for better cable reviews and pass on this	-1
I must have called Verizon ten times in four months , nagging them to offer the Treo 650 on their network . I almost deserted them to get the phone , but in mid-June , I finally got my Verizon branded Treo 650 . It has not been a great experience.First the positives . It is very cool to have all my contacts , all my appointments and todo items on my phone . While the phone is large by today 's cell phone standards , it is a great looking unit and functions well . It is easy to set up email and web access and it is great to be able to stay in touch with the normal too-much-email office when I am traveling.However , it is not all great news . First , I have had a heck of a time keeping the unit synchronized with my office Outlook . I get duplicates by the tons and , worse , deleted contacts . The dupes are somewhat tolerable to deal with , but losing contacts , which slip into my deleted Outlook folder is not acceptable . No one has been able to tell my why this is happening.Second , the reception and volume of the phone are horrible . Where my old Motorola TC30 could get calls in awful reception areas , the Treo is spotty inside my own house . I lose calls in transit and while sitting still . Worse , the volume is very faint . I purchased a software tweak called VolumeCare which slightly amplifies the wimpy sound from the phone , but distorts it as well . About the only acceptable solution is to use a headset and plant that sound right in your ear ! Not a convenient or very affordable solution.All-in-all , I 'm disappointed in the Treo . It has some nice features , but it is very disappointing as a phone .	-1
Crap do not buy will not work with any of the phones I have paid under four dollars . I just trashed it	-1
It 's okay , I think this is gon na fall under the category of & # 34 ; you get what you pay for & # 34 ; . Only had to use it for a day or two because that cellphone broke .	-1
this ear pec is not so good its like a prop from a old movie you no syfy star trak .	-1
Just received it today from A1 Accessories . I bought it solely to use on xbox live so I would n't have to keep moving my other headset that I use for work ( I work at home ) . My friends kept asking me to repeat myself . One said that he had to turn down his tv volume so he could hear me ( no lie ) . I switched back to the other headset and I was back to crystal clarity . After that , I threw this one in the trash.. Good thing it only cost me $ 5 or so .	-1
Plug this in . Sometimes it connects ; sometimes it doesn't.I hear callers just fine , but they ask if I am in the bathroom when I wear this.If I leave it plugged into the earphone jack of my phone , it somehow manages to turn my phone off after a few minutes of non-use.I would send it back , but my total cost was only $ 3.My phone is an older Motorola v365 , and I 'm sticking with to my BluetoothPlantronics 510 [ Retail Packaging ] . Maybe this can be an emergency backup .	-1
I gave up and threw mine away when it would not work correctly on any device . Ear phones on one , Mic on another . Poor Quality . I expected better from Jabra !	-1
I thought that I was buying the right one and it ends up that I did but not the right size plug for the phone .	-1
It will vary by individual but it did n't fit my ear . It was also in a small plastic bag so who knows where it came from . What do you expect for the price which I ca n't complain about .	-1
This model , the C250 EarWave Boom , is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered . I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used , however , all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality . With each one , the persons on the other end could not hear me . Disappointed . I ended up getting the Ge Tl26593 Earset Microphone by Jasco , which has been the best so far .	-1
Bottom line : ca n't use because the volume of my voice is too low for people to easily hear . Bought off of ebay after my c200 cord was cut . The c200 worked well , but this c250 with the longer `` boom '' mic extension was not as loud . Jabra headsets are very comfortable and easy to wear all day . Reasonably easy to put on with one hand once you get the hang of it . I am not sure if my problem was unusual , but these corded headsets seem to be hit or miss . I have had other brands where the sound quality is not very good or too low.I will just reorder another c200 and take my chances with that .	-1
My wife and I both purchased the BT350 on suggestion from a Verizon rep with our new phones . She got a Treo650 and I got the LG8100.Pairing the device was relatively easy , once you followed the written instructions . However , we 've both had problems with the headset staying paired with our phones on a couple of occassions , and have to run the pair-up process again.When they work , the sound is pretty good . But most of the time , they do n't work very well at all . And for the record , typicall my headset is with 3-4 feet of my phone - and I 've had the same problems when it 's less than 2 feet away with perfect line of sight.My wife and I almost never can call each other using our headsets and connect on the first try . Oh , it will call and we 'll try to answer , and it will sound loud and usually clear - but one of us ca n't hear the other 99 % of the time - at all . It 's a series of `` hello-hello ? HELLO ? '' Forcing us to hangup and call again . Then we usually are connected.When we do connect , the sound typically has some static , minor digital echoing , and/or frequent dropouts such that you ca n't hear what the other party is saying . It 's very annoying - almost like when you try to fake that your getting bad reception on your cell phone an ... it ... sou ... ds..li..is.The one button feature is ok once you figure out what the various presses on it do . I 've never had to adjust the volume buttons , but they are basically up and down.More annoying is the continuously strobing blue LED on the main button . When the headset is powered on , the button flashes . When you are actually using the headset ( connected to a call ) the button flashes faster . This confuses people when you are wearing it - because it appears to them that you must be using it since it 's flashing . But it 's always flashing ! So if you are a person who uses it a lot and does n't take it off very often , that can cause a problem.Even MORE of a problem is driving with it at night . For a week , I drove home in the dark with my headset , and found myself constantly turning my head to look for emergency vehicles as I kept seeing this blue strobe out of the corner of my eye . But of course when I turned my head , it was gone . I finally figured out it was the reflection of my headsets indicator light reflecting off the windows ! That ca n't be good.On the plus side - it is very lightweight and easy to wear on either ear . It comes with an AC and a USB charger - which was great since I could charge it at work or with my laptop . It seems to hold a charge very well for long periods . I know I 've gone an entire week without recharging . The range seem pretty good - though I usually never get beyond a few feet from my phone.Even though I ca n't take this headset back , I 'm purchasing another one because this one is pretty much useless if the intent of it 's design is to have a simple to operate , hands-free and safe method of communicating with your cell phone . The BT350 simply does n't meet any of those standards .	-1
( updated ) + Good battery life+ Very comfortable ( choice of two ear bud tips , plus extras ) + Easy to use+ Minimal bling appeal ( blue light is not obtrusive ) - First unit failed ( charger , headset buggy ) after only 3 weeks use- Jabra Support is lackluster- Ugly shiny mic piece ( photo on Amazon is not accurate , see customer images ) After three weeks of use , it stopped charging from the AC adapter . It dropped audio connections while dialing , or after 20 minutes of conversation . ( Replacement unit has also exhibited this , but less . ) Contacted Jabra about the charging issue , they required that I a ) return the headset under an RMA , and THEN they will b ) send me a new one . After less than a month of use . I found another way to get a replacement ( boomerang purchase at a local chain 'tronics store . ) On the plus side , it lasts on standby for a few days ( vice a few hours like my Sony BT headset does ) . It fits around my ear , and comfortably in my ear , very easily . The loop is soft rubber , so no sharp or rigid plastic is clamping on your outer ear . If the sound is not quite loud enough ( the volume controls are easy to find by touch , but this in-ear speaker can only blast so much ) , the earbud can be gently pressed in to form a seal , and is easier to hear this way . Sound is so-so , some callers have told me they ca n't hear me if there 's ambient sound , music , wind , or cars nearby . In all , better than average , but this is the second Jabra product that 's crapped out on me , so be wary . ( I recommend always owning a wired headset as a backup , and particularly for business or important personal use . ) ** JULY 2008 UPDATE **I 've now used this for 2 years and can give it a much better review . The unit has held up well ( though the tip broke and had to be glued back ) . It still holds several hours charge , where my old Sony headset now lasts one 10 minute conversation and dies . The shape , weight , and ergonomic fit are so unobtrusive that I 've had some companions remind me I 'm still wearing it after hanging up on a call . Although I did n't like the shiny `` bling '' microphone tip , I 've now softened on this design . The BT500 is still more attractive and less attention getting than others . Because I have a headset at work , and my new car has a HandsFreeLink feature , I use this unit at home , and after two years , it still works great . I recommend this headset without reservation . ( Disclosure : I use this with a Nokia 6682 , and have not tested it with other phone models . )	-1
This earpiece was a great idea , but the main issue with it is that it has no noise reduction , and that it begins to crackle too easily when my arm or body part gets in between it and the phone . Some may say that 's normal , but NO -- there are plenty Motorolas and Sony-Erricsons that have stronger connectivity that do n't crackle as easy when obstructed , so do n't buy into that line .	-1
I used it for less than a week and charged it 3 times . On the fourth try the green light disappeared and it would n't turn on.I bought this because i loved the Jabra 250 and I still use it , as a matter of fact.I was just really disappointed that something like this ( for the price I paid for it ) would just stop working for no good reason.I should 've bought the plantronics.Do n't waste your money on this .	-1
I bought it expecting it to be much better than the one I 've had for almost two years now . Big disappointment . The static I used to get from the bt250 has not gone away especially when I have my phone in my left pocket of my pants and the headset on my right ear . Also , people tell me my voice sounds remote like I am in a room.This is not acceptable . I am going back to BestBuy to return it . Why pay $ 120 if there 's no added value ? ! No doubt , it wraps around your ear very snug unlike the Motorola headsets but there 's virtually no improvements compared to BT250.And let me guess - the next Jabra model would be BT500v for vibrate . I can tell you now - I ai n't buying that one either.I guess it 'll be a while before someone comes up with a headset that 's not static-y but I 'm willing to wait.Roumen .	-1
I hate this phone ... I was drawn to it by it 's appearance and size but what a horrible dissapointment . I had to get motorola mobile tools and 'hack ' the volume so I could hear it - the loudest default setting is just too low . The display is impossible to see outside in bright light , I detest it that it has such a poor means of displaying missed calls , if the same caller has attempted to reach you multiple times , it displays the last call time only . I just returned this phone for a replacement because of dust under the display screen , I was told that it is a 'known ' issue , but that my replacement phones warranty will expire this month at the same time as the original that I purchased .	-1
The Hype says : '' Getting on the Internet is easy with the RAZR V3 as it supports Cingular 's GSM-based Wireless Internet Express service . When used with a Cingular data plan and the phone 's Bluetooth or USB data capability , the phone can be used as a wireless modem for laptops and PDAs . `` I say : CACA ! If you plan on connecting to the internet using this phone and bluetooth you had better get a mongo battery for your laptop because it 's the slowest , laggiest , painfully irritating , useless piece of doggy doo that I have ever had the displeasure of using ! You could run to Seattle and knock on Amazon 's front door faster than connecting to the site.Update : 6/7/2006I tested the actual bandwidth and I connect at 39.1 kbps , that 's slower than dialup with a 56k ( 53.3 ) modem . When connected to Cingular 's GSM it says connected at 115.2 kbps when I connect via bluetooth and 230 kbps when I use the USB cable . Either way the actual speed is 39-41 kbps and I surely do n't have the patience for that.One last annoying feature ... Cingular `` brands '' their phones so you ca n't download games to your phone or delete certain ringtones etc. , as you can with other providers . There is also an annoying `` HELLOMOTO '' video/commercial that uses 25 % of your available space for videos of your own . There is no way to delete this and recapture this waste of space . This truly is about the worst product I have ever purchased .	-1
Like the previous Motorola phones that I 've had , this one has the easy intutive system for navigating its numerous menus -- - I 'm sold on using Motorola for this reason , compared to the Noxxxx , Motorola is great ! PROS : Almost everythingAwesome designGSMI found the volume to be excellent compared to my last phone ( motorola v60 ) .Good antenna , extremely low rate of dropped signals -- - also , since the antenna does not protrude , I anticipate it will not require replacement ( I had to replace the antenna twice on my old v60 -- - broke off from carrying in pocket and/or dropping ) Excellent color screen.Good camera for a phone.Great size , easily fits in a shirt pocket.Great battery life ( with Bluetooth off ) Easily customizable but items that I never use ( media mall , media net , etc . ) remain in a prominent place and can not be put in some obscure location.CONS : The most significant negative feature is the screen -- - it is extremely hard to see in sunlight.Display on front ( when closed ) is hard to read.Price ( if you are upgrading your phone with Cingular -- - they wanted $ 199 ) However , since I was changing from AT & T ; to Cingular I was able to buy the phone at BestBuy for $ 70.The manual that comes with it should be better writen.Screen gets oily from normal use and must be wiped off frequently.Alarm Clock interface could be better.Date Book Alert is not very loud.Accessory support at Cingular Stores rather poor -- - two Cingular Stores did not have the USB cable ( had to buy one at Wal-Mart ) .Of the four or five phones that I have owned , this one is by far the best in all respects . Even with these cons it is still eons ahead of other phones.EDIT : Change from 5 stars to 1 star ... I loved the features on the phone and the flip lid was great . PROBLEM : After about 3 months the screen would not light up -- - took the phone back to AT & T ; and they sent me a reconditioned phone which lasted about a month -- - took that one back , they sent another reconditioned phone , Long story > short : I had 5 phones in one year , the 5th phone finally worked and kept working for a couple of years . Because of my experience with this phone , I will not buy another Motorola .	-1
10 years into the cell phone revolution the phones have gotten smaller , lighter with great features but what 's the point when you ca n't carry on a conversation ? I have found Cingular to be by far the worst in terms of dropped calls in the SF Bay Area . I suffered thru AT & T and their conversion to GSM and Cingular is not any better than that service no matter what they promise . Cingular also has very consumer unfriendly 2 yr. contracts that you will be paying on long after that shiny phone has lost its lustre . They are constantly changing their rollover minute plans to screw you out of your minutes . When i downgraded from a higher national plan to a lower national plan they took away all the minutes I aquired in a year . In other words maximize the revenue - minimize the service is their motto . I could live with this if i could make a decent phone call - i ca n't believe there are so many dead areas in a place with 13 million people .	-1
The Motorola RAZR V3 is worst cell phone I have ever had . The only nice feature is the camera and there are a lot of other cell phones with better features that have cameras too . Also beware of the so-called rebate . If you do n't mind jumping through 50 million hoops to get it , well go for it but if your time is money , run from this rebate and this phone . 5 co-workers in my office thought we would take advantage of this offer and what we thought would be a cool , hip cell phone . How wrong we all were . Cingular is fine . They have their issues like all the cell companies now for customer service but it is the phone itself & the rebate program that was an issue for ALL 6 of us . 3 people had problems with the buttons on the phone and had to send them back before they even got their rebates . The acutual rebate thats up to 4 months to receive and that is only if you have correctly jumped through all of the hoops . One mistake and you are screwed out of the $ 150 rebate.Another problem with the phone and it 's limited features is that other than the initial tone that you have a message there is no way to know that you have a message waiting unless you pick up the phone and look . All my older model cell phones featured a tone and/or a light on the outside of the phone to let you know that you had a message.I have never written a review before on Amazon or otherwise , but I feel that people should be aware that the cool , hip advertising of the RAZR is not what it is cracked up to be .	-1
This cable is ultra thin and must not be shielded well . If I ca n't find the perfect spot to put my Ipod within the 2 foot circumference of the cable - then I get a ton of interference . Even when I can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally . I have another cable ( non-retractable ) that is only a foot long that works just fine - so I know the interference has something to do with this cable .	-1
UPDATE : this silly 3.5mm cord lasted all of 3 months audio went out and the retractor went out very cheap quality would not buy this again went with the old standard non retractable cord	-1
I picked up one of these specifically for its ability to retract ; it 's quite fragile and flimsy , though , and within two days , it had broken and no longer retracts . It 's fine as a cable so far , but now it has a heavy middle , which means if I drop it easily as I 'm trying to plug it in , and have to go hunting for it between the seats .	-1
First of all , when I ordered this item the image showed it was WHITE not black . I ordered this specifically to match my white iPhone . Not only that the thing fell apart as I was taking it out of the box . I will be returning this garbage and getting my $ 5.00 back . Last time I ever purchase a Scosche product !	-1
This worked for about a week before it stopped staying put when you pulled both ends out . It kept retracting ad then finally just broke . Its a great idea , but this one sucks !	-1
I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and did n't use it at all . It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels . It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts . If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently . Note that I did n't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use . I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use , this is the cable you want to get . It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot . Just wish it would have lasted longer .	-1
Seller lost this package at their facility and it took 2 months to receive it . I bought it as a gift and i 'm glad it took too long to get here . it 's flimsy and gets really tangled really easy . avoid at all costs .	-1
I decided to return this product the moment I took it out of the box . It 's cheaply made . My decision was cemented when it stopped working after one day of use .	-1
It lasted me 2 days then it didnt charge I thought it was my battery but no it was the charger	-1
I 'm really unimpressed with this headset . Granted , its a pretty old design now ( i bought it in 2006 ) and I imagine there are much better headsets out there.There is way too much static for such a simple , digital device . It is especially bad if I have my phone in the opposite-side pocket as which ear I have the headset in.Certainly you can do better than this by now . Get something with a later bluetooth version .	-1
I bought the Plantronics 320 today . As soon as I walked out the store , the reception went static beyond belief . The salesman said `` Give it a chance '' , I have and it 's going back tomorrow . For the past week I 've bought 4 headsets ( Motorola 500,850,700 , & this one which is one of the worst.I found the Motorola 700 to be the best so far . Clear reception most of the time , excellent volume ( no problem hearing while driving ) , & it always connected to my treo 650 . On a windy day my friend on the other end did n't even know I got out the car , hardly any background noise . I just ordered the 700 through Amazon , much cheaper than Cingular & Motorola .	-1
I really wanted this headset to work out because it is being sold at such a good price relative to most others . Well , it prooved to me that you often get what you pay for . Let 's consider the following in why I am returning this headset : pairing , sound quality , ease of use , and comfort.Pairing - this really belongs with ease of use , but it is really your first experience with a headset other than charging it . It was hard to figure out if I was holding the multifunction button down long enough to get the headset in paring mode . After 4 attempts , I got it right . My LG VX-9800 ( see my review ) was able to pair with it easily after this . However , it should n't take 4 attempts just to get a headset into pairing mode.Sound Quality - this is actually the area where the headset does the best in my opinion . With the speaker resting inside my ear , I did n't have to have the volume turned all the way up in order to hear the people I called . My wife reported that she could hear me clearly with one exception . When I had the AC fan speed in my car set to 3 ( out of 4 ) , she said that it sounded like I was in a wind tunnel . Kicking the AC down to 2 fixed the problem , but once we hit the Texas summer that could be a problem.Ease of Use - I think that Plantronics ' attempt to make this headset easy to use backfired . I would go to turn on the headset , but I would always have to check my phone to see if it was connected . Initiating voice commands also required multiple attempts before I would hear the familiar `` Please say a command '' from my phone . However , what really drove me nuts was trying to turn it off . I would hold down the multifunction button for what I thought was the amount of time specified in the instructions , but I kept getting `` Please say a command '' . Compare this to the Motorola HS850 ( see my review ) where on/off is controlled by the folding boom while the multifunction button simply handles pairing , voice commands , and call connecting . I consider my self to have technology savvy and able to fight through things to make them work , but this headset *still* frustrated me . If you like things to work simply , this headset is n't for you.Comfort - I was willing to put up with the flaky operation of the headset because of the cost ; however , I realized after two days that I was not going to be able to stand to wear it for any extended period of time . The speaker pipes its volume into a rather hard earpiece that fits inside your ear . It is not removable , and try as I might to adjust it , I could not find a comfortable position . The ear hook is also fairly rigid . These two things combined made for an unpleasant comfort experience.I have to consider this headset to be a failure . On the box , it touts `` Comfort '' and `` Ease of Use '' . As you can see from my results , it does n't deliver on either of these . It 's a shame because it does deliver good sound quality at a reasonable price . Unless you have the ear it was modeled after , though , I would not buy it .	-1
If this unit looks big in the photo , brace yourself : it 's like a bad science fiction rocket ship when it arrives . It is made of hard plastic with odd fins and protrusions everywhere . It does not rest easily on the head . It feels heavy and abrasive . I am surprised that none of these manufacturers have come up with a softer , lighter material , or spent any time considering how to fit a headset to the ears and head . Sony does a better job with its DRBT21G/B , but also falls victim to hard plastic and a hinge in the middle of the set that digs at your skull as time goes on . Truly astonishing.I could not get the unit to pair with my top-of-the-line Sony bluetooth transmitter . Motorola was `` kind '' enough to issue a stern warning about returning this item without calling their toll-free number . What a waste of time . They either do n't answer the hone , or leave you hanging for long periods of time on hold .	-1
I just got this from Amazon . I have a Treo700wx ( sprint ) and set up was a breeze and comfort of earpiece is excellent . However , I keep losing the connection between the 640 Headset and Treo . The Headset beeps in my ear everytime the connection is lost and it happens often . I double checked the connection and everything is set up per the instructions . Just wondering if I have a defective unit or if there is anyone else experiencing the same problems .	-1
Fits my Galaxy Note 3 but just does n't want to stay on the window ... keeps falling off . Not much good if it keeps falling off .	-1
This would be great product if it lived up to its specs.Pros:1.comfortable2.ease of use3.fantastic sound quality on both ends.Cons:1 . Battery does n't hold a charge2 . 12V adapter seems to `` cook '' the battery.3 . has a habit of dropping connection ( I think this common to all BT devices ) I 'm currently on my second `` Road Warrior '' headset . The first one became extremely hot when charged with the 12V adapter plug & would n't hold a charge for over a few hours. , I suspect that the truck voltage ( 14.1V ) is too much for this little battery . I have n't tried the auxiliary truck plug on this one as I do n't want to fry the battery . The AC power brick has a rated output of 9V so I suspect the 5V difference is what does in the battery . This one I have only used the AC adapter & the battery life is at best abysmal . The info supplied claims a standby life of up to 100 hours & talk time of up to 6 hours . Not even close . Yesterday my unit ran 6 hours standby & 1 hour talk before it had to be recharged . If this unit lived up to it hype I would give it 5 stars , but with its poor battery life I only give it 2 . If you can live with the battery issues its a great unit .	-1
Well , I have no idea what these sound like . They wont work on my phone ! The connector is made ONLY for a Ericsson phone , which was NOT stated anywhere on the description . They were however cheap , so I really cant complain too much .	-1
I 'm on my third z520a in the six months I 've owned it . The only reason I have n't gone through more is that I 've accepted this phone is a lemon . The phone freezes and ca n't be shut off , requiring removal of the battery to reset , frequently drops calls , does n't always let me place calls , and just plain does weird things that result in an unreliable and frustrating call experience . What is even more annoying is that I purchased expensive , model-specific accessories that will become useless paperweights when I replace this with a new phone - a phone I will be out additional hundreds on , not to mention the cost of accessories . I 'll never buy another Sony Ericsson product .	-1
The design is good and it would be an excellent product if the quality was anything more than terrible . The buttons to extend the arms worked exactly one time before breaking . Now I press and press and nothing happens . It 's a shame because the rest of it works decently.The suction cup holds well and the tube coming from the cup is pretty sturdy . It moves a lot when the car is moving so you would need to rest it on the dash which would help somewhat but not perfectly.Overall one star only because with the poor quality it is worthless in spite of the few good points .	-1
The Goose neck is too hard to bend to shape and it does n't stay put on the windshield very well either . I donated it to a local thrift store because it would have cost more to ship it back than the refund was worth .	-1
Great idea and design , not great execution and materials.It works good , but once mounted , almost impossible to adjust-out the sides with the ratcheting mechanism . You sort of have to tilt it backwards to make the ratchet action work . When mounted , you ca n't tilt it , so it 's a real hassle to open.I have mine set , and I just wedge the phone into it when I want to use it.I primarily use it when driving through New York city , to use my phone as a dash-cam . Eventually I 'd like to get video of the people that walk into my car or cyclists that ride into it ... It 's great for that.It 's obvious the plastic or construction material allows it to fall out of tolerance , which means the ratchet action ceases to function . It 's a crapshoot when you build a complex mechanism out of parts that break or wear easy , or are n't built to spec in the first place .	-1
It even seemed flimsy at first and got stuck while we were trying to figure out how it worked . We did get it unstuck and we thought the problem was solved , but we were wrong.After using it for only a couple days it completely stuck and is no longer functional . Pretty upset as my husband really wanted this for his work vehicle and now we have to go searching for another one and hopefully do n't run into the same problem .	-1
I only purchased this phone because Cingular did not carry the new RAZR with the MP3 player and 1.3 megapizel camera so I had to settle for this one . The swivel to use the keypad is awful , no one can ever hear me when talking , ( even when I use the Motorola H700 Bluetooth headset ) , photos taken on a regular megapixel camera phone are better than the 1.3 provided here , ca n't listen to MP3 thru bluetooth , photos stored on phone often become corrupted for no reason at all , all photos disappear occassionally and I have to turn phone off and back on , too bulky and heavy , battery at times drains after only an hour even without any use , reception very poor and often have to stand in wide open areas . Overall , I am very disappointed with this phone and only wish my contract would allow me to trade it in . I am a gadget junkie and the reviews on CNET led me to purchase this phone but I truly now regret it . Go with the new Motorola RAZR with the 1.3 camera and the MP3 player , same features in a nice slim package .	-1
Everything works fine , but it can only sustain less than two days for very lightweight use ( most of the time in standby status ) I ordered two sony ericsson w600i from wirefly , they are bundled with cingular family share plan . Both phone are locked to cingular.Talked with sony ericsson support service , sony doubted it may be the problem of battery or phone and both of them.Talked with wirefly , they decided to exchange .	-1
Case was garbage . What I got was not whats pictured . Also nothing lined up . Sent back promply . Would not purchase again .	-1
Watch out people -- the notched circular connection on these ear cushions does not fit the opening on a Plantronic Voyager Pro -- the diameter is too small , and they fall out . However I ordered the `` medium gel eartips '' , Plantronics Medium Eartips for Voyager Pro [ 3 Pack ] pack of 3 , and the connector on those does fit . So I 'm keeping the gel eartips ( not this item ) and throwing out these foam ones .	-1
It lasted for less than a year and I always had trouble hearing people . It never sat well on my ear , no matter how I adjusted it . Luckily , it was less than $ 20 , so no big loss . I was disappointed because I expected better from Motorola . The volume control was awful . It never seemed to make much of a difference . I would n't recommend it at all .	-1
I bought this for my wife for christmas and i am disapointed in the voice quality . When she is in the car talking to me on it I can barely hear her because of the car noise and even with her having the radio on low it is still annoying to hear everything in the background . For the almost $ 50 price tag i thought it would be better quality since it was the step up from the entry level bluetooth . I also havent found how to put it on the left ear yet , i feel like i am going to break it if i try to pull the ear loop off.I would recommend spending another $ 40 and buying the Jawbone bluetooth . I got one as a present and it works great and fits better on my ear . I drastically reduces background noise.Overall , I am not impressed by motorola and thought they would make a better bluetooth for this price .	-1
This item did not fit easily on the ear . Earbud not designed properly . I would not recommend this product . Also too bulky .	-1
I have no idea what they mean by `` Motorola Retail Packaging '' , but beware it is not the same as the picture on the website . I received this headset loose in a plastic bag , along with the instructions and the charger . The charger had been ripped out of it 's bag and used ( the cord had obviously been re-wrapped and secured with a grocery store bag tie ) .When I complained to Amazon about receiving used merchandise , they immediately sent a replacement via overnight , but the customer service person could have cared a less as to why Amazon is selling used/returned merchandise.I just received the replacement today . While it does n't look used , it too is just in a plastic baggie - no packaging like the webite shows . I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife ( to go with her pink Razr ) - I 'm sure she is going to be very impressed with the plastic baggie packaging . I sure hope it works better than it looks ! Really bad , Amazon , really bad .	-1
I ordered the H700 after reading a number of good reviews . I got it from Circuit City , so it 's not a 'counterfeit ' . It pairs well with my Moto Q9C , and it is very comfortable- but thats the end of the good things I can say about it . The volume is too low for me to hear callers if there is any ambient noise , and the static which happens sporadically *usually when I 'm on an important call makes this virtually unusable . I guess I will RMA and see if this one is a dud and the replacment is any better .	-1
I threw it out because of terrible Volume/clarity on both ends . Go for the Scala 500- I just bought my second ( lost my first ) and it 's the best on the market .	-1
The H700 , some love it , some hate it . Wherever you fall , a lot of people are talking about it.PRO 's / CON'sIt is comfortable and light . / Depending on the size of your face , your cheek may block the microphone resulting in muffled sound.If you are a lady with long hair that falls over your ear it will get caught in the boom microphone and snagged by the rubber tip as you flip the boom open and closed to answer calls.Distance is quoted as up to 30 feet / Some phone combinations have distance issues if the headset and phone are not on the same side of your body.Pairs well with my Motorola Razr V3 and Cingular 8125 . / Other phones and PDA 's have problems SO your mileage may vary.The controls are small , multifunction ( each button does may things ) and are easy to access but hey , they are on the side of your head.Microphone is Very sensitive / People have complained about wind noise , echoes in rooms , and `` Who else is in the car with you ? `` Headset volume is loud , louder than most / Its adjustable so this is a good thing.The headset lights up in four different colors to show various status ( charging , pairing , standby etc ) / You can turn off the flashing blue 'I am using a fancy headset dork lamp ' but it will come back on after the headset is turned off and on again.A note a caution1 . This is a young product and the complaints and returns have resulted in two versions ( Version A and Version B ) of this headset in the market . Version B fixes a number of problems that version A had with certain phones.2 . Distance is POOR compare to other headsets and even other Motorola Bluetooth products . I have changed my headset and Cingular has replaced the phones ( Razr V3 and 8125 ) twice with no improvement . Distance is less than 10 feet with Static and dropped calls . Do not expect to leave your phone in the car and pump gas or get the mail without complaints . Some folks with the Verizon V3C Razr have reported getting better distance but few past 10 feet without the call degrading or dropping.SUPPORT3 . Motorola gives you 30 days to try and return with refund , However the return shipping is ON YOU . So with shipping / tracking / insurance expect to spend another $ 5 even if its their problem . If its longer than 30 days , you are stuck with it.UPDATE 6/1/06Product was returned as defective and received by Motorola 6/15 . A new one was to go out 2 day FedEx . 22 Days later I received it today 7/7 , NOT NEW , just a refurbished headset . NO charger , manual , case , or warranty card.UPDATE 11/18/06Died again . Will not pair , make , or answer a call . Motorola will not send a replacement until old one is received . No free-shipping this time.BOTTOM LINEGoogle `` Motorola H700 problems '' , make an informed decision . If you can , try before you buy.I would give it 5 stars for Style , 3 stars for execution , 2 stars for how well it works , and 1 star for their support policy .	-1
I had the 850 and thought that it was decent but could be better so I bought the 700 . Let me just say that I own the Motorola V330 and from reading the other reviews , it seems that this headset works best with the razr . That being said , it does not work well with the v330 . If you move more than 4 feet away from your phone , you get a ton of static . People tell me that I sound muffled when I 'm talking to them . My advice is to only get this if you have the razr otherwise forget it .	-1
It 's did n't work for me r my phone its as a lot of mess on it I think this seller should n't have any more item on the best website I think	-1
This is a replacement for a prior Motorola bluetooth headset of very similar design . I was quite pleased with the old one , until after about 2 years when it just died . That was 2 years of daily service , so not an issue . But this new one has issues holding pairing with a Blackberry 8700G , and has significant voice static unless the Blackberry is on the same side of my body as the headset , and not in the holster . The old one did n't have that problem.On the positive side , the USB mini charger saves me one more power adaptor when traveling , which is a good thing . They should all have that feature .	-1
It got a lot of static noise . The connection was not good either . You have to put your phone within 6 inches away from the ear piece to get better reception . Regret for buying it . One useless item and money go down the drain .	-1
I love the size , form factor , and usability of this headset . Incoming sound is good . Unfortunately , the outgoing sound is a deal breaker . If there is any background noise , this headset will pick it up and transmit it just as loud as your voice . The DSP helps a little , but affects the sound quality dramatically ( think overcompressed MP3 ) . I am an attorney and need to talk to clients ; I need to sound professional . Unfortunately , this $ 100 headset does not match the sound quality of a $ 25 wired headset with a boom mic . I am trying to modify mine by rewiring it with a boom mic from an [ ... ] headset , but so far I have not gotten it to work . I am willing , though , to risk destroying the JX10 in order to have a chance at better outgoing sound .	-1
I can hear people on it fine but have had nothing but complaints from friends . I ca n't use it .	-1
Reviews on this product were very good but there was one piece that would have likely broke easily per reviews and for this price point I decided to return it .	-1
Does n't work , phone keep showing invalid battery . Wasted my money ! Thought about returning it , but it 's cheap , so I just do n't bother .	-1
after wearing for a few mintues , i got blister and swelling ears . it has no insulator . it hurt the back of the ears so bad and that when i notice i have blister . i don '' t know why motorolla called themselve engineer . you don '' t need a rocket scientist to have some kind of pads or insulator to protect your skin	-1
I got a defective purchase item here and am still awaiting the RMA from the seller . Not really a comfortable product to wear . Ca n't comment on the product as it has never worked to date . But I can say this was a bad buy in that the rig is not very comfortable to wear . I can say look to other products to meet your needs .	-1
I upgraded from a Nokia 6600 ( which I loved but it was n't the hottest looking phone ) and have also had the Motorola A630 . This phone is nice , dainty , and has a great display , but it ends there : * ) The speaker is n't loud enough , so you 're always pressing the phone to your ear so incredibly hard and still ca n't hear too well - I called T-Mobile , they acknowledged the problem and sent instructions to the phone to increase the speaker volume to no avail . * ) The slider is hard to get to quickly - if you try sliding the phone open , many times you will actually reject a call . * ) Using call waiting is n't too bad - when you go to call waiting it is easy , but retrieving a call is painful* ) Text messages - this is the worst ever - first , slide the phone open , create a message , hit the enter key , then recent log , then select your recipients , then next then enter then the message sends . On the nokia it was create the message , hit the green button , enter your destination , hit the green button . * ) deleting messages is worse ! select the message , hit options , hit delete ( sometimes it 's 4 , sometimes 6 ) , `` are you sure '' , hit yes , done . On the nokia , select the message and hit `` c '' and you were instantly done . * ) bluetooth - it 's supposed to be convenient , but NO , you are always asked if you want to connect - there is no such thing as auto-connect ! every time I get in my car I have to get the phone out of my pocket and unlock the phone , then hit yes , or I 'll be nagged every few seconds by a noise . Oh , and if I hit NO ( when someone else is in the car and I do n't want calls going to the car ) it 'll ask me again in about 5 seconds . ARRRGH ! This baby is going back ! I 'm now gon na try out the Blackberry 8700 .	-1
July 2007 : Great form factor , mediocre features , weak Mac supportForm : As an exclusive candybar user ( Nokia & Sony-Ericsson , both high end and mid range ) I was trepidatious of using a slider . In lieu of a decent , nonflip , bluetooth/camera phone w/ Tmobile I went with this phone . Friends and strangers alike say : ooh how pretty . I say ... Pros:1 . 1.3 Mp camera2 . Bluetooth3 . most vivid clear screen I 've seen on a cell4 . good form factor5 . opens & closes very well well ( 1st edition I had was a little clunky , had a Samsung China sticker on the inside , 2nd edition I had ( replaced due to bad mic ) does n't have a manufacturer 's tag ) 6. far better reception inside buildings than my previous SE T610 ( w/ Tmo ) 7. camera has great & funny options such as cartoon bubbles and image overlays which all my friends think are hilarious thereby enhancing the blackmail potential or storytelling function of my phone 's camera - good times ! This little feature is silly , but makes me smile so much ; if all features of the phone made me smile like this , I would have kept this phone.Cons:1. lack of customizability- no `` favorites/shortcuts '' - soft keys can not be changed- can not use .3gp files or .mp3 files as ring tones ( on 1st handset ( which I had for 3 weeks but which Tmo replaced due to a microphone problem ) I could , on 2nd handset , this functionality was gone ! I understand Tmo locks this functionality so you have to buy ringtones from them , whatevs Tmo ! ) 2 . lack of functionality- menu inaccessable during calls ( can not text or surf during calls ) - no airplane mode- no notes function- poor Mac supprt- - does not work with Mac iSync ( although , you can send numbers to phone from Mac Address Book ( Menu : Card > Send card ) via Bluetooth , which is at least some convenience , but not the convenience of iSync ) - - my Mac OS 10.2.8 and OS 10.4.6 computers are unable to use dial up networking via Bluetooth or USB cable ( despite the EDGE functionality and the claims of the sweet T-mobile techies who I do n't believe ) - - Bluetooth ( via my Mac ) only browses the memory card as far as I can tell , eg , sees pics only in the memory card3 . GUI is n't well thought out - menu navigation difficult , sending text message requires a number of button pushes once the text is done ( sending a text to multiple people is a major chore ) , finding files is not intuitive , submenus with similar functions are dissimilar between different apps ( compare to the `` File '' menu on all Windows programs , it 's the same because it makes thins easier , Samsung has n't figured this little design STANDARD out ) 4 . 1.3 Mp camera makes 17-40 kb sized pics ... WTF ? ! ? 5 . problem with microSD card staying firmly inserted , aftermarket purchased card ( necessary for music or multiple pics ) pops outI will not buy a Samsung phone again . My phone MUST sync immediately and completely with whatever computer I have whether Mac , Windows , or Linux ; currently the one I have is a Mac . Hello : Mac , Samsung , communitcate ! ! My previous phone , the SE T610 , synched its contact list flawlessly to my Mac . The Samsung t809 database file type is currently incompatible with iSync . Do n't believe claims on this or other websites saying the t809 sync 's with Macs.Every single Samsung product ( phones , home entertainment , etc ) I have bought in the past 3 years has looked pretty and been supposedly loaded with features . However , each was loaded with glitches . No more Samsung for me ! Wish I had gotten a RAZR ( free or nearly so with Tmo ) , held out for a Motorola Capri , or splurged and gotten a fabulous unlocked Nokia ( every one I 've had has been outstanding ) .UPDATE as of November 2006 : The phone is not as sturdy as I had assumed . After having placed the intact phone in my cargo pants pocket , squatting down while painting and standing back up , the phone stopped playing the mp3 I was blaring with the nice loud speaker . I took the phone out of the pocket and HORRORS ! the inside/backside screen was cracked ( the one inside the casing I guess ) which voided the warranty since the Tmo warranty does n't apply to cracked screens . Tmo sent me a replacement , but I sent it back because they were going to charge another $ 150 for this irritation phone .	-1
It looks very sweet . Awesome screen and speakers . Some decent hacks for it on howardforums dot com ! It 's battery life is almost pathetic though . It 's reception is poor . The big exposed screen is also prone to scratching , and getting dust/dirt under it . You also ca n't use mp3 's for ringtones without hacking/cheating it . Rename mp3 to 3gp , copy to micro-sd , then copy back to phone memory.What really killed the deal for me was the reception though . Had a Nokia 3650 , awsome , even worked ok in my basement , next a Moto V330 , barely worked upstairs , just bought 2 of these T809 's and they wo n't even recieve good enough to let me setup my voice mail in my livingroom . Called T-Mobile support.. They are putting in a request to point an antenna towards my house . I 'm request # 2 . I wish they just sold a decent Nokia . Using the phone outside is going to get old once it starts snowing here in Michigan.Bottom line : If you just want a sweet looking phone this is it . If you want a usable dependable phone look elsewhere . This is like the RAZR 's . Form over function . T-Mobile used to have lots of sweet Nokias , then they went to so-so Motorolas , now they are pushing Samdung and whatever is cheap . Not a good thing . - Joe	-1
Beware ! ! I bought an unlocked Razr V3i straight from Motorola , to get the nifty purple color that 's offered only on their website . Bad , bad , bad idea . About a month after I bought it , the phone started to act all crazy - turning off and on randomly , screen going dim , etc . I mailed it in ( the problem later turned out to be the SIM card ) , and when the phone was returned to me it had been LOCKED to the Cingular network.What the heck is going on here ! ! I paid nearly three times more money than a comparable phone , to get an unlocked product - I travel a lot , and the last thing I need is paying Cingular 's outrageous prices for overseas roaming and carrier services.So I called the Motorola customer service number . And waited on hold . And waited . And waited . And finally was connected with a very nice gentleman who promised he would have a supervisor return my call . Well , that was the first call . After a week of no return call , I called again - I wound up having to call a total of four times , with an average of 45 minutes ' hold time each call.When it finally became obvious that nobody was going to return my call , I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau , using Motorola 's Chicago business address as the complainant . FINALLY someone called me back , and - a miracle ! I got a new phone ! However , the story does n't end here . I mailed back the old phone per the instructions , and a week or so later I received the phone BACK from Motorola 's Customer Service - claiming they had already fixed the problem.I 'm still waiting for Motorola to call me back to request their old phone back . There 's nothing wrong with it , except that it 's locked to the Cingular network.The phone itself seems to have good sound quality and range , and it does hold a charge for a reasonably long amount of time . That said , you ca n't save more than ten or twelve text messages on it , and you ca n't back up your messages to your MacBookPro.I bought an Iphone a while ago . I 'll probably still use the Motorola for traveling , but if I were you I 'd think long and hard about purchasing a product for which it 's nearly impossible to redeem the warranty .	-1
I was very disappointed that the head/tip of this cable is too wide to fit through the opening of most shells - while it looks similar in size to a standard OEM/Apple tip , it 's not an is about one-quarter of an inch wider and thus does n't connect to the charge port on the bottom of an iPhone 4 . Very poor design on Belkin 's part .	-1
The first battery held a charge for maybe 6 hours . I contacted MyNetDeals and the very same day they sent me another one . I am using that battery but the charge only lasts two days at the most .	-1
ordered 2 of these a couple of weeks ago , got them in decent time put them in phone and charged them , neither battery lasted more than 48hrs MAX with less than 10 mins talk time.Sent email to company they were nice and sent 2 more batteries plus a return envelope to send first two back with , put in the next ones , charged and same thing within 48hrs both batteries dead with virtually zero talk time on them.Sending all 4 back.Im guessing you basically get what you pay for .	-1
Do n't get me wrong the H3 looks good and sleek but it gives too much feed back . What I mean by that is that when your on the phone , the other party hears an echo . This happend on all the calls . The only thing that kept me from returning it was that I lost the receipt and i threw away the box ! I do n't recomend wasting your money on this . One you may try that has worked for me is the H500 . Cheap looks ok and best of all , it works ! ! ! ! Oh yeah my Razor had a hard time linking to the H3 .	-1
I bought this direct from Amazon , and their `` unlocked '' phone is technically unlocked , but it has Cingular-branded firmware.For anyone not familiar with that , `` branded '' is a euphemism for `` hacked up by the carrier to remove features and replace useful menu options with links to buy stuff . '' I guess `` branded '' is shorter than saying all that.This is not a `` clean '' L7 . You may as well buy an unlocked Cingular phone from ebay.I have not yet checked all features to see what has been removed from this phone , although I immediately notice that even signed Java applications require constant `` permission '' , while an unbranded phone would accept the Verisign certificate .	-1
Pouch felt clumsy . There was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in . Also the clip is so thin that it 's not good with sweatpants or scrubs . With the weight of the phone , it will flip over if it 's not clipped onto a belt .	-1
I 've owned two of these . It is great that it rests against your ear , and is very comfortable not having an earpiece sticking in your ear . The first one I owned , after a month , lost most of its volume . I could not make the volume louder via the volume control ; the volume control actually never seemed to work , but at least at first the volume was real good ... for about a month . The second one I bought lasted about 9 months , but now the button to answer or hang up on a call does not work .	-1
The first headset I was sent was DOA . I was told to pay the return shipping and a replacement unit would be sent out . I did that and received another unit and guess what ... .. Correct it was another defective unit . I have tried contacting the seller multiple times and they have not responded . Anybody want a good deal on a broken headset ?	-1
This product arrived on time but I nor several other people including personnel at Verizon , or Apple could not get it to connect to the phone . So it had to be sent back .	-1
this bluetooth headset is probably one of the worst you can ever waste money on.For some odd reason all of my motorola bluetooth , including this one has really really bad static.I can not clearly hear the other person and the other person can not hear me.I would save my money and buy a different brand altogether.Motorola H700 Bluetooth Headset	-1

After 30 minutes on hold they will now replace the Whole product as ordered and returned # 98686H . Would not refund shipping charges . For those contemplating a replacement make sure they send out the latest headset part # SYN1311B.Remember a company is as the sum of its parts , support 0 stars .	-1
I saw the reviews for this headset on CNET , and I was pretty excited about getting it to use with my LG VX-9400 phone . The Verizon sales agent recommended it to me because they H700 had the same version of bluetooth . That was the reason she gave for my Jabra BT350v having lots of static when using with the 9400.Well , the results with the H700 were actually worse . The callers on the other end said that the static was painful to their ears it was so bad . I heard some static on my end which has never been the case with any headset phone pairing that I 've had . After one day , I boxed it back up and sent it back to Amazon.One thing to note . This must be taken in the context of the phone it was paired with . If you are not using the LG VX-9400 , your experience will likely be different . If at all possible , find a headset that others have already used with your phone and have reported success with . Otherwise you are rolling the dice . Sites like Howard Forums ( Google it ) are good for finding out what others have experienced . Good luck !	-1
I purchased this product for a dive trip to Fiji . While in Fiji I decided to take a kayak out with my camera inside this 'waterproof ' case . The case was sitting between my legs and during the trip out it slid into some water . The water was maybe 2 & # 34 ; deep . It did n't even completely submerge the case . Once I was out a ways I wanted to take a picture of the resort . When I lifted the case I knew there was an issue right away when water came pouring out.My camera was ruined on the 2nd day of my 10-day vacation . There is no place to find another camera . I would have been better off putting the camera in my pocket than this case.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM !	-1
Great interface , but the pen is faulty . I have used the Palm and the pen is easy to use . The pen for the mda does n't work sometimes and it 's operation is n't smooth . The screen is n't very big which is a turn off for such a heavy and bulky tool.The email tool does n't have an option to set business hours so you have it still downloading mail 24hrs , that was n't good . i like my business tool silent when I am at home . And it is locked by T-mobile such that you ca n't install Java applications like Google maps.I returned it , for the weight it should give me the feel of an HP-IPAQ or mini-computer but I did n't get that feel at all .	-1
The MDA , designed and made by Taiwan 's HTC , a leader in the Windows Mobile `` smart phone '' market ( they seem to make all the WM phones sold in the U.S. ) , is really a cool concept . It has a nice shape , a slide-out thumbboard that automatically turns the screen to landscape , and all the goodies that make up Windows Mobile : Pocket Office , Pocket IE , MSN Messenger , Windows Media Player 10 , and tons of free software to download from the web . Plus , it has wi-fi which works really well.I really wanted to like the MDA , as I decided not to get a Palm-based Treo due to severe syncing problems with Outlook ( problems that were supposed to be fixed in the now-vaporware Palm OS 6 `` Cobalt '' ) . And I wanted to like T-Mobile because they are the only carrier out there that forces you on a one-year , not two-year , contract ( and still gives you a rebate ) . Anyway , after a few days I was sorely disappointed . The problem lay entirely with the MDA 's reception . It was almost the same problem I had with the original Sidekick back in 2003 . The MDA 's antenna was never able to grab a signal strong enough to make web surfing any close to being useable . And it would constantly lose and hunt for signal . It was frustrating to no end , even in the heart of Boston where a RAZR tmo phone had full reception . I never got half the speed promised by EDGE , the 2.5G GSM data network . Very , very disappointing . Much , much worse than the EVDO services I had earlier this year tried with Sprint and Verizon.Summary : the MDA has all the potentials of a major league star except the ability/stamina to stick out for more than one inning . It 's a dud , thanks partly to HTC 's poor antenna design and/or construction and partly to T-Mobile 's poor EDGE and GPRS support . If you can stand a two-year commitment , go with Sprint 's PPC-6700 , also made by HTC with the same sliding thumbboard design . I have n't tried the PPC-6700 yet ( cuz I 'm pretty much broke now ) , but online reviews are mostly positive .	-1
Motorola should do better . This product would not install in ether of my state of the art computers . Find a program from another source . Save yourself some headaches .	-1
I 'd like to say I was satisfied with this device , but I 'm not , the ATT version for whatever reason was just SOOO much better than this phone on TracFone , and it was basically the same phone.Just a stupid phone ! ! ! THE ATT VERSION IS GOOD , BUT THIS IS A NO GOOD PHONE ! ! Hello guys , up for reviews today is a phone I once used for tracfone the motorola c139.1st phone , it worked good , i was in the bathroom flushed the toilet and down went the phone , of course it was dead after this and it was gone to the sewer.2nd phone . Had this phone with at & t ; service , instead of tracfone , I noticed a possible ui change , better service and the fact you could use this as prepaid or personal because AT & T ; does not put a sim lock on pay as you go sim cards.The phone was n't that good for texting but it was pretty good also for just the games , I got addicted to the one where there is the ball and it is kind of like brick attack , found on most keyocera phones , but i totally forget the name.3rd phone , was tracfone i got it for my sister , it was washed in the hose , fell and got sprayed an a red dot to prove this . got the screen to change colors and call different people from her contacts , tried drying and then it stopped even working as even a phone , it would go to the tracfone turn on screen reset itself and do it again until you did something like press a button itd go off , or the battery would die.it still mysteriously charged , so it was used for a moto charger , or planned to if i found a phone with the same battery and then all now i get was a lit up keypad . i took it apart , which voided the warranty , if any since wet . now all i got was nothing and figured i should replace it and recycle it which i did .	-1
Beware Tracfone . I regret that Amazon wo n't let me give them 0 stars . We got this phone for my wife 's aunt last December . After 1 year of trying to get this working , she still can not receive calls . She can call out , but no one can call her . Tracfone support is useless ( and generally only marginally speaks English ) . You also can not manage the phone or minutes on line . You have to call in and give them about 60 digits that the phone shows you to do almost anything . We 're letting this one die with over 400 units left on it because it is basically useless . Coverage is n't good either , but who cares if you ca n't receive calls anyway ? There has got to be a better option , because I doubt there are many worse ones .	-1
Sucks , never worked , hated it , threw it away . Total waste of time- there are so many better products out there .	-1
Very poor product quality . I lost my iPhone 3GS due to to water leak using this product . It was working OK for few occasion after sometime ( couple of months of using ) it just stop working and water start to leak .	-1
I bought this for a cruise to protect my phone , cash and other delicate items during a cruise . 5 minutes after being in the water I noticed it was about 1/4 full of water . The bottom developed a hole after extremely light use . The cost ? A ruined iPhone 5s . What a nightmare . I guess it was stupid of me to trust a 12 dollar & # 34 ; waterproof & # 34 ; pouch with a 600 dollar iphone . Lesson learned .	-1
Bought my cable last year and only used it for a couple of weeks before I decided to replace it with a cable from Nokia.This Eforcity unit is made of cheap-feeling material . Takes a bit to plug into my computer and once it is in , still does n't work a lot of times . So I had to unplug and go thru the process a few times.Yes the price is low . But overall the item is too unstable .	-1
This cable functions fine ( at first ) , but it probably wo n't hold up to everyday use . I 've inserted mine maybe 20 times , and one of the spring-loaded contacts just became permanently stuck , making the cable worthless . Sure it 's dirt cheap , which is nice compared to the expensive real Nokia cable , but with what these accessory vendors charge for shipping , I 'd recommend ordering several of these at one time from a source with a good deal on multiple items . I 'm now trying to decide whether to do that myself or shell out for the real deal with a real warranty .	-1
I should have paid more attention to the reviews . I went ahead and ordered these , mostly due to price - nowhere can you find wireless stereo headphones for $ 35 ! There 's a reason , though . After wearing them for only 30 minutes , my ears were very sore . No way of adjusting them . Sound is pretty good , but certainly ca n't overcome the discomfort . Will be returning for credit .	-1
I came across David Pogue 's review of Bluetooth headphones in the New York Times and researched the three sets he mentioned . Compared to the other 's the Jabra BT620 was the cheapest and according to Pogue 's review all the sets performed similarly so I figured i would give it a try as i have been eager to go wireless for sometime . I had 2 simple and common requirements - that it work with my Blackberry 8830 for calls and music and to be able to stream music from my PC around the house . The Former was a no-go from the start as i was told via email that the Blackberry lacked the right 'Profile ' to operate with the Jabra as a music player . Since i already own a regular bluetooth headset for calls the fact that i could n't use the headsets for music was disappointing . As a bluetooth headset the audio was actually pretty good since it covers both ears and cuts out ambient noise but the microphone was very distorted since the micrphone is not on a boom but built into the earpiece . I can not imagine that you can use these as a phone headset since voice quality is a secondary aspect of the design . After some futzing i was able to get the Jabra working with iTunes and Windows Media Player after installing a Bluetooth USB stick on my PC . However disengaging the headsets and trying to sync back to speakers would n't work on either application . The only way i could get it to switch was to reopen the application and in some cases reboot the computer . On the plus side the headphones are well made ( for the price ) , comfortable for my somewhat large head and have good audio quality for most people who are n't audiophiles . The negatives besides the above showstoppers were an extremely short range without breaking up ( 15 feet seems to be the max ) and on a minor note the flashing LED 's which can be turned off but has to be done every time you recharge the device . Overall bluetooth promises simplicity but in my experience was anything but . What started out as a promising technology- connect all your devices wirelessly - became the usual gobbledygook of support calls and technospeak and incompatible standards that left one frustrated at the technology . I sent mine back to Amazon for a refund and will stick with wires for a while longer .	-1
Looks very cool . Very convenient charging via USB port . Not so good sound quality . Audio has a lot of static tics and pops and that is the only reason I give this 2 stars . Everything else is great.Pairs quickly with my Nextel i870.I lost my Plantronics 510 , so will fall back to this unit until I can find the latest earpiece that has received good reviews . Other may have a great experience with this earpiece . Unfortunately , I am not one of them . Maybe I got a `` bad '' one .	-1
The sound quality in the car is great . The callers often complain that they ca n't understand me despite talking directly into the mic.The thing that makes this unuseable is that it often links to my phone but does n't actually connect . I may or may not hear it ringing when I make a call ... and , even though I am connected to the device , when the caller answers , we ca n't hear each other ... .it is n't really connected.so , this is useless	-1
Though the Platntronics Voyager 510 works quite well , I was terribly disappointed with the accompanying carrying case which cost me an addtional $ 25 ! It 's simply too small for the headset !	-1
Do n't buy this adapter ! ! The picture shown is not what you will receive , the picture shows a genuine Nokia adapter but what you get is a cheap piece of crap that does n't even have the same specifications as the Nokia adapter . So if you do n't want to fry your device , do n't buy this .	-1
I want to warn IT professionals that Verizon Wireless phone data email service is inappropriately spoofing sender 's email address in messages sent from Motorola Q . This is creating problems with our anti-spam filters and I also believe this is unethical and should be illegal . We recommend against buying phones with this data/email service in our organization.When we configure our IMAP server option for the Motorola Q phone owned by one of our executives , the Verizon system is `` spoofing '' the email address as if the messages are being sent from our email server . These external but spoofed as internal messages get blocked by our anti-spam filters.When we wanted to try to `` white list '' ( unblock ) the Verizon servers on our anti-spam server , their technical support and Verizon representatives refused to give us the IP addresses of the servers from which email messages are being sent . This was probably refused by their network administrators for security concerns and I do n't blame them for this . I 'm sure they will agree with me that the problem should be instead resolved within Verizon 's system software solution.Instead of spoofing a desired email address , messages coming from Verizon phones should have a distinct `` From '' and `` Reply-to '' addresses , with the first being any external Verizon wireless address , and the latter being the customer 's desired and commonly used email address . The two must differ and only then the messages will not end up as spam because the sender wo n't be spoofed.Although Q seems like a good device , we advise against purchase and do n't support their email integration in our organization until Verizon Wireless makes both `` From '' and `` Reply-to '' fields configurable . Small shops with Microsoft Exchange and loose anti-spam settings probably wo n't have problems like this .	-1
I will be reluctantly getting my 3rd Q ( replacement ) . I 've only had this 2nd one for maybe 2 months . It would freeze constantly during the past 2 months forcing me to remove the battery for a restart . Now I have the dreaded Black Screen of Death with `` motorola flash mode bootloader version : boot_c_03.08.00R_MPAP '' . Anytime bloggers start naming how your phone dies its a very bad sign !	-1
Phone Experience : Its light and sleek and does perform very well as basic phone , charge every 2 days not 2 times a day as I use to do with smartphone.This phone 's interfaces are so old that looks like I am using those old bulky Nokia phones specially switching from smart-phone . This is slow and very limited capabilities . Krzr seems to have lot better interfaces.Verizon Experience : At least I am not getting that many dropped calls as it was with Cingular . Its much better reception.Some things that I encountered so far are : Verizon charges you for 1 month advance monthly access fee , so your first month with activation will cost $ 250-300 excluding phone cost . Next , they charged me $ 15 because I ported my old number , in past I received this service free with T-Mobile and Cingular.Customer service is not friendly at all.Amazon Experience : The sad part of my story starts when I received this phone.I opened the box and it looked like used phone , with dust inside plastic protector and edges coming off and scratches where Mini-SD card goes . I thought its not a big deal so I called Verizon , they came up with resolution after couple calls and hold time that goto store for a free replacement . I went to store , the lady kept trying but nothing happened then a answer that oh may be because you bought phone from Amazon and their customer service should take of this.Ha , who do n't know on this earth that Amazon do n't care for customer satisfaction at all . There is no one who can help you . After few emails I lost hopes and now stuck with this phone.Now I think I should n't have bought it from here , if it was thru Verizon at least I can get new phone.My 2 cents do n't buy from here , its worth buying from Verizon directly in long term .	-1
Overall this is a bad phone . The main reason I purchased it was because it 's very thin and has no antenna . The reception is good and voices come in clear both ways . This is where the positives stop . The worst aspect of the phone is the poor battery life . I have even disabled EVDO so it wo n't switch between it and 1x when moving around town ( which drains the battery ) .The Verizon software makes the phone useless . You can not have the phone ring and vibrate at the same time , you can not change the horrible wallpaper on the front LCD , and you can not change the color scheme from red . Verizon has also disabled the use of Motorola Phone Tool , which enables you to put your own ringtones and media on the phone . You are forced to purchase media from the VCast service . Even if you would n't normally use media on your phone , you should object to this because of principal . It 's corporate greed at its finest and Verizon is preventing you from using the full capabilities of your purchase.It does have a decent camera , but it 's functionality is limited . It takes video clips , but nothing over 15 seconds . There are sites that tell you how to hack the phone , but it 's not worth the time and risk of ruining the phone.The pluses : very thin , no antenna , sleek designCons : horrible user interface , very few options to change the appearance , many of the phone 's functionality has been disabled by VerizonConclusion : buy something else . I succumbed to the hype of the Razr , but was burned . If it were n't for Verizon , the phone would be fine .	-1
I BOUGHT TWO JUST TO HAVE ONE CHARGING WHILE I USE THE OTHER ONE.BIG MISTAKE ! ! ! BOTH STOP CHARGING WITH NO REASONSIT WORKS OK JUST FOR A FEW MONTHS .	-1
I first liked this headset when I got it because of the small size and easy fit without an ear hook . They are reasonably loud and easy to use ( volume , On/Off & paring ) . Charging is simple : drop it in its storage charging case and close the lid.But first , it is somewhat tiny and so you either need to wear it continually in your ear ( hardly cool ) or risk it getting lost in a purse . And because it is so smooth it does not hang in a bluetooth carrying loop that I had on my cellphone case ( slips out ) .The dedicated charging case is also very small and has a dedicated charger with a unique charging tip ( does not work with a mini USB connector or most other charging hubs ) But the most disappointing failure was that the headset would inexplicably disconnect from my AT & T ; Tilt in the middle of a call and the re-pairing would need to be done all over again . When you are driving and expecting a hands-free ride , this is a pretty serious problem.So I am replacing it and hoping that Samsung has addressed these problems with the well-reviewed WEP470 .	-1
Keeps flling off ear . does not work past 4 feet . Bought the Jabra 125 and love it	-1
This is a very small unit & the piece that fits in the ear is rather large . It is a very uncomfortable fit for my adult female ear . The over the ear loop must be removed for recharging . The button controls on the surface and sides of the unit are not difficult to use.I would not recommend this unit for anyone with smallish ears or large fingers .	-1
The sound garbles badly and the battery runs out within an hour . Very neat looking headset but not functional .	-1
After putting myPlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset with Multipoint Technologythrough our washing machine , I thought I 'd purchase a cheap $ 20 replacement . The Plantronics Voyager 510 was a little large but I was always satisfied with the voice quality and fit on my ear . The Samsung WEP200 does not compare in function to the Voyager 510 . I never could get it to attach to my ear and stay there . Nor was the sound quality very good . Overall , Samsung makes great LCD TVs and decent printers . This device , like their Blu-Ray players , is lacking in function and performance . I returned it to Amazon for a refund and will buy another Voyager 510 .	-1
I buy this handsfree . and give me a damaged product ... and send me other ... and damaged tooo..i buy nokia products and NEVER send me a damaged product.. Where is your Quality department Samsung ? ? ? Dont buy samsung products ! ! ! please be wise ! ! ! !	-1
First , the ear clip snapped around the clip that holds it on . Hmm , OK , I 'll replace it.EVERY time that I tried to answer a call with that wondrous `` one button wonder '' I disconnected or worse , could n't hear it loud enough . for whatever Allen Funt reason , this ! # ! @ ? ! ! thing resets to the lowest audio setting all by itself . It does n't fit into my ear ( s ) but sort of hangs over it on that damned cheap earpiece that never held right . Pretty much guaranteed to be a worse distraction while driving than picking up the phone itself : distractingly nonfunctional and some engineer 's idea of punking everybody who buys it.This was a replacement for my lost Samsung headset that was a much better product , but gone , darn it . As such , I 've relegated THIS absurd farce to a place on a shelf until I can conveniently find a way to extract some measure of revenge on it .	-1
I bought this headset on the recommendation of a very picky friend , so I figured it would be great . Wrong . The ear loop is cumbersome to put on , and the ear bud by itself will not stay in my average ear . Worse , you have to place the headset in a recharging box ( ? ? ? ? What happened to a simple plug ? ? ) , meaning that the ear loop needs to come off . A Jabra ear gel fits on the unit . . . but the ear piece needs to come off to recharge . The nail in the coffin is that the ear piece volume is terribly low , necessitating a constant shove of a finger to ensure no aural leakage , even in my ultra-quiet Toyota Sequoia . To be fair , the sound quality was reported to to be very good , but the drawbacks far outweigh the pluses .	-1
Ok , seriously , who are the group of dolts at Samsung approving the release of a products like this ? Did they take the time to at least put it in their ear ? I 'm writing this because they are making newer models , but with zero design improvements.Problem here is not the function or technical aspect , it 's the design . I have no idea who 's ear this is designed for , but it 's not for humans . You would think that with the mention of three ear bud attachments and an ear ring , that some type of combination would be a perfect match for anyone . Not even close.The size is appealing , and the storage case charger is great . It does work well , low noise , and good range . However , it only has about four hours of use before you need to recharge . But , if you have to balance it in your ear , and keep still , or hold it , it kinda defeats the purpose . It being so small and falling out ALL the time also leaves you wondering where it went , and who is either sitting or stepping on it.So , the cheap , flimsy useless piece of plastic thing that attaches to the headset has less value than the strip of plastic that you peel off the top of a milk jug cap . Plus , there is no place to put it . The headset goes in it 's case , but you are supposed to put this plastic strip thing where , exactly ? Certainly not in your pocket as you will mistake it for garbage and throw it out . That must be where mine is , because I have yet to see it in the past few weeks.There are three rubbery ear bud cover things in different sizes . They have an appending ring that may be there for fitting in your ear , or maybe to floss your teeth . Who knows . They do nothing , and the sad part about all of this is that the best fit is when you do n't use any of the included attachments ... but it hurts either way . I had to spend additional money on two different sets of of ear bud covers . One set were foam-like wraps ... useless . And some type of rubber things that just did not fit.Samsung WEP-301 Bluetooth Headset ( Silver ) is the newer model , but it is not any different in design . However , it 's so cheap with rebate , it cost less than the freakin ' earbud covers I wasted money on . Therefore , after this appealing review , and you still want to buy this thing , I would go for the newer one . But , do n't say I ( we ! ) did n't warn you ! NOTE : If you are ok with putting superglue in your ear to keep it attached , please disregard this review .	-1
Ordered this thing on Sep 19th . It did not ship until Oct 26th ! And do n't even get me started about the stupid reasons customer service gave as to why an In STOCK item took that long to ship . Anyway , I finally got it . I was so excited because of the great reviews I read . When I saw the ear hook , I was like WHAT ! This is a flimsy piece of cr @ p ! I thought to myself , `` This is going to break as soon as I use it , so I had better just leave it on . '' Then to my utter AMAZEMENT ! YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OFF TO CHARGE THE DUMB THING ! After the second charge , guess what ? IT BROKE ! Big surprise ! Now I have to hold the unit to my ear to use it , or if will fall out . Not that the ear hook was all that great , the thing still fell off even when it had the ear hook . I ca n't really comment about how well the thing works , because I ca n't keep it charged . After the first complete charge , it died after one phone call . It was about an hour phone call , but gee whiz ! This is my 5th bluetooth ear piece , so I have a little experience with these things . My biggest complaint with the others was low speaker volume and noise interference . I wish I would have had the chance to test this one out but it 's going back to Amazon . Maybe I should file an RMA and then wait a month and a half to ship it back to them . LOL !	-1
this thing is n't comfortable at all ... and does n't stay on my ear worth a darn.It has good connection quality ... but I can barely use it .	-1
This case is worthless with my Motorola HS815 headset . Every time I put the headset in the case , the case squeezes the activation button on the headset . Maybe it will work with headsets that do not have the activation button on the outside surface .	-1
I have gone through three HS850 Motorola headsets . After the first one expired -- largely due to the inability to recharge , brought on by exposure to pockets , etc. -- I bought two BLT-04 cases to take care of the replacement headset I got . At first , the case seemed to be a godsend . It fit perfectly and clipped on effortlessly . Then I realized that it also clipped off just as effortlessly . I figured I 'd be careful enough and kept the case . While packing boxes for moving , I did not notice that clip slipped off and fell into one of the boxes along with the headset . By the time I realized what happened , all the boxes were packed , sealed and ready to go to storage . It 's not as bad as losing the set on a street , but , still , I am unable to use it until boxes get unpacked . Luckily , the price dripped from $ 80+ for the headset to around $ 30 and I did not hesitate to get a replacement . But I am not putting it into the case -- it 's safer in my pocket .	-1
I bought the BLT-04 case to use with the Motorola H700 headset . It fits the headset very nicely , but.. But , the design of the case does not prevent the multifunction button from being pushed if the case is at all squeezed , even though there is a recess in the case cover you 'd think would prevent that . The result is that I 'd often find the pairing light on and the battery close to drained.If you are going to clip the case on a shirt pocket , it might be ok , though even the tension of the elastic of the case is enough to push the headset button . If the case will be put inside a briefcase or purse , then you should probably reconsider .	-1
This is a very comfortable headset and was quite easy to set up with my Motorola phone . The sound quality is as good as other headsets I 've used , and people on the other end of a call have told me that my voice is clearer . However , I 'm VERY disappointed with how poor the battery life has been . I get less than 1 hour of talk time and less than 48 hours of standby time . I could go over a week with my old Nokia bluetooth headset .	-1
Well , I went ahead and bought this at the reduced price . It was good at first and then other people were having problems hearing me and I was misunderstood because of this headset . Thankfully , it was n't one of my important calls and just resulted in a bit of confusion between that person and me . I am returning this product because it is just not worth it to me if the other person can not hear me properly . I do like the design of it and the fact that you get to choose how you place it in your ear . I do n't care about it otherwise .	-1
Did not work well with my phone .	-1
This bluetooth was my first and worst . I could n't hear alot on it and it did n't stay on my ear for nothing . I would stay away .	-1
I used to have a Motorola H500 which worked well for my phone . Unfortunately I misplaced it . So I eventually bought another one via Amazon . When I got it , it worked but had a hissing and crackle sound . I thought it was my phone and the problem would eventually go away . It did not . This was suppose to be a brand new headset . It 's defective and I did not return it immediately . So I 'm giving this supplier a 1 star .	-1
Item was purchased to replace a Motorola 300 headset . Worked ok but , paired fast . Volume was ok but could have been louder . Biggest drawbacks were callers could barely hear me if I was not using my 'outside ' voice which is annoying to others around you . The other complaint is the fit . I still do not understand how Motorola engineers enjoy this design . It feels like it is going to fall off and on occasion does . Item was returned within 30 day policy of where it was purchased . Here is where I am at currently with headsets ... .this is my review for the cardo scala 700lx that I currently own and am very happy with so far . I feel the cardo is a better unit for comperable price.My first bluetooth was a Motorola . I have not been happy with the Motorola fit as it feels like it is going to fall off ... and on occasions it has . I am also replacing the motorola because I now have 2 cell phones I need to carry and want to use both simaltaneously . To replace it , I found a great deal on a Jabra BT5010 . Great headset , so good , my wife stole it . Went to buy another and the price had gone back up . I tend to lose or damage things , so I have set a budget of no more than $ 30- $ 40 . I then found a deal on a Jabra BT5020 . I had received a bad unit and the exchange from another buy.ing website went bad and finally received my money back . Again , went to buy another and the price had gone up . This led me to the Cardo 700lx.First off , the fit is by far the best of the 3 I have had . I can honestly say , I have forgotten it was on and it can startle you when a call comes in . After 5-10 minutes , you dont even notice it on at all . Extremely light weight . A 5 star in my book . Where as , the motorola is a 1 star , the BT5010 is a 3 star , and the BT5020 is a 3.5 star.Next is ease of use . I like the placement of buttons . The main button on front has a definate click to it so you know you have pressed it and does n't leave you guessing . The rocker volume dial on back is great for adjusting volume and can be reversed if placing on your left ear so rocking up is always louder and rocking down is quieter . Pressing the dial in also has function as well . Neat , simple design and easy to access with larger fingers . Again , 5 star.Finally is funtionality . This is where I have to question my rating . I know this is not a $ 50 headset , $ 75 headset , or even a $ 100+ headset and wont rate it/compare it to such . I understand you get what you pay for . With that said , here is my humble opinion . The headset has great volume and sounds as good as using the phone itself . However , the range is not as good at the others I have used . The Headset operates best with the phone in sight . Static is noticed by the caller ( not me ) if the phone is on my body the opposite of each other . In the car , it is best to place in the right ear and the phone in the center console or passenger seat . If you want to use it in the left ear , the phone should be on that side . Same side line of sight distance is approximately 10-12 feet before static comes in for the caller . Call quality is always good on my end , however again , the caller definately knows you are on a headset as it does have a slight echo . Again , I know this is not an expensive headset and is not perfect . But , no caller has complained when asked . Some did n't even know I was on a headset . Background noise is an issue for the caller though . One does need to close the windows , turn down/off the radio , lower the HVAC fan for a quality business conversation.Final note comes to the multiple bluetooth pairing function . The main feature I was looing for was having a headset that would work with 2 phones . Since I carry a personal phone and a work phone , I want to answer and use both without changing phones or settings . The Jabra 's were good , but voice recognition , redialing , and funcions only worked with the last phone paired up . That means , if you wanted to use the 1st phone you connected , you had to find the phone and manually use it . Not bad if it is seldom used . As for me , I use each phone equally . This headset allows you to double tap the volume rocker to switch between each phone . Great feature that allows full function use of each phone . The only drawback is that only one phone is 'active ' at a time on the headset . Meaning , if you are talking on phone 'A ' and then hang up ... minutes later phone 'B ' rings , you do not hear it in your headset and must listen for the phones ringer/vibrate . Then , once you hear the other phone ring , you double tap the volume rocker to switch over to the phone 'B ' . A drawback to be able to use full function of 2 phones . In the Jabra 's , the headset would ring for each phone without doing anything ( great ) , but voice dialing was only for the last phone paired.Added benefits include not having to by accessories . It come in the box with a wall charger , car charger , usb charger , and a belt/carry pouch.In conclusion , great headset for $ 30 . In that price range ( under $ 50 ? ? ) it is a 5 star . Is there better out there . Certainly . But you have to double , if not , triple the price . For $ 30.00 , I am extremely happy and would recommend it to others .	-1
It acted as thought it was muted when it was n't . I tried it on two separate cell phones and it did the same thing on both phones . The person being called could hear the first syllable and that was it . I did try to turn the mute off , all it did was change the frequency of the buzzing sound the other person heard .	-1
While I will agree that the device works as advertised and the sound quality is pretty decent this headset has caused me more heartache in annoyances to outweigh any benefit . If you buy this be prepared for the device to turn on and off at very in opportune times ... .. but if you want to turn it off , thats a whole different story . Powering the device on and off requires holding the button down for a certain period of time but the problem is that the time required seems to change each time you do it . Add to this that holding the button down for a period of time shorter than the period of time required to turn it off is actually a redial function . I have FREQUENTLY called someone just by trying to turn off the device . The button is also entirely too sensitive . I 've had the device in my cargo pants pocket ( where this would be very little pressure on the device ) and the unit has turned on and actually called someone.Other issues are the charging indication is n't real clear and there is n't any idea of knowing how charged the battery is and the device is n't quite as comfortable as other devices that I have used ( its bearable but there is definately more comfortable for the money ) .	-1
It fits the phone , but has a crappy , cheap feel to it . It collects fingerprints and does n't seem to do anything but add bulk to an already large phone .	-1
This case is ok , but there are certainly better ones out there for cheaper.I ordered this case with high expectation thinking i was going to recieve a brand name product from Boxwave , instead i recieved a generic case with no branding .There are other cases here on amazon and other sites that are exactly the same thing i recieved for less then half the price this one is being sold for.For some reason my comments doesnt get approved im not sure why , just letting you all know my personal experience with this transaction .	-1
I sold my Discovery 650 and upgraded to the 655 because I thought the DSP would cut the noise in the car . Boy , was I disappointed . Not only did it sound a lot worse to people on the other end , but it sounded a lot more choppy on my receiving end as well.It stays in my ear fairly well , even without the ear loop -- just the eargel . BUT ... The eargels unclip too easily when in a pocket , bag , or ESPECIALLY when in the pocket-clip charger . If I have it clipped on my pocket , the eargel faces out and unavoidably rotates to its removal position . When I brush up against anything the eargel flips out . I 've lost two eargels now and it just sits in a drawer.They should have designed a better retention mechanism on the eargel with some kind of positive release mechanism , and/or have the eargel facing back when it 's in the clip in a pocket so it wo n't get torn off.I also hated the force required on the buttons . I never used the volume controls ( always did it from the phone ) , and I dreaded getting calls because I 'd have to MASH the answer button into my head.One more thing -- It 's always getting `` unpaired '' from my Treo 680 . I have to go through the Treo menus to get it to pair again . To be honest , this may have to do with the Treo more than the headset , but the two do not like each other that well.The Discovery 650 without the DSP had much better audio quality , slightly lighter force on the buttons , but the same problems with eargels getting torn off in my pocket. -- - UPDATE -- -I called Plantronics tech support and they immediately sent me out new eargels . So I 'm using it again .	-1
I thought this thing would be great because it was so small and I could use my normal chargers with it but it broke soon after I bought it .	-1
Product came without shipping slip , no protective packaging . .Bluetooth was placed in a plastic bag , slipped in an envelope and mailed . Quality is very poor . Crackling , buzzing muffled sounds very annoying and diapointing to recieve something you are expecting to use all the time to not being able to use it . I would not recomend this vendor to anyone . Description stated very clearly that it would be packaged in retai packaged and pictured with extra items . This came with bluetooth only and charge cord ; no instruction or any other accessories with this .	-1
Although weight , sound and battery are good , I really dislike this headset 's design . If you are a totally predictable person who does the same thing every day and never gets dirt on your cuffs , it 's ok . If you are on the go , the wire clip will come loose in your pocket or in your computer bag . The pen holder does n't do anything to shield the clip , in fact it adds weight that causes more force against the exposed headset . I had to recrimp the loop to make it tight enough not to come loose . The pen cap itself is required baggage for no good reason . Rather than give you a standard mini usb connector on the device , you must now haul this cap everywhere . Hey , I do n't always wear a shirt with pockets . After two weeks I misplaced it on a trip and so the expensive headset is sitting on the shelf while I ponder whether to buy another useless pen clip or to cook up my own connector . There is no excuse for non-standard connectors and charging solutions , but watch this company do it over again . ( several months later ) I finally am tossing out this headset . The pen clip holder was eventually found and I tried to make a go with this device . I do n't like to get rid of working items , but I have had the earpiece and ear hook fall off many times in my pocket and this last time , they fell elsewhere and are lost . Would you believe it could n't even stand up to the pressure of the inside of my suit coat ? I did get a box to carry it in , but that was cumbersome because of the charging holder , and now it does n't matter because I would have to buy a new hook and earpiece . Just ordered a Motorola H500 , lower cost , lots of color choices and very long talk time PLUS a standard mini USB jack . I got a travel case for less than $ 4 . Got one for my daughter for Xmas and she proved it to be a better headset .	-1
The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on . I had to send the first one back because it would n't turn off . I have the replacement , and still have the ear hook issue , and it does n't stay in my ear without it . I 'll be buying another bluetooth , but this will do for the time between ordering .	-1
The sound is horrible in the car . My fiancee said that it sounded like there were bubbling noises when I was talking to her via the headset . So I called my home and left a message on my answering machine . Horrible ! I could hardly hear myself over what sounded like bubbles in a fish tank . Garbage . Your mileage may vary , but I would highly recommend you consider a different headset .	-1
I am replacing this headset ( It replaced an Explorer 320 ) with a 510 because I am sick and tired of swivel earhooks getting loose and falling off-which is apparently NOT a warranty issue according to Plantronics . Their recommendation ? Replace the headset . I ordered my 510 tonight-ca n't wait to replace this one . Note-it drops calls frequently , which I know is a cell-phone company issue because it happens with the phone too . But the swivel earpieces are ridiculous . I could have bought a 520 for $ 2 more but chose not to because of the SWIVEL !	-1
I really do n't have a lot of time . That is why I shop online , So if I 'm purchasing an item that is to be used to make life more convenient , like a Bluetooth headset , it really is obnoxious to receive one that is & # 34 ; worse than sucks & # 34 ; . This item did not even charge . Plantronics really needs to pull this item because it is really damaging to their reputation to have this out there for sale . I choose Plantronics because as a Regional Sales Manager/Road Warrior , I 've always had luck with Plantronics . Too bad that this one was a lemon .	-1
The sound quality is fine ... as long as you keep your phone no further from the earpiece than your shirt pocket . This thing has NO range to it . It 's unfortunate because it has an otherwise solid design . The single rocker switch is slick and intuitive . All the design in the world does n't mean a lick if it just does n't work .	-1
This product is junk . Had it less than a month and it stopped working . Dont waste your money .	-1
The sound was great , but the headphones were poorly constructed and they broke . The headphones have a really annoying & # 34 ; police like & # 34 ; blue light . The light disturbed others around me .	-1
I bought the 590 's because they 're one of the few bluetooth stereo headphones that get overall good reviews , both at Amazon and tech websites like CNET . I 've had mine for about a week . I want to use them for music listening and Skype calls through my computer.So far I can only get them to work as stereo headphones . In that respect , they sound very good.However , I 'm unable to get them working as a phone headset with my computer . The problem is the microphone . When I try Skype 's test call , I can hear the lady speak , but Skype can not hear me speak.On my Windows XP laptop , I can connect the 590 's as 'stereo headphones ' or as a 'hands free headset with microphone ' . After connecting as a headset , I hear odd beeps about every 5 seconds . The beep pattern is not described in Plantronics ' skimpy User 's Manual.I 've configured my computer 's sound system to use bluetooth for playing and recording audio . I 've tried pressing the 590 's Phone and Mute buttons to unmute the microphone , but nothing seems to work.I 'll call their support number to try and make the 590 's work for Skype calls . I hope they work out , because they 're light and sound great .	-1
Very flimsy , cheap product . Takes 8 seconds MINIMUM to turn On/Off . Battery life only a couple days . I sure expected better from the previous reviews .	-1
I have been a satisfied Virgin Mobile ( VM ) customer for several years , happily using an Audiovox 8500 . VM uses the SPRINT cellular network which has a strong signal in my area.Lets talk about the SLICE which is made by UTSTARCOM . I was very much attracted to this thin stylish cell phone . I am not going to waste any time - what you see is what you get . It is basically a pretty phone with very good reception , but the outgoing voice quality is below average . The person on the other end will think you are swallowing water while talking . Another issue is the cramped key pad.This cell phone reminds me of a pretty girl with the voice of cartoon character . If you prize fashion over function - go for it.I am switching back to my AUDIOVOX.P.S . You will feel compelled to purchase additional `` wallpaper '' for an additional $ 2 , because what comes on the phone as standard fare is ugly !	-1
Picked this up from Radio Shack as a novelty item . The phone is thin , but the call quality is quite poor . Virgin Mobile uses Sprint 's PCS network , and Sprint is my primary provider ( I have a new Sanyo M1 phone ) , and the call quality difference is huge . The keypad is also uncomfortable to use , like many ultra-thin phones -- just not designed for normal human beings IMHO . Finally , VM 's prepaid rate is just too high . Coupled with limited coverage , I 'd say VM 's service is a bad deal .	-1
This charger , just would n't charge ... probably it was not chosen well , but at most ... .could have been used as was anticipated ... ... ..	-1
When it arrived I went to plug it in and noticed one of the prongs was bent . I went to bend it back and it broke ! Then I noticed rust at the base of the broken prong . I 'm sending it back for a refund and wo n't be buying another one .	-1
Does not work with iPhone 3GS at all . First time I tried it it said Accessory not optimized for iPhone . I think Amazon should remove the listing .	-1
DO NOT buy this charger . You will probably never see this review because nobody wants you to know what this charger will do to your Apple device ! ! It will destroy it !	-1
Do you have some money to waste ? Buy this item . It is broken at 2nd day of use and does not stand phone . I rated 1 star because there is not less	-1
I cant say how yours is going to hold up but the one that I purchased did not hold up . The first day , the first time that I put this on my belt and went to sit in my car , it broke . The belt clip shattered into millions of pieces . The only thing that is of use and that is why I at least gave it 2 stars was the case itself . It is of the best that I have seen yet . High quality looks and feel.and the ergonomics are very good too . It just feels good . The problem is , that I wanted a holster with the case and if the clip breaking off is any indication to the rest of the quality on down the road than just get something else .	-1
Thin materiel would not last long , inexpensive looking . Did not look anything like what I seen on the ad , returned item .	-1
I wouldn & # 8217 ; t recommend this item in white ... ..it was discolored within one week of purchase . This case was discolored very quick just from normal use .	-1
Case did not protect the front of the phone and it made the back square instead of rounded fits in holster well but I did not like the feel on the phone I sent it back	-1
This only last one week ... .The belt clip is made from a cheap plastic ... ! I like the kick stand to watch movies but that is it ... .Do not buy ... .D	-1
These do not work well and are very cheap . Sending back today ! DO NOT waste your cash on this product at all . I have got so many better quality cases from different places on Amazon then what this one .	-1
Snapped off the belt clip in less than a week just getting into a car . Same problem many of these style cases have , look for metal clips instead of plastic . This is a real problem with the Note 2 as it is big enough that it is only a matter of time before it snags on something no matter how careful you are . And if the clip is cheap and weak , your phone is going to the floor and your holster is now worthless as the clip snaps off .	-1
It was in the case and on my belt and the phone slid right out and busted on the pavement . Get yourself a real caste .	-1
As soon as I wrote and recommeded this product it broke , have not had it quite 3months , need a relacement already , understand what other customers concerns were now , could not stand the test of time !	-1
I did n't really care for this one . i do n't use it that much because it does n't give much protection for my phone , which is pretty expensive . there are really no *pluses* to having this cover ... it was inexpensive and shipped quickly tho ...	-1
This thing snapped . The clip got caught on something and snapped right off . There was no way to fix it , broken plastic .	-1
well i got the BoxWave Holster and i went to use it for the First Time TODAY and it has a crack on the side of it i want a Replace ment can you please send me the replace ment for it ( The Belt clip side of the case has the crack on it )	-1
Looks good but dont trust your phone in this . My phone fell out the first day in this case . should have a clip on top to keep the phone from sliding out . gave it two stars for looks but functionality ... ... .. it sucks .	-1
It was cheap but the clip broke in less than a week . The very first day , the clip/kickstand popped off . Just clipping it to my belt , the natural movement of going about my day would pop the clip off the case and the phone would hit the ground . After a few days of the clip popping off , and me putting it back on , the plastic that held the clip on broke . I definitely would n't recommend this .	-1
I received this on the 7th , it broke on the 10th . I did n't hit it on anything or catch it on anything . Stay away from this it is cheaply made garbage .	-1
This case would be OK if it fit . None of the holes line up , camera slot , stylis port etc . I will gladly accept another holster that fit correctly . Because this phone is so large I need a belt clip .	-1
The holster does not hold my husbands phone . As soon as he puts his phone in the holster it slides right out . This makes him have to clip the case/holster inside his pocket instead of outside ... .which makes the holster pointless !	-1
I bought three different TPU cases for the LG G2 . This case simply does not fit . The top and bottom of the will not stay tight against the phone and bulges . Also , this case does not form fit to the nice curved sides of the phone .	-1
I love the fit and feel of this case for my s4 . However , it is not shock as shock absorbing as I need . I do not feel my phone is protected from even minor drops that inevitably happen with regular use of phones . This spec quickly and was in original , sealed packaging .	-1
Felt cheaply made . bought a different one to replace it . 2 stars because the kickstand was functional . There are better cases for the money or a little bit more	-1
I bought this because of all the positive 5 star reviews . This case is nice and slim and is cheap . The big problem is it makes using the phone so much harder . A normal press of the buttons does nothing . You have to push really hard . I guess all the 5 star reviews have never used the phone with a case with cut outs .	-1
This case is far from what I expected . The kickstand is awkwardly placed and it does n't feel very comfortable when holding it . In addition the case is really thin . I wish I never hit the confirm purchase button .	-1
I did n't feel that this was a very sturdy product . It felt very flimsy but I tried it and was afraid to drop phone .	-1
ordered my case 9 days ago..it should have arrived yesterday . there is no tracking but they give me a tracking number ... ..wheres my case.. you charged my card but no product..	-1
This review is for the BoxWave case with stand . The reason I have to say that is because BoxWave has NINE different cases on this one listing ! I could understand if the & # 8220 ; Size & # 8221 ; option was for different models of phones , but to have be different CASES is just misleading , and probably saves BoxWave money on listing fees.As for the actual case & # 8230 ; I bought this because it was one of the & # 8220 ; Best Cases & # 8221 ; for the s4 as per Cnet . I don & # 8217 ; t know what the deal is , however this case is pure garbage ! The cutout for the bottom microphone is so off-center that the microphone is actually covered ! As a result , I sounded muffled to the person on the other end of the line . The cutout for the camera is the same way . For normal pictures , it is OK as it case does not block the lens , however it does partially cover the flash . As a result , you get glare on the bottom of the photo from the flash.The Kickstand is useless . There is nothing to lock it in place , so the phone falls over unless you balance it & # 8220 ; just right. & # 8221 ; Even then , once you tap the screen ( ie : skip a You Tube add ) , the phone falls over . Also the hinge on the back of the phone causes the phone not to lay flat.I paid $ 4 for this case , and I got the type of quality one would expect for a $ 4 case . I WOULD NOT suggest this case if you are looking for a Kickstand case . Other cases on this listing & # 8220 ; might & # 8221 ; be a better quality case , however , I would not hold my breath . To be honest , the cheap quality of the case I received , and the deceptive nature of the listing , I WILL NOT buy another BoxWave case .	-1
Ordered this to cover and protect my new SGS4 . It covers the phone , but the holes for the mics dont line up centered over the holes and the buttons are nearly impossible to push ( you really have to reef on them ) .	-1
Did NOT fit correctly for my Samsung S4 ( AT & T ) . I guess I got what I paid for . Be careful if you 're particular about your case and want it to fit snug on your phone . This case is not a tight fit and is loose on the sides . I gave this case away or else it would 've just collected dust in my drawer . I would not recommend this case to anyone !	-1
I thought this item was clear but it had a grey hue . After a few days of use it began to look cheap and dirty . I would not buy this color again .	-1
This case was okay ... The rubbed edge is nifty but then the plastic was just thin and the kickstand is just poorly made ... not to mention it 's very hard to pull the kickstand out .	-1
Shows up totally deformed ( top of the case does n't even touch the phone because it was cast crooked ) , and I have to pay to mail it back to them if I want a replacement ? I do n't want a replacement anymore , I want a functional phone case . Definitely a & # 34 ; get what you pay for & # 34 ; kind of thing . The case is pretty inflexible , so when I took the case off , it also pulled off the back of the phone . Not the end of the world , but definitely a crappy case . Would absolutely not recommend .	-1
Do n't buy this cheap ugly product ! Worst mistake in buying a case for my phone . EEW ! Never Again ! NO ! NO !	-1
I bought this case because it was very cheap . I should have known it was not worth it . The case fit is too tight . When I put it on my phone , the lip that goes around the front of the phone was uneven . No matter how many times I tried to take it off and put it back on again , the lip was just uneven . This caused my screen protector film to be displaced by this case . It was much more of a pain than a help . Get the real Samsung case and save yourself the headache .	-1
I did n't like this case to hard to put on the phone . I struggled wit getting it on . Imagine getting it off . Did not like	-1
This case does look good and it is comfortable to hold , but for 16.95 it should be better . The cut outs fit well enough , but the buttons are much harder to press when the case is on.I feel that for this price it should be significantly better than my 3 dollar no name TPU case i bought on Amazon . It is not , so why spend more money for nothing special . If you are going to spend this type of money , you better get something for it.Go and check the Ballistic SG caseBallistic SG0867-M385 Soft Gel Case for Samsung Galaxy Note - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black Silicone/Black TPU/White PCfor the Galaxy Note to see what a proper case should be like ; or just get that cheapo TPU case.Boxwave is just fleecing customers with this overpriced case .	-1
I bought two , but they sent three ; took 4 weeks to get in mail , as they 'd warned when purchasing ; wrapped up to look like OEM , but I 'm thinking it 's a fake ; people selling it certainly have n't responded to my complaints ; works no longer than my 4 and 6 year old OEM batteries scavenged from other folks dead Moto V3 RAZRs . Wish I could give them NO STARS on this one .	-1
I bought this battery several years ago for my RAZR V3 , as the battery was about shot in it , and I shoulda just saved my money . This was not worth the time , effort or money . It would n't hold a charge for longer than an hour . Probably not a relevant review today , but still not worth your money	-1
Extremely disappointed in this product . It is n't the sellers fault , but the Razor ca n't hold a charge longer than 35 minutes.I bought this battery in expectance that maybe it would be better . I was totally wrong . Thankfully I bought a new phone.Do n't waste you 're time buying a new battery , instead save up and buy a new phone ! Trust me I did .	-1
Do n't wast your money on this battery china made wo n't hold charge . I bougth 2 end up throwing it away .	-1
This is the 3rd `` OEM '' battery I bought via Amazon Marketplace -- as with the others , it was terrible . I ordered form the OEM shop a BR50 . They sent a BR56 which is supposed to be even better with 3 hours talk time . It did not last 30 minutes after a complete overnight charge . Nowhere as long as the battery I am trying to replace which lasts over an hour instead of the original 2 1/2 hours.OEM sent a counterfeit fake battery -- - not OEM . How can you tell ? Because Motorola OEM batteries are made in Japan . These say clearly that they are made in china . I had the same problem and returned the same battery from Wireless Phone Accessories and Batteries4Less.AMAZON_- you should be screening these sellers and addressing these issues . There are a ton of posts under every single one of the Motorola Razr battery listing that say they got bad or counterfeit batteries.Theses companies make their money by selling junk , counting on the Amazon customer not to feel it is worth the hassle to return it . For every one I have to return I lose an hour of my time . My time is worth more than th $ 10 I get ripped off for . But I do it anyway b/c hopefully at some point AMAZON is going to take responsibility for the conduct of their market sellers . AMAZON 's new logo is to become the most customer centric company on earth . Well AMAZON , you can start here : Bargain Cell -- which is one of the worst offenders , Wireless Phone Accessories and nowThe OEM Shop -- what a joke for a name for the last one since clearly they KNOW they are selling counterfeit batteries.I paid $ 30 for one from batteries4less hoping to get the real deal -- I got the exact same batter I got from the OEM shop -- the exact same counterfeit . So it has nothing to do with the price paid . Just dishonest online sellers .	-1
This is the second one they sent me , both are complete trash . After 1 or 2 charge cycles it dies within 5 minutes when fully charged . DO NOT BUY	-1
This product ( version 4.0 ) works with my V3 and V3x . It does NOT work with my new V3e.I am using the overpriced Version 4.0 disc purchased directly from Motorola.Software updates still do not recognized the V3e . Not sure which models listed work and which do n't , but the fact that non-supported models seem to be listed is sufficient to be skeptical and go elsewhere . Yeah , and it 's a penny , PLUS a lot in shipping ! So , if the software works for you , it is pretty nice . If not , you 're out . I gave a review of one star based on the fact that a model I KNOW does n't work is in the supported list .	-1
Knowing the wide range of reviews of this product , I ordered it anyway and would return it if it really did n't work out.Here 's the summary : I spent much of two days trying every possible combination of signal antenna location : inside , outside , 10 feet high , 20 feet high , near a window , in the attic . I followed the instructions and kept the base unit as far away as possible , with as much vertical separation as possible . I oriented the base station antenna vertically and horizontally.Nothing worked . I called Wi-Ex technical support and their recommendation was to buy the additional directional antenna and aim it at one specific tower . I decided I did n't want to spend more and risk still not having the repeater work , so I returned it instead.Now the detail . I did quite a bit of background work . I live in the middle of a nice flat part of Silicon Valley and there is no lack of towers around . My house is a single-story wood frame ; no big buildings around and no hills . There are 3 AT & T ; cell towers within 0.85 miles ( I found them and measured distance ) . The problem is that I happen to be located almost exactly in between and equidistant from these three towers , and apparently their power is adjusted so that they do n't overlap a great deal . In other words , I get three sets of signals , none particularly strong , and depending on specific conditions at any moment in time the strongest signal comes from any of these three towers at random . So the phone is constantly hunting for a signal , and rarely gets one very strong for very long.The YX510 repeater uses an omnidirectional signal antenna , in other words it will see all three towers the same way my phone does -- varying in relative signal strength constantly . It will simply repeat that mixed up signal . Furthermore , the YX510 will ratchet its boost down if it detects a strong signal , which happens every once in a while . So it is easy to see what is happening . The repeater can not help this situation and in fact makes it worse by occasionally ratcheting boost down when it happens to get a short burst of a strong signal . The end result was that my cell reception was no better with the repeater than without -- not better , just `` different '' -- I was stuck more often in Edge than without , but I did often have 2-3 bars as long as I was in line of sight of the base station and no more than 15 feet away . Beyond that , I lost signal.The solution would appear to be to use a directional antenna and aim it at one tower . This would potentially solve these issues : the phone would not hunt between towers and the YX510 would not get a wildly varying signal strength ( I think ) . However , I 'm not ready to make that jump yet and will need to do some more research.I was also not very impressed with the construction or the instructions for the YX510 . I will want to look at other options ( all of which , BTW , are substantially more expensive , but generally the companies offering them have longer track records ) .The YX510 with omnidirectional signal antenna is probably a good product when there is a single , dominant cell tower nearby . In my case , with multiple equal-strength towers ( but at marginal strength ) , it did not help at all . Since Wi-Ex tech support knew the problem immediately when I described my situation , it appears they are aware of it -- which IMHO means they should make it clearer what the limitations are . The marketing material and the installation guide are written to promote the idea that you just throw the stuff up and it should work . RF just is n't like that.Thanks to Amazon , returning it was easy .	-1
Got two of these headsets because of high reviews.Used both headsets on PS3 , had a lot of troubles getting it to work correctly and sync with the console.The audio seems a to have some static and the mic doesnt transfer you voice clearly.I bet there are better options . Maybe these arent the real Jabra headsets ?	-1
I am a first-time Bluetooth user . I guess I must have ears a lot larger than the people for which this product was designed . It does not fit me , and therefore it is unusable.So , my recommendation is that you try before you buy .	-1
The shape of the hard plastic ear hook was designed to cause pain - note the 2 hard plastic jagged corners turned towards your ear while the rounded portion faces up and away from any skin that it could interfere with harming.My second complaint would be that you must hold it against your ear to be able to hear anything thus defeating the point of a `` hands free '' headset.The price is good and if you wear it in silent places where you stand a chance of hearing through it then it 's almost usable but I 've gotten Motorola 500 headsets for about the same price on Amazon and they work much better and are comfortable as opposed to painful .	-1
A bit tough to put on . Thick is great for durability but makes it impossible to use with case and have no bubbles . looks great on until it gets used the . Smudges and scratches are all you notice plus not easy to see In bright conditions	-1
These things may work decently , but the reason for using them is completely awful . Oh , and after about 2 weeks , I could only hear static through the headset while speaking , which would not happen when I used the same headset with my computer	-1
Worst item I 've ever purchased . Brand new batteries wont ' even fully charge my phone once . Do n't buy it . The regular stores have stopped carrying it because it keeps getting returned because it does n't work worth a darn .	-1
While this product does charge our BB 8703e it does so in a flaky way . You need to insert/remove the plug several times before the unit will start charging.Also , it would seem that if you leave the batteries in the unit while not charging they get drained over time.All in all a good idea that was not executed correctly .	-1
I wanted to use rechargeables ( good performance and inexpensive ) and keep this in my briefcase as a backup charger.That was the theory . if you use anything other than lithium ( very expensive ) or alkaline ( Poor performance ) the positive contact will not touch . ( I tried 6 different brands of rechargeables ) I ended up taking it apart ( disassembly is fairly easy ) to put a solder blob on the positive terminal . Now it makes contact with my NiMH batteries but the battery cover on this thing is really flimsy . Add to that the blinking blue light - certainly gets your attention but it ends up being VERY annoying . I tried to charge my Moto Q in my car ( while using a BT headset ) and I had to cover the charger with my coat.I ended up buying a noname made in China charger for less than half the price , it has a screw on battery cover and a red LED rather than these super bright blinking blue ones . And of course , it accepted rechargables with no modifications.Basically there are better designed products out there for a lot less .	-1
This is the best bluetooth headset I 've owned in terms of comfort and sound quality . The microphone seemed to be fine.The ear pieces are unfortunately attached to the head band via thin plastic . In my case , I experienced structural failure after 14 months of light usage.If you 're going to spend more than $ 100 on headphones , buy something that is more stout than this particular model .	-1
I originally had the black wep , which worked fine . I upgraded to the red sync from cingular and wanted the red wep . Everyone I spoke to told me I sounded like I was in a tunnel , could never hear me , which was n't an overall good experience . Cute in color , small and useful , but no one could hear me clearly when I was on it .	-1
talking on it sounds like you are far away my phone customers say . Very small , can be awkward to keep in ear	-1
Tried this speaker for a few weeks in my car but my wife and others complained they could not hear me over the background noise . I tried eliminating or reducing the noise in my car ( radio , A/C fan , ect ) but nothing seemed to work even if the speaker was attached to the drivers ' visor .	-1
AVOID AVOID AVOID . Will not hold a charge . A useless piece of junk . Get something better made . Not this POS .	-1
I have owned this speaker for a few years now.Here 's what I like about this device : * Relatively low cost* very compact . smaller than a credit card - I take it with me when I travel in case my rental car wo n't have BT* speaker quality is acceptable* very simple* turns off automatically if phone is out of range for a while* long battery life* uses standard USB for charging* easy to pair , but you will have to be just a little 'techy'.Here 's what I do n't like : * inconsistent quality . Sometimes I get complaints from people saying they ca n't hear me . sometimes it works fine though . Bottom line is I can not trust it for important calls . * the blue blinking light is very annoying at night and to my best knowledge can not be disabled* need to remember to turn the device on when you get into the car . However , connection is established pretty quickly.I still use this device , mainly to use with my phone as a navigation device . I also make calls sometimes but I ca n't really trust this device for important calls so I would not recommend this device overall . It 's OK , but I would pay more to get better ( and more consistent ) sound quality .	-1
I do a lot of freeway driving and I 've tried 2 of these speaker phones with myTreo and the noise cancellation feature is poor . It works fine below 45 mph but the faster I go the more my callers complain about the road noise . Also you have to turn off Bluetooth on the phone when you turn off the speaker phone . The phone thinks it 's still connected to the speaker phone , it will show that it 's not connected to any Bluetooth devise but keeps the phone mic and speaker on mute until Bluetooth is turned off .	-1
We bought two of these based on reviews . Wife did n't like hers at all . Mine on voice dialing recognized every word but the Yes command that actually would initiate the call . So , no voice dialing . People on the other end reported they could not understand me . We returned them .	-1
The first one I got stopped working in about a month later , so Motorola replaced me with supposedly a newer one . New one continues to work but- person on the other side can not hear correctly- lots of static like noises even when fully chargedFor the excellent customer service , I should give 5 stars to Motorola and 1 ( or 0 ) star to this particular product.Update : After this , I tried Plantronics voyager 510 as a BT earpiece . This also had issues ( while better than this Motorola T305 ) , and so I gave up on bluetooth and went for wired in-ear Sennheiser headphones	-1
It is a shame that Motorola build such a great phone , but no driver for it . The Motorola Phone Tool software 4.0 does not support this phone . Go through live Internet update to version 4.35 , still no driver for it . Tried Motorola web site , there is no driver download for this phone . Contacted Motorol support , they say they setup a special support line 800-972-1837 for this KRZR phone . Called that number and opened case with them . Three days later , on the phone with their support engineers and managers for over 10 hours , still could not get the driver.Motorola suggested to pay Verizon to enable the Internet services , then sync the phonebook that way . We are not ready to pay Verizon $ 50 per phone per month to just sync up the phone book.In this Internet age , you would think any technology company would put all their support materials and drivers on the Internet for people to download . Not with Motorola . I guess they afraid LG would look their support material and making better phone than Motorola , so they would rather hide the driver in their grandma 's mattress -- even their own support engineer could not find that driver ... .	-1
These are not good for long term . The phone gets really warm when charging . Instead go with the original chargers . If u can spend 200-300 USD for a phone u can afford an original charger . I stopped using these after couple times .	-1
This charger was one of the cheapest , but was n't worth the savings . In less than a month the product stopped working and upon examination it was clearly fried ! Even the outer plastic looked as though it was melting . Definitely not worth it .	-1
I bought this case for a brother DS-600 mobile scanner as it was advertised to fit that scanner . However , upon receipt I could not fit the scanner into the case as it is about 1/2 inch too short . It is a good quality case , well made and sturdy but they advertise that it will scanners that it clearly can not .	-1
The holster looks nice , seems to be well made and has a strong clip but it 's so tight that when I put the phone in it presses all the buttons on the way in causing all sorts of unwanted things to happen . I have to put the phone in upside down to keep that from happening . When I do it that way it works just fine . Weird .	-1
Still waiting on this product since I ordered it on January 1 2010 ( 3-5 days shipping )	-1
I bought these today at WalMart , and they are terrible . After cutting with a paper trimmer , they were perfect size . Although after VERY careful and slow application , rolling on just a cm at a time , air bubbles would form . I tried rolling the protector on as slow as possible while rubbing from center out with a microfiber cloth . After application , and only rubbing the protector with microfiber , it was scratched past the point of no return . I can not imagine what this screen protector would look like after a few days of use.Although this product may protect the screen , after a couple of days use you probably wo n't be able to see the screen with all the accumulated scratches . The users guide says for best results to replace monthly . After initial application I removed it and threw it away.Waste of money .	-1
use on 2cameras and cell phone . The cutting is fairly straight forward , but the pre-cut edge that is supposed to help with seperating the backing from the protector is not cut well so i 've wasted one sheet as it ripped easily while taking off the backing . material not durable at all . Got scratches just by using the squeegy in the package . Lastly , if you had to reposition it , good luck getting the bubbles ( hazyness ) out . Requires too much effort to get it right . Would not recommand it .	-1
Poorly built phone holder . The & # 34 ; arm & # 34 ; that moves was broken off when i opened the box due to the arm is only attached by the thinest piece of plastic . Slight torque on the arm could easily break it off .	-1
Terrible quality , did n't fit my vents securely . Flopped around when driving..tried to take it off and it broke . Waste of money .	-1
The sticky dash mount broke as I tried to remove it , one of the arms shortly afterwards . Also , it comes with no instructions , have to guess at orientation from the pictures .	-1
Cellet Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Phone Holder with Adjustable Grip not good to buy this product easy broker	-1
the first couple of days that i had it it work fine and after a week it just broke and im not able to use it anymore	-1
I was n't expecting much for the price but at least that it holds my iphone , and it barely squeezes in with a good amount of force , I have a very slim skin cover . Not worth returning but disappointing .	-1
I have a jeep liberty so dont have that much dash board . ( Sticky past kept coming off ) I tried it on car my vent and it does not stay were it comes in handy . Would not recommend this product .	-1
When I pressed the release button , it expanded but would not fit the phone and lock anymore . I opened it and replace the faulty spring . It works now .	-1
They said it was universal mount but it did not fit my Samsung Galaxy 3 ! I returned it and do n't believe I ever received my credit .	-1
I bought this for my Samsung S2 expecting somewhat of a snug fit ( I do n't have a case ) . It fit for the first few weeks , and then the left vent clip decided to snap , along with the adjustable arm . on top of all these issues , the padding was next to useless . Getting a suction cup holder next .	-1
I 've been impressed by the windshield lock-grip of Garmin Nuvi units and even by the effectiveness of a 9-dollar silly-looking gooseneck that not only held my iPod in place but charged it and served as reliable FM transmitter to boot . This latter item item did n't score well with other Amazon customers -- proof that you ca n't always trust the ratings.In the case of this `` Universal Car Vent or Dash Mount Holder , '' you can trust the consumer ratings -- in fact , they may even be a bit high . The device is branded as a `` Cellet '' universal mount in the title , but in the description it 's referred to as a `` Luxmo '' universal mount . No matter . A poorly designed piece of plastic is -- by any name -- a potentially useless piece of plastic.The idea here is that you can , if you choose , unscrew the base and toss it so that it 's not in the way of the bracket , which you then are supposed to insert in any convenient `` vent . '' Unfortunately , my air vents were either too narrow or too wide to accept the bracket , or `` Vent Mount ( non ) solution . '' So it was on to Plan B , the `` Dash Mount '' solution ( at least it 's a versatile little fellow ) . But the base for this kitschy piece of curious clutter is no more than a single square inch . Moreover , I had kept the unit for over a year before deciding to give it a try . So not only was the sticky substance spread over too small a foundation : it was no longer sufficiently sticky to hold in place my iPod Touch even if the surface area were a whole foot ! Here 's where I was spared the worst nemesis of every neophyte -- i.e . making a bad thing worse by trying to make it better . In other words , I was about to get out the Crazy Glue and muck up my otherwise clean dashboard when it struck me that maybe I ought to see if this `` adjustable '' guy actually would clasp my iPod as advertised . Upon pressing the button for releasing the spring and extending the gizmo 's right arm , nothing happened . His right arm was jammed ( and the left is clearly non-adjustable ) . Since he obviously needed a helping hand , I gave him one . Unfortunately , my gentle tugging pressure was enough to snap off that piece of plastic on the right side of this holder with the ( non ) `` Adjustable Grip . `` Mercifully , the experience came to an end before I 'd given this low- ( but over ) priced imposter a chance to show its stuff . But even more fortunately , I can now put this review to rest . May the next buyer have a happier story to tell . As for me , I 'm back to my original clunky and unsightly but effective mount with the gooseneck : GSI Super Quality Wireless Hands-Free 5-in-1 Dock-Mount-Charger-FM Transmitter-Car Kit , with Goose-neck Mount for Ipod , IPhone 4-3G-3GS , MP3 , MP4 , CD , DVD Players - Includes Remote Control , Audio Cable , LCD Display - Cigarette Lighter Plug-In .	-1
It was kinda too small for my phone the advertisement said that it fit the GS3 even after I took the case off it still did n't fit and one of the holders completely broke off ! If you have a GS3 do n't buy this it 's trash	-1
I thought this item was a good idea as it gives you the opportunity to mount your phone closer to the seat instead of up on the windshield . I discovered 2 things:1 ) The unit itself is very cheap . The adjustable arm used to clamp your phone has a major weak spot . Mine broke right out of the package . I made some repairs to strengthen it , but first use showed that this device does not work well with any smart phones . I have an iPhone , and it 's too wide and tall for this device . You ca n't clamp your phone very well because of the cheap design , and the bottom ledge is too small . After 5 minutes of driving , I had to remove my phone before it fell out.This is a good idea that was implemented poorly .	-1
This mount is actually great for the first two days . I used it on the vent and on day two or three after I received it , it would start moving to the sides when I turned . I would have to readjust every time . I used it on a GalaxySII , it was very tight fitting . So DO NOT BUY .	-1
I 'm not very impressed with this . It 's super cheap and fits very loosely on my car air vent . It wiggles around and looks bad as well . I would not recommend .	-1
Terrible Unit . magnet not strong enough for Iphone 4s . Ended up buying a differnt model for 25 bucks that connects to your cd player slot and that one is amazing .	-1
It is too tiny for holding a phone . The metal plate is also too tiny and thick to put between phone and case . Do n't even bother to think about this product .	-1
Mobile service providers claim that this type of antenna does not work , and I have to agree with them . Installing it actually reduced my reception from 2 bars to NO bars ! If you search the internet , you will find that passive antennas like this are no different than that battery compartment sticker that claimed to improve cell phone reception , block radio waves from frying your brain , etc . It does n't work and it 's a waste of money.I recommend buying a wired antenna that directly connects to your phone . If you phone does n't have such a connection , then you may want to look into a different phone because nothing without a direct connection is going to work , and you may want to look into a phone that gets better reception ( there are some -- just read the 3rd party reviews ) .I would n't recommend this product to anyone unless you just have money to burn . If so , please just send it to my PayPal account instead .	-1
Had zero effect . My windows must already allow enough signal through for this to not make a difference . Bought it for the back of my place because I get full bars right outside on the patio , and almost none inside ( I live in a concrete apartment ) . If I put the phone in the same place I had this , I get good reception , but this did n't extend my signal any , or act as a repeater . Did n't seem to help in the car either , but I do n't really need it there .	-1
Does nothing . Did not and any noticeable change . I have used it for some time . The only time it does anything is if it 's on your phone .	-1
There are a few spots around town where my calls get dropped when I use my cellular phone while driving in the car . These areas are very small , only about 300 feet long . And if I hold the phone outside the car when I drive through these areas , the calls do n't drop.I bought this device with the hope that it would allow me to keep calls going without rolling down the windows . Unfortunately , I found absolutely NO difference between calls being dropped with and without this device.When I took the device off , it broke open and I took both sides apart . I did n't find any evidence of components that will inductively couple the antenna and the interior components.However , when it was installed , it did **look** impressive . So , if you want a fake cellular antenna to make your car look `` cool , '' this will fit the bill perfectly . If you want a performance improvement , consider one of the Wilson cellular repeaters instead .	-1
LOOKS GREAT FITS INTO THE DOCK JUST FINE AFTER YOU PULL OUT THE SLEVE . BUT WITH IT ON THE PHONE YOU LOOSE ONE-TWO POWER BARS OR ON-TWO WIFI RINGS . TAKE IT OFF AND THEY 'RE BACK .	-1
I looked over the reviews , I am not sure if I received something else or what ... this case just looked cheap . It broke on the side in no time ... ( have n't even had it 24 hrs ) .I am not sure what the photo is but the one I recv 'd did not look anything like this .	-1
The white turned blue in the pocket of my jeans , which I guess I should have expected , but it took less than a week.The volume buttons were covered , and made it difficult to push them.But , the case protected the phone , and the lip at the front helped protect the screen .	-1
I guess this is what I get form trying to cheap out . I used this piece to connect regular headphones to my xbox 360 , I had to hold the device in place or turn it just right in order for it to work . But as soon as I moved it stopped working again .	-1
the only reason I 'm not rating this item 1 star is I took a gamble to see if it would work with myPanasonic KX-TG6511B- it does n't : /i saw other products that were pricier that were explicit they work and this one wasn'tso if you have a Panasonic cordless phone , you 've been warned !	-1
Be careful to know what you need . The picture shows a 4-conductor 2.5mm to 3.5mm which is what I needed . However , the specs say 3.5 to 2.5 which is what they sent . Also , note that 3-conductor is for stereo headsets . 4-conductor is what you will need if using as a phone headset/microphone .	-1
Bought this because I recently got an LG Octane cell that I love except for the 2.5mm headset plug . I use a wired headset with a boom mic at work due to background noise causing too much interference with the mic on my Bluetooth headset . Headset has 3.5mm plug . Bought this to use the headset with the LG . While I can hear the caller with both ears , the MIC does not work ! I had another adaptor I had used with an earlier LG , and it had the same problem , but hoped this would work based on the ( admittedly vague ) description and a review specifically stating it worked with the Octane . Apparently , that reviewer only wanted it for music , even though that 's not what he stated . Anyway , the same headset worked fine in a Motorola Droid RAZR with a built in 3.5mm jack . I knew this was a crapshoot . I lost . Hope to keep others from repeating my mistake.Also , the adaptor I got is white- the pictures of it vary depending on how you search for it , and change from the item description to the picture in your shopping cart . This is a pretty sketchy listing for Amazon . Was n't sure what I was getting , and did n't get what I expected . Oh , well . Only $ 3 wasted .	-1
Thought my headset for my computer which has a 3.5mm plug would be able to be used by plugging into this converter cable which then would fit my ATT 2 Line office phone . It does not . The price is so low , it would cost me more to send it back than it cost to buy . Bad purchase .	-1
I have owned 2 Plantronics headsets -- The 665 and its predecessor , the 655 . Both have suffered the same fate . The little rubber ear tips are flimsy and keep breaking . When I pick up the headset , the ear tip falls out . I purchased the ear tip replacement pack , which costs about $ 10 and you get 3 ear tips -- 1 small , 1 medium , and 1 large . Given that I only have a need for 1 size , I basically had to pay $ 10 for one ear tip ... which broke after 30 days . The headset sounds pretty good , fits in my ear OK , and people say they can hear me pretty well . Despite all of these positives , I will be replacing it with another brand .	-1
THIS WAS CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP . THEY WORKED FOR A WHILE , AND SLOWLY OVER THE YEAR ALL OF THEM FAILED . I JUST THREW THEM AWAY . THE HUBBY TOLD ME NOT TO BUY THEM , LOL	-1
I select two star because this package was no good at all . My dislike is that I would had paid more to forward it back . Will I recommand this package no . Sometime more mean lease bad purchase on this item .	-1
The battery I received is not new ... I thought I was buying a new battery but instead received a battery that is in no better condition than the one I am replacing . Now to be fair I went back and looked and it does n't actually say `` New '' in the description , but it does n't say `` Used '' either . The picture is of a new battery and describing it as `` Original '' leads people to believe they are receiving a new , original OEM replacement part . This is not the case . I called the customer service number and its an answering machine asking for your name , order number , and detailed description of why you are calling . I somehow get the feeling they get a lot of calls complaining about this so they use this as a screening method . This seller is shady and should not be allowed to sell on Amazon . My recommendation ... DO NOT , UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES , BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER !	-1
OEM battery , but how old is it ? This battery holds a charge , but for a shorter time than I expected .	-1
Not much to say here . Got it out of the box . Paired easily . Worked a few times and then would no longer change the volume on the headset . I suspect a short . Regardless , it 's not saying much for a product when it stops working after less than two weeks and barely an hours worth of usage . I wonder if Motorola just does n't make a good product anymore . It sure would be great to have a working headset .	-1
I gave up trying to use this Headphone with my HTC TytnII PDA phone in my pants ' pocket . It has so much interference , that the audio is on-and-off every 2 seconds . Useless.However it works with my computer , at very close range.All other bluetooth devices I tried with my phone have worked perfectly . This one does n't . The range probably gets reduced due to the audio being stereo ... ? ? ? ? ( just gessing ) .	-1
I purchased the Motorola S9 about 2 months ago , and it worked fine for about 1 month . Then the buttons stopped working consistently , and finally stopped working all together . I got agreement from Motorola to replace the headset under warranty a month ago , and shipped it back and still not headset . When I called I got the typical call center garbage , putting me on hold , disconnecting the call , etc . Finally I got someone on the line and they claimed that the headset is out of stock and that is why I did not receive it yet . They never notified me of this , and when I asked when it would be in stock I was told they did not know , but I could call back in a week . I told them that was not going to be OK , and then they claimed to have resubmitted my order and I would receive it in a week . We shall see ... Do not buy this headset , many people have had trouble with the buttons and customer service has been terrible getting this remedied .	-1
Bought these @ Target when they first went on clearance from $ 100 to their current Amazon price.I 'm a runner , so these were mainly used for running with an iPod Classic . it was really nice not having to worry about a cord bouncing up/down while running . the reception was/is wonderful.Since i purchased these about a year ago , i 've moved on from an iPod to an HTC Evo & also use this headphone for work.here are my thoughts -- in simple and quick format.Pros:1 ) bluetooth pairs easily with Evo==after initial pairing , the phone will remember the device and activate its connection on each startup of bluetooth ( with headphones being turned on ) 2 ) signal distance==i 've gone from my desk , where my phone rests , to the Bailer about 30 yards away and still have a strong signal . to anyone saying `` you must keep it in line of sight and in your front pocket '' -- you 're not using it right . or you got a defective unit . mine works in a warehouse , through boxes and pallets and steel beams.Cons:1 ) uncomfortable==OH MY GOSH my ears kill after 10 minutes of using them . Good Lord i ca n't stress this enough . i 'm not a small man , and i 'm not stretching these out -- but i 've had to remove one side from my ears just so its not like my head is in a vice grip.2 ) Design of buttons==buttons are on the vertical band which raises upward from the earbuds towards the arch that goes over the ears . that means everytime you go to switch a song , change the volume , or press Play -- you 're pressing a small nub of plastic forward which digs into the arch of your inner ear and feels like someone 's twisting it with needle nose pliers . this has to be the most annoying aspect of these headphones.to explain : any time you press your index fingers against your ear to block out sounds -- you 're pressing against a small flap of skin/cartiledge . this small flap of skin/cartiledge is bent forward/outward whenever you change volume/track & literally causes a headache every time.solutions : possibly smaller ear buds ? i 'm looking into it . but for the time being -- i have to make due with what i 've got.for the price -- they 're awesome . as a runner -- they do n't short-out when you sweat on them . they 're really adequate when you DO N'T press the buttons.i give this product 2 of 5 stars+1 star for easy ability to pair+1 star for signal strength-2 star for uncomfortability ( really , they 're that uncomfortable ) -1 star for design in placement of buttons	-1
O.K. , O.K. , I know there are numerous reviews here that warn that these headphones fail if you sweat on them , but I decided to try them anyways . If you want to use these for workouts , do not ignore the warnings - go buy something else.I received them yesterday , paired them to my blackberry , and headed out to the gym . They worked great for about 30 minutes , then the left speaker and all controls on the left side ( volume up , down , and phone buttons ) ceased to work . I was definitely sweating , but come on they do n't even last 30 minutes ? ? ? Sent them back to Amazon this morning . Maybe I 'll try the Jaybirds next-	-1
Looks great . Charges easily . Love that it 's moisture resistant which is perfect for running and doing a lot of walking in various weather as I do . Also my sweat wo n't ruin it.BIG CON : Very , very twitchy in keeping connected to the phone . Basically if it 's not in your back pocket , it 's going to cut out a lot if you move your head too much , etc . I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket , but that does n't work so well with this headset . Also , you ca n't very well sit down with your phone in your back pocket either ( and then it does n't connect well either because you are sitting on the phone ) . So really only works well if you are standing up and it 's in your back pocket . All other uses are only so-so.Wish I had n't bought it .	-1
Pros : good pairing and consistent stream . Decent sound although not loud enough.Cons : very uncomfortable fit ( my ears hurt just after an hour of having them on ) , lots of background noise , sound does n't get loud enough in pulic busy places , extremely annoying when you wear any jacket since you keep feeling it catch.Bottom line : Do n't buy it ! The participles for a good device is there but they need to improve on the design and make a lot more comfortable before people can start enjoy using it .	-1
I have had my S9 for about 2 months now . I love it for the gym . Problem is the up volume button stopped functioning . After doing some online research , this appears to be a relatively wide spread problem and it appears that Motorola has not fixed the problem in the newer S9-HD unit . Same problems being reported . Good headset when the buttons are working properly but I would not buy another one .	-1
I was excited to rip the package open to put my trusted Otterbox on my new galaxy s5 . Frankly , that 's where the excitement stops . The plastic two piece holder which you place your phone in does n't connect tightly , feels real loose over the phone before placing it in the rubber outside protection price . Once inside the remaining rubber piece the volume buttons do n't line up properly nor does the power button . The strip at the bottom of the case that 's right below the home button is to high basically making you disable the fingerprint scanning portion of the phone . I believe Otterbox released this case just a little to soon before working the bugs out . I 'm using the pelican brand case until Otterbox works the kinks out .	-1
UPDATE : You will drop your phone using this case and I never dropped my phone before . It 's very slick with no grip on the edges . Thankfully did n't damage the phone , which displays the HTC ONE 's superior build quality as it was dropped on hard ceramic tile from 36 '' counter height . Like I said before the clear plastic will and DOES scratch really easily.I did like that you could barely tell that my phone had a case on it and literally had compliments on that fact , but the risk of damage is too great for me.Just reinstalled the stock smoked ( color ca n't display the awesome brushed aluminum on back ) TPU case for now to protect it.ORIGINAL REVIEW : It does fit snug and snaps into place , but very limited edge coverage so wo n't protect like it should . Feels like it would snap/slip off the edge if dropped , not protecting the phone like it should . Polished hard plastic not the TPU rubber/plastic style so it will scratch easier on the back .	-1
Only looking for scratch protection from the back of the phone . It does n't hide the beauty of the phone and hardly adds bulk at all.Mine is completely void of any logos . The picture showed that the boxwave logo was on the back of the case , but mine arrived without . Just how I would 've wanted it.If you are n't prone to dropping your phone , this case is perfect . Well done boxwaveUpdate***After a couple days of using the case , I have found it very uncomfortable . The top and bottom of the case is not rounded . It 's almost sharp . It 's uncomfortable on the fingers . I switched back to my other case	-1
I purchased this for a trip to Hawaii so I could listen to Pandora on my phone while hanging out on the beach . It absolutely did not work . I tried it when my phone was fully charged and the phone battery still drained . Not worth the purchase and I wish I could get my money back . Oh well .	-1
I know it 's only $ 4.50 , but this is a piece of garbage that is so outdated ( made in 2007 ) that it should be in a museum . First , it comes with no tips . When I ordered it , I thought it would have something other than the base unit . I have n't used it because I refuse to invest more money in this ... it is so old that it probably wo n't work with my Galaxy S3 and if it does , it would probably not be able to power it much.I bought it out of desperation when Hurricane Sandy hit . I regret buying this and wasting my money ... .. P U R E -- G A R B A G E !	-1
Cellet is garbage . I had two of their brand cases and both broke soon after buying them . They claim leather but it is really faux leather aka . plastic and its faux leather is the thickness of a dollar store Condom .	-1
I purchased this item from WIRELESS UNLIMITED in Texas . Although it is being sold as a new OEM Blackberry battery , allegedly the same as what comes with one 's Blackberry , I do n't think it is . Why ? First of all , my Blackberry is only 4 months old , and its original battery is marked `` Made in Japan . '' While this battery at first glance has the same label ( quite easy to fake , of course ) , it is actually marked `` Made in China . '' Another subtle difference is that the OEM battery that came with my Blackberry listed its milliamps ( if I recall , 1400 mA ) . This battery has no designation at all of its amp rating . Now considering that the real thing costs $ 40- $ 50 at most cellular retail stores , and this item was one-seventh the price , what can I expect ? Still , there is the little matter of false advertising ... they are calling this genuine OEM . The `` made in China '' label , the lack of a retail package ( it arrived in a little plastic pouch , unmarked ) , and most importantly , the inferior performance , all suggest FRAUD . Also -- they charged me [ ... ] shipping and handling even though it was sent 1st class in a tiny envelope at a cost of about [ ... ] at most . I would not trust this seller again .	-1
You get what you pay for . The price seemed to good to be true and it was . The battery did n't last at all and I had to return it immediately .	-1
the batter died and then yo uahve to buy and solder a new one in there . REALLY ! or thow it out and buy a new one for 200.they say they dont make the CS70N anylonger so you have to buy a whole new unit . Terrible design.im on the phone a good part of the day and should have known better to not buy a more expensive unit.do yourself a favor and call the manufacturer first and ask about stuff like battery life , how to replace . I would have not purchased this if I had know it woudl last only a year or two .	-1
If mounted anywhere near your radio , which is often the case , it will completely kill your reception , FM or AM . Even with nothing plugged into it . Makes this worthless to me . Avoid.They need to better shield this !	-1
The unit puts out so much RF interference it kills all radio stations and also kills FM traffic alerts on the Garmin . When unplugged all my radios return to normal . It may be due to my car set up . 1998 Honda Accord . 1 12volt plug under the radio . This may be too close . You may have better results .	-1
Buying these headphones was a terrible mistake . The sound is flat and lifeless and the volume controls do nothing . I bought these to use with my Palm Pre . I do n't know if the problem is Pre related , the Pre 's bluetooth stack has a lot of deficiencies , or if these are just lousy headphones . Either way the combination of the Pre and these headphones is not a good one , Palm Pre owners should avoid these . I have a cheap pair of wired headphones that have an order of magnitude better sound when used with my Pre .	-1
The sound quality is good WHEN it works . Although easy to pair with Blue Tooth to the iPhone once I did it and tried it again at the gym I ca n't get the music to play and of course you probably already know the controls on the Sony Headset do n't control the iPod/iphone ? I thought it was really cool at first but after trying to get it to work at the gym for three days running it goes back . It is also worth mentioning that you ca n't use regular rechargeable batteries . It has a built in Sony battery that you have to use its own specific charger for . Oh goodie , something else to recharge and keep up with . Not worth the headaches .	-1
The microphone on the headset is overly sensitive . So sensitive , that my peer can not hear me while I walk from a relatively quiet street - background noises cover my speech , making the headset useless .	-1
my wife and i have both had IGO equipment and although the idea is good , the parts are kind of pricey and the power units failed ( died ) in 1 year or less for both of us . still , i like the concept .	-1
I found every piece of the iGo to be inferior quality and not worth the money . I have it all in a box and should toss it as I would n't resell something that worked so poorly and was iffy at best to work .	-1
THis works well , but is not sturdy . This is the 4th or 5th case that has broken , just by catchinig on seat belt , etc . My husband likes this model , but we will probably find a different kind .	-1
As the title says . The reception of the product is great but the earloop keeps falling off . You can not wear it comfortablly while wearing sunshades .	-1
This does not charge all of the items it fits . But when it does work it is nice to have .	-1
Finally gave up on all their products as the connectors are always iffy . Would n't recommend an iGo items . I have several that are in a box . I wo n't even re sell them .	-1
The headset was purchased to pair with the new Storm , it was terrible , muffled on the called side and sounded like a tunnel on the caller side . Tried several different phones , landline , other cell out of area codes and even international , same result . So if your pairing it with the Blackberry Storm do n't bother.I returned it and replaced it with the BlueAnt Z9i and what a amazing difference , clear as a bell at both ends of the call , great noise cancelling and seems to pair with no problems , also can pair with 5 devices at once and can switch to the called phone.Hope this helps someone .	-1
Worked fine until it stopped working . I Could hear ok but all the other person could hear was a faint voice . Four months usage . Wo n't buy another of this brand .	-1
I purchased this product based on a CNET recommendation . CNET has been a reliable source for most of my technology purchases . This however , was a disappointment . The unit does not eliminate sound effectively , volume controls are `` mushy , '' the microphone/on off switch will not stay retracted , resulting in a constantly discharging battery . It did pair easily , and the voice activated controls worked well . I would not purchase another , and would advise others to avoid this model .	-1
I purchased this after reading the positive reviews . I should have paid more attention to some of the negative reviews that talked about the microphone wand that acts as an on/off switch.I used it a total of about 6 times and the `` wand '' refuses to go back . The mechanism that allows it to retract is not working and as a result its always on.When I went to Amazon to return it , it would not let me return saying the last date to return had just passed and there is some vague language about partial credit etc.So I opened a warranty ticket with BlueAnt . Let 's see how that works.I am disappointed that Amazon does not clearly explain what to do with products that go defective after a month .	-1
They dont send you the one in the picture . The end that plugs into the ( whatever ) -pod is much larger . It wont fit with some cases . Not really a problem for me but buyer beware . Also the plug that goes into the ( whatever ) -pod is made of plastic instead of metal . The whole cord seems cheep but it at 2 bucks for 3 of them its not a bad deal .	-1
Not good . Cable is super thin and cheap . Retracting mechanism broke after like 3 pulls .	-1
not happy with this purchase , although this case is roomy , and you can definately fit a phone with a case in it . The pouch part is also made ruggedly . But the belt clip expanded on the first day and i could n't get it to tighten back up .	-1
Do n't buy It . I have been wearing it one month and already de area of the belt is cracked . I liked the shape , model , for my S4 with zerolemon super battery . but as I said do n't last if you use it each day .	-1
I bought this case despite some negative reviews due to needing stuff ASAP as Sprint was shipping me my new S4 and i dread not having everything i need right away..I am using this case for a Samsung S4 with a Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 5200mAh Extended Battery + Black Back Cover ( Compatible With ALL Samsung Galaxy S 4 Models ) [ 18 Month Warranty ] **NOW WITH NFC / Google Wallet** and the Hyperion Samsung Galaxy S4 Extended Battery HoneyComb Matte TPU Case / Cover for the enlarged battery and Door . This case performed great for 2 weeks , then the GLUE just stopped holding the seams together for all stress points on the case . I bought mine from DeCi Accessories . I can not recommend this case .	-1
Stitching coming out after only a handful of occasional uses . The stitching at the bottom of the belt clip strap is coming out -- about half out now , after only a few uses over the past two months . Otherwise the model seemed perfect for carrying a Motorola Droid Razor M. I had written a positive review after the first week , that review has been pulled .	-1
Someone , somewhere has a dark sense of humor . After ordering a CA-100 cable and waiting for the Brown Truck of Happiness to arrive , I discovered that inside the Amazon box was a sealed package festooned with Nokia logo and `` CA-100 '' model designation . The back of the package says `` Nokia Original Accessories '' too . Inside the sealed box is a Nokia branded CA-101D cable . What this means is that instead of the CA-100 cable that has a USB connector on one end , and a Nokia 2mm connector on the other , I ended up with a cable that has a micro-USB connector on one end . So ... No joy . For a $ 6 cable I 'm not going to burn gasoline and time returning it . I can always use this cable with my other devices . However , I can not recommend this vendor at all .	-1
I 've tried several of these cell phone signal boosters , and I have to say , not one of them is worth a dime . Do they boost your cell signal ? Maybe ... a little ... .sort of ... not really . Yes , the bars on my Sprint phone do jump a tad when I turn this on , but it 's barely noticeable and certainly not worth the exorbitant price . This one just feels like tech snake-oil . No , moving to different locations made no difference . Nothing did . This thing is just a placebo . Do n't bother .	-1
The unit I received contained no instructions ; no problem go online to company site to get them . Easy to install put the unit near window or anywhere you have service ( at least one bar ) then put the antenna at least ten feet away . The antenna cable is only 20 ' so it is difficult to go further than that unless you are going to have cable in front of you , then the next problem is that you can not have the cell phone near the unit so in my 15 ' x 12 ' office I could not move the unit and antenna around so that I could get a green light as you also have to have phone within 6 ' of antenna . Gave up after an hour of moving all over only to get a green light for a few moments then back to red . Did nothing to improve signal since I could not get a green light , presumably this would have indicated that I have a signal that my cell phone then would pickup . I may try the other four person Sprint device the company has ?	-1
I ordered 3 of them , 2 of them came without an issue , but the 1 that had problem , it got very very difficult to get it replaced , the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly , at Jabra website , after entering all the info as per requested , they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email ( no phone # ) , and I 've asked for an exchange and again , they replied to ask me to do the same process again , it 's never ending . Bad customer service .	-1
This stylus was used for two days and the mesh surrounding the tip began separating . At this point it is usable but not reliable . I will not purchase this item again . I also bought the Trent Limir Dual purpose stylus and it is working quite well .	-1
This one is not accurate . I have compared it against several high quality meters at work , and the 4460 is always off , but often by a different direction or a different amount.I miss the display in amps the older model had . It was very useful for determining circuit loads in cases where an amp clamp was not convenient.It also hogs both outlets of a standard duplex receptacle , so the other one is covered and unusable . ( Yes , a pigtail would help ) I e mailed the company twice about the inaccuracy and inconsistency , and did not receive a reply.It became more and more inaccurate and finally died .	-1
UPDATE : The display has failed completely on this product . While the buttons 'beep ' , the readout is blank . What a POS . Now back to my initial review.I placed a 5000 BTU ceramic heater on this device to see actual usage . The device showed around 11 amps constant pull , but I left it plugged in overnight while the heater ran . Several hours later when I checked the Kill A Watt again , it was warm , and its receptacle had deformed around the plug , making it impossible to remove.This device is supposed to have a NEMA-rated outlet capable of 15 A draw . This is what customers use a Kill-A-Watt for , to monitor real time use . Clearly this one could not handle prolonged use , and I wonder if I was sold a gray-market product .	-1
doesnt stay clipped to my belt , falls off easy . hard to get my blackberry out . Would n't recommend this product . took way to long to get .	-1
I got this on the recommendation of a friend . After speaking with him while he was using this headset , which was crystal clear , I asked my buddy what kind of headset he was using . He told me this one . So I picked this up on Amazon.I used it with a Sprint Sanyo phone and the performance was terrible . I lived with it since I knew I was going to upgrade soon . I upgraded my phone to a iphone with AT & T ; , it was even worse . Turns out my buddy was using a Samsung phone . We think that this works great coupled with a Samsung phone but it seems to dislike other brands . In the end , it ended up getting washed in a pair of my pants and did n't work any more . Good riddance ! I picked up a Plantronics headset and have not looked back !	-1
I tried two of them . Both would not hold a charge . I hated the charger . It has to be in the case to charge . The company I ordered from said & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; but it was clearly not in both instances . I 'm still searching for an & # 34 ; in ear & # 34 ; model that works .	-1
Maybe I was a bit harsh in the title , but I had to put something out there that would grab your attention . I want to save you the trouble that none of these other reviews did for myself . Most of the reviews were great so I bought it . I have to say the sound is pretty decent , very similar if not slightly worse than my wep200 . The wep410 looks very stylish , but it just does n't FIT RIGHT IN THE EAR . It feels like it is going to fall out and it does n't sit at the angle where it is pointing from your ear to your cheek , which is what the wep200 does . When it sits at the angle it is NOTICEABLY flaring outwards . It looks like it is sticking out of your cheek at a 30-40 Degree angle , which looks extremely odd . I tried all three different sized earbuds , but no luck with any of them . I can get it to fit in my ear , but the fit of the earbuds is VERY poor . I even got my father to try this headset to see if I had deformed ear canals , but they also did n't fit him right . I really wish I could return this , but since I have opened it I ca n't . Sadly , I had to give the headset to my father . ( He does n't care how poor the fit is as long as he can use it for hands free calling in the car ) Bottom line is that you SHOULD NOT buy this headset , but you should buy the Samsung Wep200 . That Headset is excellent for the price and very light in weight That headset is also the one you want if you like ear buds like myself . I do n't like big bulky `` Android '' looking Blue tooth sets that take up a bunch of room .	-1
I paid about $ 90 for this . It would not stay in my ear . I tried every ear adapter every way possible . It fell out of my ear every time . I was lucky this happened in my car most of the time , and I was able to find it . Finally it fell out somewhere and I lost it . I do n't think I got 4 days use out of it . Do you want to feel totally ripped off ? Get this product , pay a lot of money for it and watch it disappear.It is worse than that . Is comes with a junk plastic case , that is useless for storing the charger and other stuff . If you pay this much money for something , they should provide a nice case for storing it and the charger , manual , and shorty cable . the little box they provide does not hold together . So you will need a new case for it right away . All these little bits and pieces are guaranteed to be scattered and lost.Also , my first charger failed . I discovered this by plugging it into my computer using the USB connection . Jabra gave me all sorts of headaches to get a new one . It took several messages where they asked for a serial number . Try to find that ? I could n't . Then after exchanging several email over a stupid charger they told me I had to remove the rubber earpiece to find the serial number . I could n't read it -- it was too small to read.So if want to blow a fuse in anger . Get this . Have an Aneurism , stroke , or headache and get treated like C $ % P by there customer service .	-1
The over-the-ear piece is a not a good fit for my ears . Moreover , they are extremely fragile and prone to breaking . Within 5 minutes of getting the phone out of the box , I broke the ear piece just trying to get the headset over my ear . I put the headset in my piece and bent the second piece . The plastic piece covering the control buttons seemed very cheap also , and I think it would be a matter of time before that broke as well . I generally take good care of my headsets and electronic equipment , so if the headset seemed fragile to me , it probably will for most . Also , as a woman with a small head , the headset just felt clumsy and big . On the upside , the acoustics seemed decent , but then I only used the headset once and decided to return it .	-1
[ Good ] Decent battery life.Decent looksFits somewhat comfortably [ Bad ] You 'll sound great to the person you 're speaking with . Unfortunately you wo n't be able to hear the person that you called.Not worth the price	-1
I am pleased with the sound quality of the device . Volume level is adequate even when on noisy roads and people on the other end have actually remarked positively about the level of quality . I only wish the Jawbone engineers had stopped tinkering when they perfected the audio quality and not designed a fit system so complicated and brittle that it impairs my ability to actually use the device.The ear loop has about the consistency ( and strength ) of a paper clip . The result is something so flimsy that Jawbone Inc. considers earloops to be a consumable . After receiving the Jawbone as a gift this holiday season I was unable to use it as all of the included earloops snapped off within the first day of use . Needless to say I did n't start using the product until about February after waiting for customer service to send me replacements . Any future earloops , they tell me , will have to be purchased for $ 2.50 each ! The sound is great but like others on here the fit leaves something to be desired . This after trying the infinite combinations of earloops and earbuds the unit comes with . Turning my head quickly often requires a readjustment even with the tightest fitting earloop . I realize that all ears are different but I 've had cheap headsets that fit great because the engineers did not try to over-engineer the fit process.I am sure there are other great sounding bluetooth devices in this price range that are better constructed and will provide less aggravation . It 's for that reason I ca n't recommend this product since its construction makes it completely unreliable .	-1
The sound quality is really very good , far better than the Jawbone 2 . I did have the ear insert plastic break , requiring glueing . The thing that I despise about this headset is the earloops and how easily they break . You can bend them maybe a dozen times before they fatigue . Aliph has been pretty good about sending out free loops , but I am on my third pair of free ones . I just broke a new one after a week , and I was super careful to not bend it ! I am going to ditch this and try the Blueant , as I am sick of handling this bluetooth headset with kid gloves .	-1
Ok , me and my partner wanted this Jawbone because of their advertising of noise canceling so we ordered 2 . Once they arrived we put them on the charger . One Jawbone broke before even first use : after the battery was fully charged half of the Jawbone came off with the charger when we tried to disconnect it - horrible charger connection . So , we sent one back for replacement . I started using the other one that 's left . The Jawbone connected ok to my Motorola Q but when my phone rings the headset did not ; i press the answer button - nothing ; I press the answer button on the phone and phone works like there is no BT headset connected . Tried this with 4 different phone same result . So , the next day we sent the second one for replacement.A week later two new headsets arrived . We charged them , connected to the phones and ... both are malfunctioning again . On one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything . Tried on 4 phones - the same . We sent it for replacement . The second Jawbone had such loud statick and cracking in the audio that we sent the other back the next day.A week later two new headsets arrived . One would not connect to any phone . Second had the same cracking noise . We tried to call Aliph , the manufacturer ( no toll free number available for support ) for 4 days , left numerous messages - no one ever returned not one call . Sent them numerous email messages - nothing back.So , I would highly recommend to stay away from this very undeveloped product . The idea is great , they just need to complete their testing phase as this product is still in very early testing .	-1
I wish I could report a positive review of this headset . What little I was able to use of it , it seemed fine . However , it rests at the bottom of a trash can beside me , in the hotel I am in , after removing the charging cord for JUST THE THIRD TIME . The first two times it was difficult , and I could tell it was going to be a problem . So , yesterday , I found a video on YouTude that showed how to properly remove the charging cord without damaging the headset . I am sure the video was correct , but it did not help . Perhaps the headset was too damaged from the first two removals.Either way , I do n't need a product that requires I be so delicate with it , perfomring an operation that I would need to do at least 3 times a week.I am obviously not sayng that you can ; t purchase this product and have a happy relationship with it . But you can NOT take the removal of the charging cord from the headset lightly , and I just do not need to be burdened with this . I want to detach and GO - not spend 3 minutes sweating the removal.Headset might be good , but I 'll not be recommending these and I 'll not be inclined to buy another Aliph product again .	-1
Proper fitment very hard , i purchased ear jells with it and still had a hard time . Everyone i spoke with on this headset had nothing but complaints with static , and said i sounded muffled and had a very hard understanding me . My side sounded pretty good , but had to keep volume at max . I was using it with a Verizon GZ one so that possibly was an issue do n't know if anyone else has had this problem .	-1
The Jawbone bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for . Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made . It looks metal but really is cheap bendy plastic material.Further , once you set it up , you can only use it on one ear . Other headsets ( like Plantronics ones for example ) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear . The Jawbone does n't do this.While the Jawbone 's noise cancellation does seem good that 's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled , soft and digital-like . Further , the Jawbone is too big and bulky to comfortably put it into a pocket to take with you.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible . They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer . But , my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it , they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website . If I bought from some other retailer , it has ZERO warranty ! I 'm not sure whether or not this is even legal since I 'm not a lawyer , but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they do n't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph .	-1
.This outdated model only charges at a 500mA rate . That 's fine for clamshell phones , but it 's half-speed for iPhone or any smartphone . I did not test it with iPad , which needs 2000mA for full-speed charging.- - - Alternatives - - -- Anker Dual USB 3.6 Amp Car Charger-PowerGen Dual USB 3.1 Amp Car Charger	-1
I must have read more than 30 % of the reviews on Amazon about the product . Nonetheless I decided to ignore the iphone 4 users that complained about not working and thus relaying on the product description . Alas , that was an awful choice . After connecting it and displaying the charging symbol about 2 minutes later it warned me the device does not support charging . I tried 3 more times and every time it kept dropping so I decided to leave it as such , even worse the battery seemed to have turned hot . It does charge other usb devices but it failed to deliver the purpose of its purchase : charge my iPhone 4 .	-1
out of the box it smells like cheap plastic and burning electronics ... I 'm afraid to plug this thing up to my iphone 4s ... This thing is super cheap , as in thin metal alloy , poorly molded plastics , it does n't even have a UL certification ... I 'm guessing this cost less than 50 cents a unit to manufacture and it shows unfortunately ... on a plus side the box it came in looked nice	-1
Product looks solidly built . The plastic feels velvety smooth . The N85 does n't charge on this but that 's a Nokia issue , not USB device issue . The ipod touch 2nd Gen charges , tho . So it works.I thought it was going to be too high for my VW jetta since it sticks straight up but there 's enough space there to stick whatever you want to charge.Product works ! Mygearstore shipped it quickly . Not as fast as the Prime 2 day but it was fast enough.UPDATED Jan2012 : After 2 years , the product just stopped working . Green light would flicker in/out . Threw it out .	-1
stopped working . on top of that it works then stoppes working every 10 seconds . makes phone go haywire . broke my ford mustang 's power slot because the prongs are too heavy duty and large it pulled the slot out . Do not buy . Buy Motorola micro use charger . Good .	-1
The package on this product is misleading . On the package you will find an American flag . But in the fine print it reads `` Engineered in the USA '' , `` Manufactured in China '' .If you 're boycotting China , read the packaging .	-1
If you are planning on using this to charge smartphones , be very weary . This charger splits the total 1 amp output between the two usb ports . This means that each port will get at max 500 milliamps . This is not enough for most smartphones today . When using the GPS on my palm pre , my phone will actually LOSE battery life with this charger `` charging '' the phone . I gave it to my wife to charge her regular phone which works just fine .	-1
You are left eared . The 90 degree turn to fit the ear bud turns the wrogn way so it pops off too easily . The sound form this device is decent , but not worth the price for all the hassel of putting this on my ear and taking it off again . Also the earbud kept falling off when not in use . Poor design . I purchased this because it had so many good reviews , which is why I 'm writting this one.Great sound if you can keep it on your ear and keep it from falling apart on you . So for me it was a total waste of my money .	-1
This headset works pretty well with good noise canceling , but it wo n't stay attached to my ear so the part that rests on my face loses contact . At most it will stay on my head for 10 minutes . I find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place . The second one I got ( the first was missing parts ) came apart when I tried to unplug it from the charging cable . Jawbone does not seem to offer any other buds ( not even spares ) so I just ordered some Acoustibuds in the hope that I can actually use it . If they do n't work I will try a hack I saw with a Jabra eargels product - that involves cutting up the supplied earbuds and gluing the eargels to the locking piece . I will update this review once I get it to work ( or not )	-1
the leather wrap on the belt clip has worn out . now the metal belt clip shows and the worn out leather pieces are unmanageable . now I 'm looking for a new one . otherwise the case was quite functional .	-1
Like the clean sleek look but did n't last it broke in 4 weeks will not buy again ...	-1
The iPhone really needs a horizontal case like this one . It 's a bit long and wearing it on your hip vertically makes it uncomfortable and unwieldy when you sit down . Whereas a vertical case eliminated this problem . In terms of looks , I feel horizontal and vertical both look equally as cool but a horizontal case is a lot more convenient , at least to me.This DLO case is nicely made and seems durable but unfortunetly , there is a flaw in the design : the exposed open parts can make your iPhone very vunerable to scratches . I noticed a fairly deep scratch on the back of my iPhone right where the middle opening on this case is . It could have happened from a zipper , metal button or most probably from a rivet on my jeans coming in contact with the back of the iPhone through the slot . I am switching to another case that covers more of the iPhone.Just a side note about rubber iPhone cases : I do n't like the feel of the rubber cases at all-they feel weird in the hand . And the rubber cases tend to stretch out over time and this lets in dust and grit which can scratch the iPhone . Also Apple recommends you not charge the iPhone will in a rubber case because the heat will not be able to dissipate . This means you have to keep taking it out of the rubber case and putting it back in every time you charge . You can see that these types of cases are less than ideal .	-1
I wish i can give this a negative star ! ! ! the day it came i plugged it in the car and to my phone and it worked great for a few min . i then unplugged it and threw it in the glove box for a few days and when i when i go to use it - it no longer worked after a few days of sitting in my glove box . terrible .	-1
I bought three of this charger , the first was more than a year ago and it was good but I lost it so I ordered another two.I expected a much faster charging rate with the 950mAh . It charged my Samsung S III from 3 % to 14 % in around 22 minutes ! Very slow !	-1
I have used three of these , and they worked well for about 5 or 6 months , but then died for really no reason . one lasted longer , but the connection became loose , and if not in the exact spot , it wont work . I would think these could last for at least 1 year or so , but guess not . good price , but maybe that 's why ...	-1
The charger worked great at first , but after 5 months of use it died ! Light still comes on but it wo n't charge anything . Of course the return period ended after 30 days , so I guess I 'm out of luck .	-1
I 've had this charger for over a year , it gets very light use and it stopped working . What happens is the microUSB connector does n't make good contact and we have to wiggle and finagle the cable to get it to work and even then it only works for a few seconds , until you hit a bump and the cable vibrates and loses its connection . I 've had the same issue with mini usb to micro usb adapters from Motorola - bought half a dozen of them and none of them work reliably . I wo n't buy a motorolla micro usb connector again . The media bridge cables are the best , they feel like they click in when you connect them , very solid . Motorola ? Not so much .	-1
Used this in my car . While it was working , it was great . Nice big blue light to let you know it 's plugged in . Some of the other chargers have tiny lights that are only visible from one side . this big transparent power indicator light can be seen from both sides.The design of the charger is great . It 's just WAY too fragile . The plug had issues 5 weeks after I got it , so now I 'm looking for another one ( but obviously , not a Motorola ) .I 'm disappointed , I thought a Motorola product would last longer .	-1
I do n't know what the deal is with all of the great reviews.I 've been using this in an Infiniti with a Galaxy S2 for the last few months , but now when I connect it , it just DRAINS MY BATTERY . It does nothing except steal power . Most of the time the phone wo n't synch with the charger , but when I do get that little sound that means it 's synching , it wo n't charge.What a waste - are we expected to just buy a new one of these every few months ? It 's a car charger -- it sits in my console , out of sight , barely touched most of the time . How is it that it just stops working ? I have two other chargers in my house that I just abuse on a regular basis moving them around , coiling them up , changing outlets where I connect them , and I 've been getting steady use out of them for nearly two years ! Mighty Motorola ca n't make a car charger that lasts longer than a cheap , no-name flea market usb charger ? I am disappoint ...	-1
This charger worked well for a few months and then stopped working . Keep in mind that the blue light can be very distracting when driving at night . I connected it to the port on the back of the arm rest to minimize the light 's distraction .	-1
Fast charging , short lived . Died 8 months after getting it . It 's likely I was sold the knockoff version you see mentioned in some pics , but it did charge VERY FAST .	-1
Great price and it seems to be working for a lot of people.But.. with GPS turned on , HTC Sensation and Samsung Galaxy S 4G either stayed at current charge or very slowly gained a little . I stopped using it after a few weeks . I will have to look for a charger with a faster recharge rate ( amps ? )	-1
This has nothing to do with whether or not it 's a cheap knock off , my primary beef with this charger , after living with it for over a couple of years , is the BRIGHT BLUE light it gives off . At night it 's hard to ignore it , it 's too bright and distracting when driving .	-1
MICRO versus Mini USB is the warning here . If you see this sizing and understand it , then it 's good for your cell phone . NOT mine with REGULAR mini USB . Not a complaint about the product , just the confusion about the size terminology . We have passed these two items to folks who DO have MICRO USB phones to use in their autos .	-1
It work great when it did . It only worked for a month then it would charge my phone anymore . Do not buy .	-1
My original review was `` best mobile charger I 've owned '' . I even bought one for my girlfriend after she saw mine . Now , in less than 3 months , both are failing . It starts with a poor connection at the phone where you have to wiggle it or place it in a certain position to charge and devolves into not being able to charge at all . Mine is a complete loss and hers is on the way out . If I just had one and it failed I would n't give such a poor rating , but both failing together lets you know there is an inherent flaw in the design . I 've very disappointed because it was an excellent charger during the brief time it worked .	-1
Product stopped working after only 4 months.Amazon referred me to Motorola for the 1 year manufacturer warranty.After calling Motorola 6 different times ( of course an India call center ) and even more emails ( all not responded to ) I was told that the product is out of stock and they tried to send me a wall charger as a replacement . They did n't understand that the product that I was executing the warranty for was a car charger.Still not resolved .	-1
Is not for the iPhone 5 this should be fixed in the search criteria . I have no use for this and will not spend my money to send it back . Thought the brand was good and to my surprise does not fit my phone .	-1
does n't work with Samsung S3 ... it stops charging every few seconds ... will try to send back , and now for a few more words ... no it still does n't work	-1
Merchant claimed to have mailed the item , but it never arrived . Rather than resending another , merchant finally agreed to a refund . This is a good one to stay away from , although he did finally refund my money , so I guess he gets a couple of points for that . I would think that a reputable merchant would have suggested a replacement option , but none was offered to me .	-1
This is a very nice charger , but it does not fit my iphone 4 like it said it would . I am dissapointed .	-1
I only used this a handful of times before the connector was n't making a strong connection to the phone any longer . When that happens , my phone will charge only if I hold the cable to the phone and everything is aligned perfectly . Otherwise , as the car hits bumps , it might charge for a minute and then not charge for a minute . And yes , it 's the cable and not the phone . This is one of the problems with buying an integrated charger/cable unit ... when the cable connector goes bad , the charger becomes useless . And it does appear to be a genuine Motorola product .	-1
This worked for awhile , maybe 3 months . Then it stopped . What kind of review do you give something that works well for three months but then stops working ? How about one star ?	-1
My charger came in bulk packaging . I 've always been leery of chargers that come this way . It 's a big risk plugging my S3 into a device that could potentially be a knock off . But here 's my beef , the bulk packing was not stated anywhere in the description . What if this was to be a gift ? I purchased the charger directly from the Amazon store so there 's really no excuse for this .	-1
Even though it was an OE charger I do n't know if it was a charger or a Droid X problem but the phone sometimes would not charge on this even though the light was on . It was independent of which car I was in whether it worked or not . I got rid of the Droid X and got a new Moto X and use the new charger that came with it and do n't have any problems with it .	-1
I have a Samsung galaxy 2 Skyrocket and was looking for a rapid charger since the one I had quit working . I knew this was the same micro-USB power Adapter as my Samsung , but everytime I plug this in my phone it seems to open up the accuweather app and plus I have my digital clock on my lock screen set to display on top and it puts it on the bottom of my lock screen . In order to put it back on top I have to turn off the phone and thats what this charger does n't do . It automatically reboots it instead of turning it off completely . I know that 's not a bad thing but I like it to turn off completely . The only cool thing is the blue Motorola emblem lights up in the middle to indicate it 's on . Gon na try to find my old charger and buy that when I find it . I 'm assuming that the electronics in this charger is geared toward Motorola only .	-1
Does not last long ! All of a sudden , stops charging . This is the second one I have bought , thinking it was a fluke with the first . Not recommended , unfortunately .	-1
If i could give this 0 stars i would . This item arrived in a plastic sandwich bag . It did not charge my phone . Sent it back . Bought a verizon charger that works great . Would not recommend this item .	-1
I ordered two and the first two did not work at all , I got two more and of these one was only spotty at best and the other got super hot when it was plugged in . I have in and went to the the Verision store and bought one that actually works .	-1
This one died in 3 weeks using it with my new Samsung Nexus ! ! ! Wow , expected it to last longer ... Little upset ...	-1
Now after not four months its trash , does not charge any longer . I contacted seller and they said , sorry you had a 30 day window to send back . Ever hear of a 30 day warranty ? Garbage . Guess you get what you pay for .	-1
I ordered several of these at the same time and they have all had the same fate . The micro usb plug at the end fails prematurely and the blue Motorola light on the end of the adapter is obnoxiously bright . I was so bothered by the light on the adapter that I painted it black , but then the usb plug broke again just a few weeks later . I 'm throwing it away and looking elsewhere .	-1
No excuse for this . It worked for about 9 months , and its like many things where the hassle to replace is less than return .	-1
I 've had 2 of these , they work for a few months , then they gradually stop working . Plus , the blue light is kind of cool at first , but when you 're driving at night , it 's too bright and distracting .	-1
This is a cheap knock off . Do n't buy it . I was expecting one , like the one that came with my phone.The picture is inaccurate .	-1
I bought this to replace an older charger . This thing barely provides a one to one charge . If my phone is plugged into it and I 'm using it , it loses power . If I 'm not using it , it barely adds one percent power per 15 minutes . Looks good , that 's about it .	-1
This product does NOT fit any Motorola phone . It is not made for any that are flip phones . It can only be used in the newer style .	-1
I do n't know if I 'm doing something wrong but this wo n't charge my Droid Incredible . I took a five hour drive but when I unplugged the phone , the battery was completely discharged and the phone was very hot to the touch .	-1
These work great , when they work . Mine never went bad , but I left it plugged in all the time . My girlfriend however had gone through 2 in 6 months . She unplugs hers daily . They do not withstand much movement .	-1
This isnt a micro usb chager it is a regular usb charger and they send a cheap adapter for a micro usb port that falls off and is really long waste of money it says nextel on it instead of Motorola dont buy !	-1
The plug on this particular charger is very flimsy . It will break if you bend it or plug in the phone and pull on the phone too hard . I bought two , one still works .	-1
Worked great at first- charged my Droid Bionic quickly without any issues . After a period of time ( 6 months or so ) the cord starts bending at a weird angle and will not charge the phone unless you hold it perfectly still ( almost impossible in a moving car ) . I have 2 of the same exact chargers and both suffered from the same defect . Would rather pay more for a higher quality one than to have to replace it every 6 months .	-1
does not work with new smartphones . my smartphone said when i plugged it in that this doesnt work with it and its would be slow to charge . do not get for modern smartphones .	-1
I purchased this based on the high review ratings on Amazon . I do n't like this charger . it charges way too slow to the point that I can not run my phones GPS on it and keep the current charge , so how can it possibly charge the phone when the phone is in use ? I actually lost battery life while running the phone GPS with the charger plugged in . Bottom line is that this charger does n't have enough voltage to charge the phone . I never had a problem with my previous charger that broke after 2 years . I tried charging my phone on the way to church ( a 30 minute drive ) without any apps running and it only increased the battery life by 5 % . for the record I have a Motorola Photon 4g . I have since purchased the New Trent Arcadia RapiduoNew Trent Arcadia Rapiduo ( 1PC ) 10W 5V/2A Dual Port high-speed USB car charger w/ Free Full Speed Micro-USB Charging Cable ( IMP80C ) from Amazon because that charger is supposed to charge at higher speed . I will write a review on that after trying it a few times .	-1
They stopped working after exactly 9 months . I bought them because of the good reviews . Very Disappointed in the quality of this product .	-1
This charger did not work right out of package , it was a gift . The price was great . Just found out they could n't use it , so I took back to try to return . Amazon said it is past return for full refund.Otherwise I am very happy with Amazon .	-1
I found this headset very comfortable , with excellent audio quality , the few times it successfully connected to my Nokia phones.After working with BlueAnt tech support and trying it on two different phones , they admitted that they have a known issue with Symbian OS phones ( most Nokia and some other smartphones ) where the headset can be `` paired '' with the phone , but it does not connect reliably for incoming or outgoing calls . Phrases used by the tech included : '' [ We ] have n't got around the compatibility issues with Symbian phones . `` `` [ this is a ] known issue . `` and apparently there is a significant amount of discussion on the BlueAnt support boards ( which he could not find during our call ) .NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SYMBIAN OWNERS as much as I would like to !	-1
The unit came and right out of the box it had a rattling noise inside . I would 've kept it but was bothering me when driving and I need to turn my head left and right.Also I noticed that it did n't work pretty good while paired with two mobile phones simultaneously.It is pretty small and it feels extremely comfortable , I wish it would 've worked properly .	-1
Although it 's hard to tell from the fuzzy closeup , these DO NOT have split rings , but bent rings . IMO , bent rings are in no way strong enough for a cell phone , camera , or mp3 player . A good example of split rings : [ ... ] I will attempt to salvage these straps by adding real split rings . Good thing I have a magnifying lamp .	-1
It appears in the photo that these might be sturdy items to keep your flash/thumb drives in one handy place . Nothing 's further from the truth . The & # 34 ; thread & # 34 ; is not much thicker than what you 'd use to sew buttons with and the ring that you are led to believe will hold several items is barely 1/3 & # 34 ; in diameter . Furthermore , if you actually put a thumb drive on the ring , you 'd need a pair of needle nose pliers to spread the ring apart , then forcefully close it back together . Yes , they are cheap and yes , there are several in the pack . But at over $ 8.00 in shipping ( they come from Singapore ) , you can probably fashion a better thumb drive holder by using parts of old key chains . This is by far the worst purchase I 've ever experienced on Amazon ... who should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trashy junk.The jokes on me ... I fell for the hype . Do n't let that happen to you .	-1
First of all , I paid 78 cents for 10 of these . Shipping and all ! I would NEVER trust them to hold the weight of my cell phone . The string is about as thick as fishing line . The ring is about 1/4 inch in diameter . The loop is only big enough to put three fingers thru them . This was a bad investment but for 78 cents I ca n't complain too much . I just CAN NOT recommend them nor will I ever use them . There are far better lanyards out there and for not much extra money . DO N'T BUY THESE ! !	-1
I chose this rating because the product never came . I dislike that they were no help in getting me this product . I recommend that no one else buy from this person because you will receive no item . It 's hard to rate the quality of something that does not exist . : (	-1
i travel a lot and carry too many chargers ... so , i though the callpod was a great idea.i ordered the charger and 4 adapters for $ 109 bucks ... the deliver was ontime.what arrived was a really cheap plastic pod and adapters that at most should not cost more than $ 2 bucks each ... the adapters are so cheaply made that they do n't attach to the pod very good . the charger has all these lights that stay on unless i unplug the entire unit . the ipod charger is so badly made that it got stuck in my ipod ... i had to spend serveral minutes trying to jiggle it out ... i believe the side buttons which actuate the clip in inop ... i called cellpod and they said to send it back ... i said no ... they sent a defective adapter and they should pay the postage ... then ... they tried to convince me to go to dhl and use their account ... i said no ... i paid for deliver to my house and i 'm not running around town looking for dhl ... finally ... after haggling with c/s , they said they would send a prepaid dhl envelope to my home ... all in all ... this is really a cheesy product and not very good customer service ... i have not received the dhl envelope after a week ... i will never buy from them again ... nor will i recommend their products to my fellow travellers ...	-1
I hate the fact I wasted money on this product . After 2 days I had 1 hour of battery life . I had to keep it on charger just to have juice for maybe 1 conversation , its not comfortable , and its flimsy . Dont waste your money .	-1
I went through two of these . They are great . However , considering I had to go through 2 of them in the past 3 months , I would say the build quality is garbage ... at least in the plastic near the speaker . That plastic will just snap with normal use . I 've never had this problem with any other headphone . It does sound great though .	-1
I had read about this same problem in a review before I bought these but I thought it was just a fluke . I had mine for a little over a month and the plastic that holds the right speaker on broke rendering the headset useless . It looks like I can return them and I would replace with another but I do n't want to keep replacing them because of a design flaw.Sound quality WAS great for music . These are good if you want music headset that you can answer a phone call if you have to . But if you intend on talking on the phone with much any back ground noise this might not be the one .	-1
I am not happy with the quality of the product and chip looking material ; however it fits the price . I wish it was a little bigger too so the phone could easily comes out specially when using the protector cover . Also I could not easily turn off the phone when can not answer . It is not easy to use the clip on belt or purse , too tight ; however , I like the two sim-card keeper slot for international traveling use .	-1
Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either ! Not worth spending money on this guy ! Not worth spending time on this guy either !	-1
This cord is ok to charge a ipod not an iphone will be to scnog to power it up .	-1
Iphone is a complete rip off , and most people I know that have one do n't even know why they got it oter than being able to say `` hey I got an Iphone '' . The thing is a IPOD touch with very basic phone functions ... ..more over priced garbage from crapple made to rake in apple fanboys money ... ..and they fall for it .	-1
I got this sim card as a free promo item with the purchase of a cell phone , the rates for this service are really nuts , I probably wo n't use it .	-1
I 've always just bought an international phone card when I 've traveled but decided to take my own phone this one time and try one of these sim cards . Well , let me tell you . I made about 45 minuets of calls during a total of 3 weeks and my overall bill was $ 176 . So , if you do the math , I could have spend about $ 13 American dollars on a 10 euro calling card with 400 minuets and called from the hotel or any public phone ... .or $ 176 for less than an hour of calls . This was certainly the worse choice I made for my trip and I advise you to NOT buy this ! Amazon.com , please consider taking this off your list of products ... it is very misleading and cost consumers way too much money after it is purchased .	-1
Read the other reviews carefully . Those ranking it `` high '' may not be well-informed about all options -and there ARE comparatively INEXPENSIVE , easily available options ! You 'll need an unlocked quad-band phone ( available in all price ranges - sometimes buying one at destination can be competitive re price but not always ) plus your own regular service SIM , pre-authorized for international use ( call your carrier before you go ) to use `` just in case '' until you decide which service to use wherever you 're headed . Even at a dollar or two per min for a `` just in case '' call , YOUR OWN service will , for those few calls until you get a local SIM , be cheaper . ( Or you can always text-message/SMS , cheaper YET , even on your own SIM ! ) Also pack a good pre-paid international phone card , too , as back-up ( amt depending how long you 'll be gone and how many countries you 're jaunting off to - you can recharge this , too ) so you can call home from something other than your cell ( which can also get pricy ) .On arrival , purchase a local-provider SIM w/appropriate features for you ( kiosks , local cell ph provider stores ) , and add some initial funds to it . Install or ask them to do so . Then buy pre-paid `` recharge '' cards as needed ; not high-priced . I found them even in E Europe ( every country ) and Turkey - yes , higher per min than a contract , but a TINY percentage of the cost of Mobal or your own cell ph ! Take a few minutes on-line and explore regarding this - you will be very glad you did.I hope Amazon withdraws this from their offerings , I truly do .	-1
It 's convenient , but the charges are astronomical . Even if you only use it for a handful of minutes , you 'd be better off purchasing a prepaid card in whatever country you have traveled to . Be warned , Mobal is a ripoff .	-1
I chose this card even though it had mediocre reviews because it was the only one I could find that charged by use , not a prepaid amount . I went to europe and never used the card/phone and was charged for 3 text messages that I never got . For $ 2.40 I did n't fight the error very hard but the fact remains I was charged for services not rendered . Further , they were were after me for the $ 2.40 before I even got back from the 8 day trip . ( emails when I got home were already in my inbox ) Its not the money , its the principle , I do n't like disingenuous companies . For a lousy $ 2.40 they should have just said sorry and written it off . I would have used the card on future trips but its in the trash now .	-1
I bought this item after i forgot to add it to my unlocked phone purchase and it was a waste because you can not use this sim without giving your credit card , which means that even if you only want incoming calls you still need to register . The plan and pricing are not clear.Also , the phone number is in the UK and i was expecting it to be in the US .	-1
I bought the card and took it on an international trip . I put the card into my phoneand went to the site to activate it , and it said to put in 19-20 numbers , but therewere about 30 numbers and letters on the sim card . It was worthless .	-1
I charged up the battery and use my phone for just under one hour . The next morning I wanted to place a call and the charge did n't hold . I replaced with the older battery and it has worked very well . I will not order from OEM again .	-1
This battery was purchased for my Motorola RIZR Z3 . I believe the battery is a Motorola battery but certainly not brand new . It does n't keep a charge nearly as long as the original battery when the phone was 1st purchased . I suspect this battery is probably refurbished or was defective when made and did n't pass the new battery test and that 's the reason it 's being sold at a knock-off price . However , definitely does not work like a new battery .	-1
This product has all the signs of a genuine Nokia battery , but after the first week it seemed to always lose its charge and get extremely warm during moderate usage . My previous Nokia E71 battery lasted nearly three years , and just got weak . This one seems weak AND gets VERY warm to the touch . I have n't checked , but I suspect its voltage output is low and causes a higher amperage draw .	-1
it works well with the phone the clip to hold onto the ear is not aero dynamic and the ear bud does fit well into the ear canal	-1
I was pretty disappointed in this . First , it 's not very sturdy and did n't last very long before it was broken after being held in my pocket when I 'd go out . It did n't really matter , though , because I did n't miss it ; the audio and A2DP quality were both pretty disappointing , so I just got a new , better one and did n't feel too bad about it .	-1
I got this for 31 dollars once . I dont know why it went down so much . The one I got might have not been compatible with my phone ( which was an LG Env2 ) But this works well otherwise that is , until im using it ! It frequently disconnects during calls while on the phone for 15 minutes ( sometimes it happens almost right away . No matter how close I am to the phone ( which doesnt make sense because its fullly charged and supposed to last at least 5 hrs ) I mean the no matter how good anything else is ( sound , mic , etc , product build , features ) it all depends on how stable its connectivity is to the phone ! I know alot of others gave good reviews on this but after reading about what many others have to say about the way this disconnects alot , I dont doubt it . Ive had other bluetooth headsets and none of them ever had this problem . The volume doesnt get that high for music , and the sound can be a little tinny at times . I will be looking elsewhere for bluetooth headsets. Got ta have one that stays connected . Thats a must .	-1
I have another Plantronics Blue tooth headset for calls . It works fine.I mainly ordered this after reading the reviews for my iPhone , to do both - answer calls and listen to an `` acceptable '' level of bluetooth music.a ) The bluetooth music is BAD . Sound is tinnyb ) I use this while walking ( not running , just walking ) . The music skips for every step I takec ) The stereo headset uses a proprietary connector , so you ca n't use any other earphonesd ) the connector doubles as an earloop . Although they give you other earloops for changing out , that only works for the mono earbud . If you use the stereo headphone you are stuck with this single earloop.e ) Comes with so-called usb charger , but the usb connector is proprietary , non standard . This means you can not use any of the zillions of standard usb cables/connectors you ( i ) have lying aroundI would have returned this immediately , except that only `` non-opened '' items can be returned.Choose some other product , this one certainly does not work	-1
Worked great with iphone3 and NZ-409 but does not work with iphone4 ... No updates available so useless ... Moving to NZ-500 unit with built in bluetooth and iphone4 certification ... .	-1
It was probably right there in the manual all along ... this thing is about the equivalent of a bluetooth earpiece except that it stops the music ... if you have a friend that has a stereo that imports the contact list , dials from the screen , etc . They do not have a NX409 or NZ409 ... the screen does n't even know the phone is there until a call comes through . Do n't even think about the possibility of putting your phone away and seeing the name come up on the screen.Not really sure that $ 78 + installation + where do I put the wired microphone = worth not having to wear an earpiece.Bluetooth music ? I guess that could be useful if Pandora worked better on my phone , but it is much easier just to stick your mp3s on a usb stick or ipod.I 'm about ready to put it on Craigslist and take my loss now . : (	-1
I have this hooked up to a clarion head unit so no issues with compatibility however , for the price I do n't get this item at all- it 's voice quality is terrible , the controls have n't worked for any phone or mp3 player I 've tried and the interface is both unintuitive and intrusive all at the same time.The unit uses BOTH of your RCA auxillary inputs plus a 12v switched source . It 's easy to hook up but you 'll need an adapter if your headunit does n't have free RCA inputs . There 's no provision for bridging or adding to an existing RCA input device . The cord provided seems to be long enough but when you actually get to threading it around the dash bits of your car it 's not long enough to reach up into the roof lining or sun visors where the mic could adequately pick up your voice . The mic is horrible- the noise suppression basically does n't work and you 'll sound like you 're in a tin can regardless of how loud you turn this up . Fortunately , on the output side the unit works well and includes a switch which lets you route signal to your left or right car speakers . It does n't seem to have a provision to route it to both so you 're likely to have to turn up your stereo quite loud to hear the other person.The controls do n't work for my android phone or my wifes nor with my daughter 's nokia so do n't think you 'll be able to answer or hang up with the interface on the mic unit . It also does n't seem to control any digital music players we 've tried . The unit only works for one bluetooth device at a time so if it 's hooked up to a passenger 's phone or computer you wo n't be able to use it for your phone . Also , it has to be paired whenever you switch bluetooth devices ; it does n't seem to remember units it 's paired with previously.The head unit has an incredibly bright blue led that 's so obnoxious I 've had to face the unit against the headliner to prevent it from being distracting at night . The led will literally light up the inside of your car ; it 's that bright and blinking . You ca n't turn it off or change the color- it just blinks and annoys.So , for this rather amazingly high price you get a unit which does n't work very well at it 's basic tasks ( picking up speech , playing music or letting you listen to callers ) and does n't have any special features- like multiple pairing , memory or a connection which allows you to have other auxillary devices on your headunit . Basically- I see it as a bust . I have it and I use it but I would n't buy another one and I 'll tend to steer clear of any clarion headunit which needs to use this thing .	-1
The Plantronics Explorer 220 Bluetooth headset is cheap , light , and easy to pair with a cell phone . That 's about it.Unfortunately , there are a lot more negative things with this unit that keeps me from recommending it.-the transmission is weak ( sometimes the person on the other line can not hear me , and vice versa ) , -often times drops the bluetooth connection , -there are unwanted noise ( humming , clicking , etc . ) through the earpiece-the ear hook hurts my ear , no matter which side I use it-sometimes it `` accidentally '' turns on when in my pocket ( when the button gets slightly pressed , it turns on ) and I run out of battery juice in the middle of a callI 've gone through three of these units from three different sources , and they all have the same problems . So it is not an issue of just getting a bad item at one time.Overall , I can not recommend it . I gave it two stars because I do not usually talk on the phone for more than a minute at a time , and this is sufficient half of the time.I 've resorted to an older bluetooth headset , theMotorola HS850 Bluetooth Headset ( Color Sent Based on Availability . Comes in Black , Blue and Grey , or Silver ) [ Bulk Packaged ] . I know when it is on/off when the microphone boom is out/in . The soft rubber ear hook is gentler to my sensitive ear , and I 've never had a problem with poor signal or dropped connections .	-1
I went through three wired headsets ( I like earbuds for wearing with ski and bike helmets ) - lost one and had two fall apart on me , so I went to this product . But I am not impressed with this product - I ca n't get the earpiece to stay in my ear , except by twisting the ear loop and jamming the ear bud into my ear - it HURTS after just a few minutes of my 30 minute commute , or , if it is n't hurting me , it falls off and hits the ground or gets lost under my car seat . The volume does n't go high enough while I 'm driving so I ca n't hear over the car noise ( yes , I have a brand new , fairly quiet car ) Anyway , I 'm debating returning it due to the discomfort factor .	-1
I know there is always a risk when buying generic , cheap , made in China , stuff like this , but Ive actually had pretty good luck with other cheap car charges like this . For the price , I figured , Id buy a couple of spares in case one died.I ordered 3 of these and while the retracting mechanism seems to work very well , two of the three simply did not work . I tried it in two different cars on two different phones . In both cases , the red LED lit up , so it cant be a fuse issue , but neither phones indicated that it was receiving a charge when these chargers were connected.The third one does work , but only intermittently . If I connect it , and leave the cord fully retracted , it does not charge . However , if I pull out the cord almost all of the way , it seems to make the connection and charge the phone.I know I could probably return these , but for how cheap they are , its not worth the hassle to package them up and pay for return shipping .	-1
I purchased a bunch of these since my Girlfriend tends to destroy them on a regular basis regardless of the build quality . I had bought similar chargers before that did OK . These ones however did n't work even right out of the packaging or stopped working after a few uses . I only have one left that works about half the time .	-1
The micro USB side of the cable could never establish a reliable connection with any device I attached it to , and this past week it stopped working all together . I 've owned this item for well under a year ; way too soon for a cable to stop working.I advise looking at a different company .	-1
I bought this phone in March 2008 like many other reviewers who wanted a PDA and phone combination . While it looks great and does have a slide out keyboard , this phone has serious issues . I agree with many here , it is slow as Hell . If you needed help or have an emergency , your are out of luck . It takes forever to boot up . Of course , leaving it on drains the battery big time . I had my phone synced to my computer and bought a few apps for it and this slowed it down even further . It got so bad , I had to completely reset the device , wiping out all my info . I stopped syncing it and had to ditch some apps I really liked because the Tilt had issues with them . The Internet looks horrible on this phone , it is slow even with a 3G connection and I do n't bother with the Wi-Fi . I wo n't play music on it . Call quality is also not great . I use a Jabra bluetooth which makes calls sound much better and clearer than the phone itself . The lag time for opening anything is far too long . It takes what seems like an eternity for the Windows Mobile system to open apps up . I had used Motorolas , ( hated those ) , Nokia ( loved them ) and this was the first HTC phone I have tried . It will be my last . I have an iPod Touch which I love and now want an iPhone . The Touch is easier to use than this . The Tilt is too overpiced for how it ( does not ) perform . While it has a lot of features , getting to them and using them wastes time that you are supposed to be saving . If I had known then what I know now , I would have never have bought this phone . It only gets 2 stars because of the screen keyboard and Office Mobile apps included . I was extremely disappointed in how this phone operates . If you are thinking of purchasing this phone , DO N'T Bother , there are better phones out there.I am going to revise my review to note a few things about how this phone works . After having tried a new Nokia N96 and its annoying menus and buttons , I actually found myself missing some features of the Tilt . The Tilt will allow you to directly access features by both screen touch and stylus . Connections to the Internet may be slow , but it will use the best option available without bugging you . The Internet does not look as good as it does on an iPod Touch or an iPhone . The buttons on the face do light up and are easy to see quickly and the keyboard is helpful . Navigation is better than I orginally thought . It is not enough to change my rating or suggest purchasing it unless you really want a PDA more than a phone . The Tilt does have strong PDA features , but it does run under the Windows Mobile interface . Apple has it beat with the Touch and the iPhone .	-1
first off , the rating is 1-star only because i ca n't leave it at 0. i got this phone over the iphone because of the lack of MMS and QWERTY keypad on the iphone . boy , that was a HUGE mistake . when i initially bought the phone , i had it for only a week and a half when major bugs started showing up . the keypad text only shows up half of the time and it was taking literally 10 minutes to open programs . no joke . then , it started freezing so badly that the only way to shut it off was to remove the battery . during this time frame , i had not downloaded anything that could have disrupted the phone in any way . needless to say , i returned this phone and got a replacement.the replacement phone was great ... for a month and a half . that 's when all the issues from the first phone started happening again . with this phone , i refrained from downloading anything , period . all i can say is that this phone sucks big-time .	-1
This product merits a 1-star due to the fact that Amazon censors well-cited reviews that point out the deep flaws of this 'iPhone killer'.It 's nice it has a faster cpu now , but the fancy Qualcomm integration with ATI video hardware actually now PREVENTS the video acceleration from being used , unlike the predecessors , because either nobody can legally , or be capable to ( Qualcomm ) , implement drivers , nor afford to ( HTC ) . It 's like getting a nice , fast Nvidia video card and then running the computer in Safe Mode.The phone can actually take decent pictures , if you can get pass the sluggish , skippy , blurring display that reminisces of FIRST GEN digicams , as well as the resolution reducing glare from the non-removable lens cover.Heat is an issue where the device can almost burn your hand when 3G and WiFi are both on although it 's nice the display does n't distort because of it , and the battery does n't explode.Windows Mobile , as an OS , is n't that great and still is n't that great on this hardware . It multitasks TOO WELL so you can end up having sluggish response when running apps because something in the background starts chugging the CPU . Then because its graphics APIs ( such as DirectX Mobile ) rely on hardware acceleration , and there is NONE on this phone , screen redraws are sandwich making time , almost.Think of this more as a PDA that has phone features , than as a phone with nice PIM features . Compared to even Palm 's extremely outdated OS , the software OS on this phone runs like a sloth and lacks any of the polish Apple SHIPS with its phone.It is nice this phone does allow you to flash new ROMs to get past some of the limited features that ship with it ( although no video acceleration fixes ) , and that it is a WORLD TRAVELER so you can take this phone and use from Japan , to Europe , to everywhere that uses WCDMA and GSM , except for T-Mobile's/Emobile 's 1700MHz 3G network.Unlike what Ace Wireless of Gardena will tell you , WCDMA 3G allows you to do voice and data simultaneously .	-1
I 'll be quick . Good idea here , poor engineering . When it works it 's wonderful , but it hits snags way too often . I upgraded software as per customer service , it did n't help much.GPS is great when it works , but too often fails.Bluetooth stereo is great when it works , but too often it fails and devices have to be reset/repaired.I have to reboot an average of 4 times per week.One solid plus , the cell signal has been outstanding for me . I can get a connection and complete a call when my friends can't.If the next iPhone has GPS I will probably eBay my Tilt .	-1
I 've tweaked mine and added 3rd party programs , but you ca n't get around the fact that it 's pretty darn hard to make a simple phone call without the stylus , and it 's especially frustrating to use the keypad for call options ( e.g . voice mail ) once your call is connected . This just plain sucks.Basic phone call operations turn into a two handed procedure , pretty dangerous when you 're on the road.After 5 months with this phone , I 'm really missing a phone that has a keypad . I 've gone back to my Nokia 73 and will continue shopping for a better Windows Mobile device ...	-1
I actually never used it but here is why . When I finally got the package it was folded in half with tire marks all over it . Like the mail man folded it , laid in on the street , backed up right on top of it , and proceeded to power brake and burn out on top of it . needless to say the screen had unfixable creases and was barely still in the wrapper.it might be a good protector and it really probably had absolutely nothing to do with the seller but I was pretty steamed .	-1
I ordered this because the Microsoft one is super over-priced , but in the end , it just would have been better to get the Microsoft one . ( or better yet use HDMI if that is an option ) The overall build feels cheap , and looks cheap , but that does n't always mean it is cheap , this time however , it did . It works , I 'll give it that , and it even came with a nifty little adapter/extender for the Audio cable , but the image is in triplicate , the main image in the middle , then a ghosted image on both sides . It is n't so bad that you could n't play but it definitely gets annoying super fast . Just bite the bullet and get the Microsoft one , or get a new monitor for Christmas that has HDMI input like I did .	-1
Bought this to connect my speakers to my TV . Its ok , I guess for $ 4.50 now you can not expect much , but I dont expect it to last . The cord is really thin . I have to make sure I use minimum bending radiuses or else I feel like I will snap it in half.I also seem to get some 60hz hum if I leave any of the extra cord laying around behind my TV . and the associated power cords.First cord got sucked up into the vacuum and is longer usable . Ordered another and the metal connector just broke off . Looking for a different item this time .	-1
This looked like a great deal . I have a boombox with a 1/8 & # 34 ; ( 3.5 mm ) input for external audio sources which I wanted to use for my tablet computer and a couple of other portable devices . All I got was distorted mono sound or stereo sound with a 60 cycle hum depending on how far in I pushed the plug . Pushing it all the way in only produced hum . Tried it on a number of devices . Same results . My guess is that the internal wires are not connected at the right spots in the plugs . I bought a shorter , more expensive cable that works . Buyer beware .	-1
They worked ok for about an hour , then starting making clicking noises and cutting in and out on my headphones . Must be a very shoddy product if it ca n't even work for a full day- I returned them .	-1
I bought this cable 4 months back . I noticed few days back it is playing only one side of speakers . Not working for stereo . Only one side at a time . Even tough I used this cable very rarely for my Creative speakers.Now I will look for another cable .	-1
Kept this in my car and it worked well for 2 or 3 uses then just stopped working . Replacement cable worked well so was n't my car . Not happy with the quality of this product .	-1
This ear piece have a weak reception , it do n't filter out sounds very well , this is a very poor product disappointed .	-1
This bluetooth is NOT woth buying . It hurts your ear so bad that you will have to take it out often . The voice quality is NOT good and the person voice drops out often . The battery is also very bad . It does NOT last long at all even on a full charge . I will never buy another Motorola bluetooth again !	-1
I needed a new headset ( my BlueAnt is so small and light I constantly lose it ) . Sennheiser figured out easy-to-use answers to what are the biggest drawbacks of most headset designs : noise canceling , switching the mic from side to side , and the buttons ( on/off , call , volume ) . Kind of a `` DUH ! '' simplistic design . BUT : * The outer plastics used in the construction are VERY CHEAP . I pulled it out to use a couple weeks ago and found it shattered in pieces . It had n't been run over by the car , or sat upon , or dropped . I 've since made several attempts to SuperGlue it back together . * Should the battery run down while in use it shuts me out of my call ( LG phone ) . * Sometimes the ready/in use light will go on , but I am unable to get the earpiece to respond. > SIGH & lt ; After trying many different makes and models over the years ( Sennheiser , BlueAnt , Cardo , Motorola , Ericksson , Jabra , Plantronics ) , I 'm sticking with Plantronics for all future purchases . I had the Voyager 510 for years until I wore it out . I 'm set to buy another . Plantronics , to me , is the gold standard in bluetooth technology .	-1
I do not have a Galaxy Note , I was just looking for a really large case . I have a work and person phone that I need to carry at all times so I was looking for something big enough to hold both . I found this and thought it looked great , and it definitely did look it when I got it . However after a couple weeks I can tell its not.First I ordered this product and received it the next day , thats impressive since its from a third party shipper not amazon.The the way its made did n't work well for me . There is so much velcro on the front its a bit crazy , no case needs that much . I wound up removing the velcro from the front because it made too much noise , and just was n't doing anything . I left the small parts on the other side of the stitches which is plenty.Not after a couple weeks the fabric on the back is pulling away . If you look on the picture you can see the metal clip is on a peice of fabric which is then sewn onto the main part . That part is already separating . I dont expect this to last me more than 3 months tops .	-1
I picked this up to use with my Galaxy Note 3 and simply have not been that pleased with it . Everyone has their opinions and I am just not crazy about it , but it does hold the phone well .	-1
Purchased the pouch for the Galaxy note II . Very roomy , holds Note II plus cover.The design is great . Draw back to this case is the belt clip which started to tear off after about a week of use . Material for belt loop and clip could be made stronger . This is why I 'm giving only two stars .	-1
Poorly designed . I wo n't use it because I worry about losing my phone.I have a Samsung Galaxy Note II and was looking for a vertical holster . It 's a large phone and awkward to carry on your person . I tried a horizontal holster which was just too big ( it was designed for a phone with an Otterbox ) .I have a plastic protective case ( not a large one ) on my phone so I was happy when I got this one and my phone fit perfectly . Not too loose that the phone shakes around . However , the clip sits right in the middle of the holster , so when you are wearing this , the whole thing is top-heavy ... the top of the holster leans away from your body , making it very easy to bump it with your arm or bump it against something causing the holster to unclip from your clothing.It 's probably fine if you wear a belt ( I do n't ) and can slip the holster through that , but the design of holster makes wearing this phone on your person awkward.Disappointed and still looking for the perfect holster .	-1
I had high hopes for this but was let down hard . It sounded like I was inside a tin can . I tried it with the Noise Shield on and off but no difference . The caller on the other end did n't notice that effect but the removal of background noise for them was no better than my favorite , the Plantronics Voyager 510 . The other big issue was the fit . The ear loop is slightly spring loaded to keep the mouthpiece sensor pressing against your cheek . This is intended to allow the sensor to differentiate between your voice and the background sounds . The problem was that the spring tension of the ear loop was slightly pushing the headset off my ear . It comes with several ear bud sizes and two ear loop sizes . I tried them all , on both ears . No luck . It was held on so loosely that the slightest lean of my head to that side and off it came . Completely unacceptable and far worse than all the others I 've tried . I have tested 8 different headsets . The way I do my tests is to pair two headsets , put one in each ear , and then switch between them while on the same call . Even if I ignore the fit problem ( a deal breaker for me ) the sound quality was poor . Worse for me than the caller but why bother , I 'll stick with my 510 .	-1
It never fit right in my ear even though it comes with different rubber ear inserts.Everyone always complained they could n't hear me.I , at best , could hear the other person very slightly . I tried it for a day and returned it .	-1
The sound quality was the worst I have ever heard from any earbuds I have experienced.However , the volume was so much louder than other earbuds , I think the problem is that of a speaker being used at the wrong impedance.These may be set for a much lower ( 6-8Ohms ) impedance and when played from an Iphone , the volume goes up but the sound quality goes OUT .	-1
has the lowest quality i have ever seen.i purchased the cheapest i got it .	-1
I bought this bluetooth after using another model of Plantronics bluetooth to death . I liked it a lot but it was a little bulky so I went for a slimmer model this time ; the Explorer 330 . FORGET IT ! It wo n't stay in my ear . It makes my ear so sore that I can hardly force myself to wear it ( I have to have it for my job ) and if I get four feet away from my cell , I get static . I 'm VERY disappointed with this model and will be returning it .	-1
I got this for my wife . It worked for a few months , then it simply would n't come on anymore . We have no idea why . Save your money and get a better quality headset . That 's just my opinion ,	-1
I was overall quite happy with this mount . It stuck to the windshield well . It held my device well . It was quite adjustable ( allowing both landscape and portrait mode and easy changing between them ) .But after only 6 months , the ball joint failed and could no longer support any weight . This meant that my phone screen just flopped downwards and pointed at the floor ( in any orientation ) . After trying to deal with this , I finally had to remove it from my vehicle because it was causing dangerous driving conditions and it was better to just hold the phone in my hand than to deal with the defective mount.Good design , but poor quality materials or build quality .	-1
I bought this item on eBay ( refurbished , brand new but out of box ) - and it is just amazing . WiFi , Camera , Video ( you need to upgrade the firmware ) and a full keyboard - what a great phone.Very small issues - sometimes the network cuts out ( AT & T ; 's problem **EDIT : no it 's not -- it 's a problem with unlocked phones picking up signals from multiple carriers ! ** ) , no mainstream IM client , no way to check email or use IM over WiFi and the browser needs work . I 'm sure BB will fix these issues with later phones.The buttons are a little small ( I have fingers like sausages ) but I 've learned to type using my thumbs nonetheless.Add an 8GB MicroSD card and you 're in business ! I do n't need an MP3 player anymore ! To reiterate , find the phone unlocked if you can . Mine says T-Mobile when it starts up , but since it 's unlocked I just pop in my AT & T ; card and it works fine . **EDIT : Unlocked phones might not work . After two years of dropped calls , the phone shutting off by itself and listening to other people 's phone calls , I 'll stick to provider phones from now on .	-1
Cozip case is simply just a case ! ! It can only protect the iphones BACK thats it.Cozip case does not protect the phone from breaking when it drops , there is no schock on it at all.Its like not having a case at all.Positive side is that it makes the iphone more cooler its a stylish case not for protection , you just have to be extra careful with the phone , because if it drops ! it will surely be the end of an expensive IPHONE.I recomend this case just for style .	-1
This is a nice looking case , the only problem I had with this was that the inside is not painted , looks like they tried using just enough paint on the outside to make it look good . I guess it does n't really matter once the case is snaped on to the phone but it still bugs me to see the poor quality ... If you must buy this style of case , you might want to consider one called Kroo Shell , I 'm not sure if they make it for the 1st Gen iPhone though .	-1
HOLY MOLY what a piece of garbage ! This has got to be the cheapest/dumbest iPhone case ever made ! Let me begin : I have an iPhone 4S 64 gig phone thing . I wanted a cheap black case for it . I was n't too concered with protection or whatever - just something to cover it . This one looks good . Look at the pics - looks nice , right ? Wrong ! It 's a cheap piece of bended metal/plastic . My phone fits in it - kinda - but it sure does n't feel secure ! It 's like a rounded piece of plastic - whereas your phone , if you 'll observe it - has SQUARED edges ! The part that really bugged me is that it does n't fit snug AT ALL : See the main photo here ? The one where you can see the back of the phone ? See how that apple symbol on the back of the phone lines up nice and flush with the back ? that is a LIE ! It 's not flush at all ! There 's like a huge GAP between the back of the phone and the back of this case - it feels TERRIBLE.Most of the ports are accessible when this thing is on - but good luck using the volume switches on the side of your iphone ! You CA N'T . This case has this rounded-edge thing going on , which prevents your fingertips from getting to those side switches . What a dumb design ! -Seriously - I know you 're looking for a cheap case - this ai n't it ! Believe me when I tell you to spend a few bucks more and get something you 'll actually USE and ENJOY . This is utter garbage !	-1
I 've had excellent success with Jabra Bluetooth handsfree products in the past , especially when used with Sony Ericsson mobile phones . In particular , my JX-10 and SP500 were the epitomes of compatibility , usability , and quality . So when I shopped for a new in-ear headset , the BT8040 seemed the obvious choice.My primary gripe with this unit is how its voice dialing DOES NOT WORK with the Sony Ericsson K790a , even though the Jabra site claims , `` It Will Work : ) `` . The earpiece never receives the audio prompt from the phone , so the phone waits forever for a voice command it can never receive . I tried my phone with other headsets ( OEM wired one , Aliph Jawbone , Moto H700 ) which all worked fully and flawlessly , so the phone is not at fault . I went through severl procedures with Jabra , who ultimately replaced the headset , all without success . Also , my older phones ( an S710a and T637 ) woked perfectly well . So there 's clearly a compatibility issue , once which Jabra refuses to acknowledge.Second , the BT8040 is a step backwards in usability from the JX-10 . On the JX-10 , all `` headset '' functions ( initiate call via voice dialing , answer call , end call ) required a single short button press , and `` handsfree '' functions ( reject incoming call , redial last call , call waiting switch , etc . ) needed only a single long button press . That could n't be easier . The BT8040 changes some of this for the worse , such as in requiring a double-press for voice dialing while still requiring single short- and long-presses for other functions . Jabra found perfection in its controls and usability , and lost it.Finally , the BT8040 's `` eargel version 2 '' does not adequately keep the headset from rorating around in , or falling out of , your ear . The separately sold Jabra Eargels v.1 ( which I used with my JX-10 ) are more stable and more comfortable . Sadly , these v.1 eargels do not fit this headset.With the BT8040 , Jabra 's maintained their other attributes - functionality , call quality and volume , build quality , small size and light weight - hence I give it 2 stars instead of one . But the incompatibility is unacceptable , especially with Sony Ericsson phones ( the kings of Bluetooth ) . The lacking usability and stability further diminish the BT8040 's desirability .	-1
I bought this headset in Aug 08 . Initially , I really liked it . The size was small and it is very light . It fit in my ear really well . It seemed to work fine for about a month or 2 , and then I began having complaints that people could n't understand me . The problem is this : To have the volume up loud enough to hear anyone caused my outgoing voice to be so loud that it made my speech sound slurred . Also , this headset did n't manage background noise well as I often had complaints . Callers sometimes complained of an echo tooThe unfortunate truth is that I received so many complaints that I had to get rid of the head set after only 4 months . What a waste of money ! ( Incidentally , I replaced this headset with the Plantronics Voyager 510 . After 1 month of usage , I like it alot ! Callers can hear me clearly and I can hear them well . It also eliminates a great deal of background noise . )	-1
I really wanted this to work out ! Needed a headset with noise reduction so I could use it in the car . Callers ca n't understand me when I 'm at my desk , and in the car is worse . I made sure to remove any plastic covers and upgraded the firmware . Many people praise the audio quality , so there must be a lot of variations in the units . I know mine sucks .	-1
I tested this unit against 8 other headsets and it had the worst sound quality , by far . I still ca n't beleive it ! Considering the special features designed for sound quality I was expecting the best sound ever , but oh well . The way I compared headsets was to pair two at a time , put one in each ear , and then switch between them while on the same call . This allowed me and the caller to compare sound quality equally while in a variety of environments , and from both ends of the call . I tested these headsets : Jabra BT8040 , Jabra BT500 , Plantronics Voyager 510 , Plantronics Explorer 320 , Motorola HS850 , Motorola H700 , Jawbone , Samsung WEP200 . The problem was that the sound quality for the caller was so bad that they could hardly understand a word I said . If I held the unit a few inches in front of my mouth they could hear me clearly but not when it was in my ear . With all the other units I tested I go through a series of background noise tests with both the caller and myself talking and listening , but in this case we were n't able to comunicate well enough to get that done . After testing the other units we went back and tried this one some more but nothing seemed to make a difference . This is a beautifull headset . It looks great , feels great , with great function and fit , but if they ca n't understand what I 'm saying then there 's no point . Man , I 'm bummed ! And I really liked this one , too !	-1
Poor quality for other person on the line to hear ... happens with all calls..dont waste your money ... spend more	-1
This headset was n't the best quality - it was great for me , the talker , but the mic did n't work so well . The person on the other end often had a hard time hearing me when I was talking in a quiet environment ( forget it when in the car ! ) . I 'd recommend something else .	-1
This item gets a dry-joint in the iphone side of the connection in a few short weeks . And then you 're stuck with it .	-1
Did n't work for connecting a card reader to a smart phone . It was useless , but the price was so low at $ 1.76 , so it was not worth the try to the post office .	-1
I thought this purchase would come in handy , but as I upgraded my IPhone it no-longer fits . Now I have to buy a jack to go with a jack .	-1
I ordered 2 of this item and 2 of theblack onesfrom 4 different sellers after reading very mixed reviews on both items . I needed the adapter pictured on both with the very short plastic head between the male plug and the cord . None of the 4 I received were the same as the item pictured . My reason for needing this is not the iPhone . It is to fit inside a tight spot on the back of a Makita job site radio.Without any regular use or ware and tear , each one sounded nearly identical when tested with music on an iPhone 4S and SkullCandy in-ear headphones . I am not an audiophile , the headphones are inexpensive , and the adapters have not been put under any stress yet.Here 's my report of each adapter : White adapter received from seller `` CRONUZ '' - 1 star : The cord feels flimsy . The plastic used on the cord and ends feels very rubbery . From my own experience with iPhone cases made of similar material , I suspect this cord with discolor and/or become dirty beyond cleaning if it does n't break before that.White adapter received from seller `` eTECH '' ( mailing label said `` iflash Inc '' ) - 1 star : The item looks identical to the one from CRONUZ . The only additional concern with this adapter is that I ca n't get the headphones to plug into this without using A LOT of force . I did force them in to test the sound quality , but I do n't plan on using this cord again . Also , because the 2 white adapters look identical , I would think this is a problem you might encounter no matter who you order from.Black adapterreceived from seller `` Eforcity '' ( not this listing ) - 3 stars : This adapter also has a flimsy cord . The plastic on the male end is slimmer and will fit into a tighter spot than the 2 white ones I tested . The hard plastic ends seem a little more durable than the ends of the white ones . I believe I can get some use out of this one , but would n't buy another one.Black adapterreceived from seller `` Elago Design '' ( not this listing ) - 5 stars : First of all , the 5 stars is based on this being less than $ 2 . I would n't say this is the best adapter you can buy . This is however the best one I tested . The cord is stiffer and feels more solid than the others . The female plug has a tighter fit and no play . The plastic around the male end is slimmer than all the rest . This cord does n't meet my immediate needs because of the longer plastic head , but I would buy this again for use with certain iPhone cases that block larger plugs.If you order this or any other item and do n't receive what was pictured and listed , contact the seller . Most of them would rather just give you a refund because they know they are shipping a different brand than what is listed .	-1
This thing broke on me after 4 months . Good thing I purchased 3 . The relief on this adapter is not that sturdy , but it works really well for a good amount of time . I had better luck with the same item from SF planet seller .	-1
Shipping service is terrible . Do n't expect to receive your order for at least 2 weeks . Product feels cheaply made , like the wire will snap at any moment , and above all , it does not work if you need all 4 channels .	-1
I bought two of these to help make keeping my otter box case on when needed to use the speaker/aux cable.The first cable worked for about 1 hour before it began to fray and separate . The second one only gave audio out of one side . You could pull the cable out slightly and get both channels ( sides ) , but if your gizmo ( phone , tablet , mp3 player ) moves the slightest then it stops working on both sides.The other bad thing is the static it creates when in use ( aux or headphones ) .The item is junk and I would avoid unless you like throwing away money .	-1
Very simply , this product does not work . Using it makes the sound very muffled to the point where it 's almost inaudible . Consider that there are MANY other reviews saying the same thing . I should have heeded their advice and not bought this .	-1
Bought this audio dongle for the sole purpose of using it in conjunction with my iPad Mini 's LifeProof Fre 's deep recessed headphone port & my Monster iSport Victory right-angle jack . The jack 's housing fits & passes Left & Right audio channels but I ca n't control a fully-functional in-line controls of my Monster iSport Victory in-ear earphones . No matter how much I twist the connection to make it connect , I could n't use the in-line controls . The cable seems thin & I 'm concern that it might not last as well . iPad Mini on iOS 6.1.3 while the iPad 2 is on iOS 7.0 if it matters . I 'll update this review once I get the chance to try it with my Beats MixR headphones ( in-line control cable also have a right-angle jack ) .	-1
These things got such bad reviews - that I ordered 3 just to be sure I got one good one ( at least they 're cheap ) . I gave them two stars instead of one since , oddly , 2 of 3 of them worked for their intended purpose ( a size adapter for my iPhone ) , though none of them work when plugged into my PC . Hard to imagine this is a very difficult product to manufacture - so I just assume the manufacturer could simply care less ... UPDATE : Turns out my 2 star review was way too generous . All 3 of these eventually stopped working properly . A truly staggering level of apathy by the manufacturer ...	-1
It worked only for two months then stopped working , well , it works on one side only , the other earphone get no sound .	-1
I purchased this item and it would not work when the headphone was plugged in all the way ... the sound was muffled . But it worked fine when the headphone was plugged in 3/4 of the way . Eforcity sent me a replacement at no charge but unfortunately the replacement does n't work at all .	-1
Does not give you Left and Right channels like it should . Music in unbearable and incorrect . Do not buy this .	-1
This does not let me use a 2.5 mm headset . The description now represents that accurately , but did not at the time I ordered it .	-1
Beware , you will not get the item that is pictured . You will get some sort of iPhone recessed port adapter ( kinda like the Belkin one ) but not nearly as good as the one in the picture.I gave mine away . I hope this prevents people from getting ripped off.The seller even tried to get to recall this negative comment and promised a refund . NEVER RECEIVED A REFUND.Tells you what kind of seller you 're dealing with .	-1
Purchased from Eforcity , US seller that I 've gotten a few items from before and quality was good for the price . Not this case . Item is the proper fit , and fits bumper cases or special cases that would only accept an Apple headphone jack ( ie thin ) .But , at first , I was getting audio from just one channel - Jiggling a bit the cable at the base of the male end , 2nd channel started working but was getting static noise by just moving the cable.Audio would then come and go , by briefly moving the cable.Filed claim for damaged item . Seems to me a $ 1.70 down the drain .	-1
This looked like an interesting and relatively low-cost option for my wife 's car/cell phone , since she has n't found a bluetooth headset that fits her ear comfortably . Unfortunately , we can not get this unit to pair with any of three cell phones ( iPhone 3G , two new Nokias ) . It goes into pairing mode as advertised , but none of our phones can find it ( they all find all of the headsets and computers we have tried pairing with other than this unit ) . Makes this rather useless , and I would strongly suggest testing your phone against one of these before ordering.Also disappointed in the lack of a USB or AC charger . My fault for not noticing that this only comes with a car charger - not very convenient for how we typically charge.No issues with the merchant - quickly shipped and delivered just fine . The low rating here is about the speakerphone , not the merchant .	-1
Could barely be heard when using this bluetooth device and not easy to hear who I called . Got progressively worse as power level was discharged . I do not recommend this product . My Garmin NUVI 660 has better bluetooth audio quality .	-1
Got the first one , loved it ... worked great with my ipod and my phone ... so I could listen to music and still be available to answer calls ... ( I have a basic phone , not a smartphone . ) The first one stopped charging after about 2 months ... got a replacement ... stopped taking a charge after two months ... This is too expensive to work for only two months and then nothing . Too Bad .	-1
Bought this to use with my iPhone 3GS . When I plugged it in , I got the 'not for iPhone ' charging message . Sure enough , it does n't charge properly . The problem is that , even when I 've taken care to make sure it 's securely seated , it wo n't consistently charge , so there 's no telling with any certainty when you unplug your phone in the morning , that it 'll be charged.Callpod charges my old LG phone , my husband 's Blackberry and my Nintendo DS , all flawlessly . This adapter was a bust . Have n't tried it with my husband 's iPod Touch , so ca n't say how it works for that device .	-1
after a couple of months this adapter 's housing around the ipod end of the plug fell apart . When that happened , one of the pieces got lost so i was n't able to glue it back together . I later decided to replace the whole callpod adapter with a powered usb hub . everything i needed to charge can be powered by usb anyway and with this setup i have no proprietary plugs or equipment to deal with .	-1
these are the cheapest chargers i have ever purchased . not only did some of them not work after a while some apple devices did not recognize them as an authorized charger . you pay what you get for . they were cheap in price and cheap in quality .	-1
I bought this set base on a lot of reviews saying it charge their Ipods . What I did n't realized is what kind of ipod they have , they might have a 3G nano as we know wo n't work with 4G nano . I tried the car charger , it works but can not play and charge at the same time . For the house charger it does n't . I look at the label and it say compatible with ipod 3G . However the product description says compatible with 3G , 4G nano , etc . I bought this to enable me to charge without having my computer running . The car charger is important if you are in your car for a long period of time charging without playing . Not worth returning , the postage cost more than the items .	-1
Neither of these chargers worked with any of the ipods in our house -- not the iPod touch , not the iPhone , and not the iPod Classics.It has been my experience with off-brand chargers that sometimes they will actually be charging even though the charge light does not light and sometimes that the item will work if you wiggle the connection or throw salt over your shoulder while attempting to get it to work . Nothing made these work.I left each item connected for between 8-24 hours , each , to find out if any of the ipods charged and they did n't .	-1
It does n't cost that much so thats a pro . But it fails at it 's main purpose -- Consistently charging the iphone 3G -- . It was very haphazard . Sometimes it worked and sometimes it did n't . And finally it just stopped working .	-1
I bought this because `` others '' bought it with the case I purchased . It was one of those last minute `` checkout '' decisions . I should have read the reviews better . Worked for a day after I received it then my 4th Gen iPod touch gives a message the charger isnt supported . The reviews are a little scary . The last thing I want is to fry my iPod . Not sure if I will bother returning it considering the price . I will probably keep the retractable cable and toss the chargers .	-1
these are intermittent , dont waste your time on the aftermarket products they just dont last , not worth the hassle of wondering if it will work	-1
I BOUGHT THE ITEM.I RECEIVE 2 BLACK AND 1 WHITE.I WILL NOT BUY MORE FROM THIS SUPPLIER .	-1
Stopped working in few days . No mishandling , no rough use , Just stopped working , Seems some mfg defect . I wont buy this again	-1
Within a few weeks the plastic covering near the plug ripped exposing the wires and after two months it stopped working . Not durable enough for cell phone use .	-1
This piece has never worked . I have a headset that works fine on my home phone that I wanted to convert for my office . But there is this consistent pulsing I hear and every caller tells me I am fading in and out . It 's like a bad corded bluetooth .	-1
picture is misleading - does n't have the 3 stripes you 'd need for the iPhone - only 2 stripes . Does n't work as advertized .	-1
Maybe I looked at the description wrong . But it just doesnt work . Perhaps i dont realize that there are many different types of these connectors for the SAME size ? The problem seems to be that the stereo speakers should have been wired together for a mono sound but they are n't ? Who knows and I 'm not about to rewire it . I bought a simple ear piece/boom mic from here and tried to use with my Droid . No go for me.Your mileage may vary	-1
I tried to use this for a plantronics headset , but the mic would n't work . I was able to hear the other side just fine . Do n't order this , it does n't work as advertised . One review mentioned that it worked perfectly when he purchased it back in 2008 . That person added onto his review to say that they changed something in the design because he has this same problem with the adapter . Just a heads up before you buy and are disappointed .	-1
I bought this to charge my old Nokia phone because I could n't find the original charger that came with the phone . This charger worked fine for the first few weeks but then it decided to stop working out of the blue . I have no idea what happened but it just would n't charge the phone . I had to throw it out because I saw no point in keeping something that does n't work .	-1
These are complete cheaters . First of all , the charger never fit my N73 phone slot . Secondly , after I wrote my 1st review criticisizing the product , they called me up saying that they will send me a new replacement charger and I should remove my negative feedback from Amazon . I waited for almost 3 weeks and the charger never showed up . I tried calling the same number from where I got the call , and no response.Complete waste of money , waste of time and a useless product which I had to trash in 10 minutes after I received it .	-1
The connection is bad and many times when I talk I can hear myself again , which means it echos like crazy and its not worth it to get something that will not work	-1
I ordered an OEM blackberry Headset a months ago , & it was just like the one that came with my Storm , could not tell the difference & the Amazon seller was BTO Inc.I placed another order for my wife headset , three weeks later & this time was offered by Amazon seller , `` the OEM shop '' for the same price . Since it stated it is an OEM item , I placed the order . Now that I received the order , it is very different than the first one that I ordered . The original blackberry headset & my first order , both have a very soft & flexible wire . But the one that I received from `` The OEM Shop '' has a very stiff & hard wire , not very flexible & it feels that it is going to break when folding it . I think it is a counterfeit of Blackberry OEM one . I will never buy from `` The OEM shop '' . It is not worth to send it back . So here is my Rating for this Item : The original & the one came from `` BTO Inc. '' , gets 5 stars.The one sold by `` The OEM Shop '' gets 1 star .	-1
If you listen to earbuds , then these headphones are great . If you are used to better quality sound , then you will notice the poor sound quality in these headphones . Pairing was easy and simple , however ; I purchased a deffective pair that would not hold a charge .	-1
It looks like the right charger , there 's power coming through it , but it does n't charge the phone . I even tested it with a multimeter . Then I went out and got an identical charger at Walmart and that worked fine . Go figure .	-1
These adapters did n't last more than a few days of daily use before breaking . Ironically they all failed just above the strain relief on the male plug.When these fail you 'll see exposed wires or the male end will break off - which in a way is a nice change from other adapters that fail internally and still look OK from the outside .	-1
I am not sure how somebody can screw up a simple audio cable extender cable , but these guys have done it . It is impossible to create a solid connection both inside the iPhone and when connecting the headphone jack . Once everything is snuggly plugged in , the slightest rotation/jerk of the cable in the iphone produces hiss and loss of contact . Same goes for the headphone jack . It 's like these things are made not to maintain a continuous contact where they 're supposed to have a contact . Avoid at all costs .	-1
Sound out of one ear only . In-line remote controls do n't work . No mic functionality either . This does n't appear to do anything other than waste your money.Go to the Radtech web site , where you 'll find a similar product , except it actually WORKS PROPERLY . It 's called the Procable Shortz Audio Extender . Unfortunately it is n't for sale here on Amazon .	-1
I bought this to use it with P.O.S . credit card readers ( most do n't fit my phone while it has a case on ) , and I made sure it was a four-pole connector . Although the seller did give me a full refund without question , my cable did n't work at all with any of the CC readers I have .	-1
I 'm not sure how long this worked for ... my girlfriend noticed that when she pushed the connection slightly , the bass would suddenly get richer ... .tested on a Nano and an iPhone 4S . Disappointing but it 's a super-cheap cable so ... .I missed the Amazon claim window by 2 weeks but Eforcity only covers this for 30 days . Where other companies would send out a replacement , no questions asked , this company does not . Buyer beware.NOTE : the connector did fit into the iPhone even with the case on , which was why I purchased it to begin with .	-1
I sent them back immediately . One of the channels did n't work consistently , and that side also held the microphone , so it did n't work either . Worthless.Five stars for the Amazon return process , though -- simple , easy , and quick .	-1
This NO is exactly what I was looking for - This NO is exactly what I was looking for -	-1
bought one , it broke on the 1st use . they sent me a new one for free and that one broke in 2 days.. the suction cup one the device is the problem ... i think . idk but i would spend an extra 10 and get a better one from amazon or drop 40 and just go to the apple store and buy it from there.DO NOT BUY	-1
I put this on the window and it popped off a few times I think because it was so new and stiff . I wanted to put it in the kitchen while washing dishes and cleaning in general to not only answer the phone but hear my music.. I was a little nervous at first but it now is fine.UP DATE pops off never got to use it but a couple of times for an hr or so , Dont waste money or time on it	-1
i would not get this again the windshield mount broke the first day a pain in the butt to put the mount on the air vent . i used it for my htc evo 4g cell not made well	-1
The case looked great and snapped on tight . But the minute I snapped it on , I realized , that I needed to remove the microSD card from the phone , copy some files on it and put it back . It is nearly impossible to remove the card from Centro without removing the battery cover first ( what clever engineer at Palm thought THAT would be a good idea ? ! ? ! ? definitely not a usability expert ) . So ... hmmm ... . yeah ... eventually couple of days later a fearless friend of mine pried it open with his extremely sharp almost surgical quality blade . He did not break it , but said that the case will not survive if I had to open it on a regular basis . So - its a great case if you never need to open the battery cover . If you do need to open it - look for a different case .	-1
This is basically a very cheap plastic case.. if you want to be cheap ... go for it . The case always unsnaps itself randomly for no good reason . You have to somehow put it on just the right amount to get it not to unsnap . However , you still can easily unsnap the case off and I 'm just glad the phone has n't fallen out yet . The swivel clip is also very very hard to press down and take out the phone ... You are going to have to have your fingers pushing on both ends of the clip in order to get the phone out of the clip . This is annoying when trying to answer a call or trying to get to a text message . The only pro about this product is that it 's cheap .	-1
Should have read he reviews , would have not bought it	-1
This item was recommended as a piggyback purchase when I purchased a Plantronics Voyager Pro+ bluetooth headset . It was advertised as a desktop charging stand for the headset . Apparently , it 's a base for the Voyager 510 charger ( the old , first Voyager that Plantronics introduced , which I owned light-years ago in technology time ) . The Pro+ fits awkwardly in it ( tight fit ) and the base does not come with a charger ( although the picture shows a cord attached to it ) . It 's just a desktop weight and the Voyager Pro+ 's charger does not fit . When you jam it in there , the base does not sit flat and rolls around on the desk . It does not stand vertically . In sum , it 's a rather expensive paperweight that advertises Plantronics . Thanks for nothing and i hope it helps some of you save your money .	-1
As the other reviewers stated , this is literally just a stand . There is no charging capabilities with this stand . All you get is the round disc that holds your plantronics voyager pro headest upright . I personally do n't care whether my headset is laying flat on my counter or standing up . If you would like your headset to be standing up all nice and pretty than buy this stand , if not save your money any purchase an additional charger for your headset .	-1
This product is a bad joke ! It is n't a charging stand at all ! It is simply a plastic disc that is `` supposed '' to fit and hold the earpiece . I ca n't make it function as described and I am a mechanical engineer ! It did not come with any instructions at all . It arrived in a simple clear plastic bad with nothing else . I rate this at as a total waste of my money !	-1
CAUTION : To get an entire product usable on your device you are likely to have to deal with TWO , maybe MORE , separate vendors , shipments , multiple shipping charges , and hard to find specs on what tip fits what Exactly which devices . NO ONE cares enough to really help you out . Returns of some part ( s ) are likely , and add more to cost and to your wait for a fully functional product . It is NOT the product , it is the AMAZON and SUB-VENDOR system that creates a mess.I would avoid this product like poison !	-1
Broke within minutes of me attaching it to my phone and clipping it to wat waistband . Do not waste your money .	-1
I had high expectation for this headphone since I owned one Etymotic before and liked it . Once I got it , I put it on my phone and the plug did n't work properly . The headphone kept disconnecting and reconnecting back with phone while I was walking my dog . First , I thought it might be my phone since it is about two years old . So I put it on my boyfriend 's phone ( Galaxy SIII ) and magic happened ... The headpone does n't fit in completely and I had to push it to get connected . So disappointed and returning it , waiting for UPS pick-up .	-1
I have to say I 'm shocked at all the extremely positive reviews here , I ca n't be the only person who thinks these are over-rated and over-priced ? I 'll start by saying I 'm far from an audiophile ( that would be my husband ) , but I am madly in love with my ipod touch . I use it very little for music but extensively for watching movies , shows , etc . The stock earbuds are pretty awful as we all know , besides medicore sound quality they are just so uncomfortable so I was on the look out for something more comfortable for myself and something with great sound for my husband who uses his ipod touch every day on his 1 1/2 hour commute to/from NYC.What we ended up with was a pair of these and a pair of the vmoda'sV-MODA Vibe Earbuds - Gunmetal Blackwhich retail for about $ 100 less.I had already decided these would be mine , as I said he 's the audiophile but strangely does n't mind the stock earbuds and did n't care what he ended up with . I was so excited when they arrived , I had already tried out the vmoda 's and really really liked them and assumed with the $ 100 price difference these would be that much better.Love ended quickly , I thought it was to difficult to put them in my ears ( pull your ear up and out with one hand , twist in with the other ) sure it blocked out the outside sound but in a `` head underwater in the bathtub '' manner , the sound was n't clear and true but muffled to me , and no bass ... just none . I tried all the different size fittings , tried putting them in different ways ( yes I tried a very deep tight fitting , still awful ) , tried different songs . I was in disbelief so I grabbed hubby and made him try them vs the vmodas , he agreed instantly that the vmodas were infinitely better . I did find if I gently ( not pushing so much as just barely touching ) held my finger tips to them when they were in that the sound was much better , but I 'm not going to use them with my index fingers in my ears . Maybe I got a bad pair , maybe my ears just work better with the vmoda ... whatever the reason I was n't impressed with these and feel that the $ 100 you 'd save by getting the vmoda 's could be applied to a new ipod or lots more music from itunes.I did n't have the chance to try them out as a phone as I do n't have an iphone , and I 'm not sure if the double click to advance songs only works on an iphone , it did n't work on my ipod touch ( would have been a very nice feature if it did ) .The case these come with is nice though , for what that 's worth .	-1
I have been a religious advocate of Etymotic canalphones since the original ER6 came out and I 've been using a set of ER6i 's for 3 or 4 years now.First the good : The HF2 's are clearly superior to the ER6i 's with a mellower , less shrill topend while still managing to retain crisp definition and equal or exceed the bass of the ER6i . The HF2 still does n't have the base of a Shure or Ultimate Ear , but overall I prefer the Etymotic sound.Then the not so good : Sadly at least on my BlackBerry , the microphone is terrible . It simultaneously has low gain yet no sound isolation . The people I call tell me that I 'm muffled and hard to understand and I have to speak loudly to be heard even if I 'm in a quiet location . Forget being able to talk on these in the car or at an airport or when walking outside . The people I call can only hear rushing wind or background noise.Another flaw is that the microphone hole is tough to get located near the mouth . I find that I have to hold the mic up near my mouth and make sure it is n't twisted to point away.Then the terrible : I sent an email to Etymotic expressing my disappointment with the mic and asking if there was a chance that I had a bad microphone . They never responded to my email . I will try again , but so far I 'm pretty disillusioned with the HF2 . I suppose I 'll have to call them and try to get an RMA ( I let the return period with Amazon expire . )	-1
I 've replaced this a few times from different sources and I do n't find these rings go on properly . I 've had others try as well and they could n't get it to fit right either .	-1
ask for more money for express shipping and it takes longer than regular mail . It took almost two weeks to receive item . I wrote to seller and seller never contacted me .	-1
This phone was so basic , it was little more than a thin calculator . The manual was all in Spanish and some of the menu options on the phone itself were too . Could n't distinguish between lower and uppercase and just a general dirt-cheap phone . Would never recommend to anyone .	-1
Mine lasted 4 days before the screen quit . There is a reason these are sold with no warranty ! I wasted $ 40 on one .	-1
This battery never worked . Would not hold a charge . I left it plugged in over night and the battery never charged up .	-1
I really wanted this to work but it never charged my phone for more than 2 minutes . Do n't buy it .	-1
I used this once . Now it doesnt see the charger unless I push it in hard - and when I do , or use a different charger , it never charges . Now its for the landfill .	-1
I bought this hoping many of the stellar reviews would trump the many poor reviews , but unfortunately it turned out to not be the case for me.I ordered the item to be able to charge my new AT & T ; Inspire 4G , by HTC . It 's a battery hog , so having a portable recharge would be great.I opened the box , and was really excited because the product is sexi to look at ... it 's not one of the dark black boxy electronics you usually associate with this type of product . It 's curvy and nice looking.Initial read of the instructions proved to be a challenge , as it 's clearly a manual that was written in Chinese and then translated and converted to english for North American sale . It was a bit contradictory and vague in a couple aspects , so I went online and watched the how-to , just so I could say with certainty I was using it properly.I charged it initially for 24 hours ( it recommends 4-6 hours ) , and the instruction manual that came with it said one light will flash when it was completed charging . After 24 hours , TWO lights were still charging . I went onto their website and it states that when charging is complete , the light should remain on and solid . However this was not the case for me.I decided based on the specs , 24 hours should have been more than enough to charge it ( by technological spec 5 hours from complete drain to full charge is all it should take ) . I plugged in my device , and immediately all 4 lights lit up on the battery pack indicating full capacity . After 5 minutes , it dropped to 3 , then after 10 minutes it went to 2 ... At this point I contacted the manufacturer . They were quick to respond that it 's likely defective . I questioned if they see this a lot and they said yes . I asked why they do n't resolve it and they said ( in broken english ) that it was what people expect for half the price of the competition . Seems a bit odd of a response from them . To me I 'd want to put out the best ( usable ) product for the price , or not put out a product , but hey , whatever.BOTTOM LINE : Amazon is issuing me a refund as I 'm sending this one back . Normally I 'd give the benefit of the doubt and re-order another one , but given the less than impressive response from the manufacturer , I 'm planning on returning for a refund . I 'm going to order the Zagg Sparq 2.0 , which gets great reviews . At almost 2x the price , I 'll have to suck it up and pay for it , but I suppose if I want a product that comes with warranty and support , that 's the cost of it . I also learned that Amazon does n't have a lot of flexibility in their marketplace seller practices , so they said their hands are tied . I 'll stick to ordering direct from Amazon going forward . : - (	-1
Unpacked it and plugged it into a charger . The second , third and fourth LED 's lit up . Seemed to be charging OK , and external LED and laser light worked fine.After about 30 seconds , all the LED 's went out , the power button did nothing no matter how many time or how long it was pressed , and unit is totally dead.Back it goes . So glad I spent the extra $ 4 so I would have it in time for a weekend trip .	-1
Gt the product for free , basically purchased the larger charger and received this guy as a free gift . Well , it 's junk . Device does n't charge . When plugged in the charge lights come up for a few seconds indicating its charging than the unit shuts down . Like many other posters , mine probably is defective . Anyhow , my advice is to avoid .	-1
This charger is simply the best . I use it with my iPhone 5 and it works flawlessly . I 'm getting almost 3 charges before the iTorch needs to be recharged . Never again will I worry about being stranded with a dead phone . Do n't hesitate to buy one ! UPDATE 4/7/13 - Unfortunately , I spoke too soon . In my enthusiasm I purchased a second charger shortly thereafter and that unit was DOA ( would not turn on after a full charge ) . Since I still had faith in New Trent , I ordered a third charger and this one was also DOA . In all only 1 out of 3 chargers performed as expected . Very disappointed .	-1
The product works just as advertised , charging my iPhone to full a few times on one charge . Really gives me peace of mind toward the end of the day.UPDATE February 2014 : Broke after 5 months of use .	-1
After a couple of months of use , battery wont charge what a waste of money . . I think its waste of money to buy a charger that only last 3months .	-1
I really loved this when I first got it . It charged well and the battery lasted a long time . When I went to charge it a second time it would not charge . I do not know if mine was just defective or what but I had to return mine .	-1
It lasted only 11 months of very light usage.It is also easy to depress the button by accident while in the bag , and ended up turning on the laser for a long period of time unintentionally .	-1
The product arrived and I read the instructions and charged the battery for the recommended time . Product did not work , It had no charge . I charged it again , andthen same issue . I was only offered a refund and not a replacement . The product in my book is suspect . Be advised that you may have to go through multiple purchases and shippings in order to receive a functional device .	-1
I wanted to love this case but I just did n't . The build quality was mediocre , it had sharp seams on the edges that kinda hurt my hand and I had to whittle them down with an x-acto blade . Also , the back is textured , which you would think would be a grip improvement over the naked aluminum ( most of the reason I want a case to begin with ) but the texture actually makes it slicker and harder to hold than the naked unit . Since then I 've picked up a Power Support Air Jacket and really like that better ... it 's much more expensive but worth it over this second-rate case .	-1
I would not bother on this model . Tried them out for a day or two and they sounded like muffled waffles that had too much syrup poured on them ! Bluetooth connected and disconnected randomly . Sound was not solid , but tinny.Get the Sound Matters speakers I reviewed today if you want a good solid pair of speakers that will work and last a long time.Sorry Altec , but you blew it on this one !	-1
Oh it fits the iPhone with Mophie Plus case -- perfectly ! But in barely 2 weeks ... .the clip has already torn from the case , and I NEARLY LOST my iPhone 4S and Mophie Air case , it was barely hanging by a few threads . If I could give it negative stars for the lack of security this case offered , I would.So ... .not a good investment ... .find something ELSE ! What else can I say ... . ?	-1
The plastic clip on the first one broke about Day 2 . I figured it was just a manufacturer 's defect , so I contacted the seller and was quickly shipped a replacement - no questions asked . Interestingly the replacement had a metal belt clip . It lasted about a month before finally tearing out from the poorly secured and flimsy `` leather '' phone pouch.Do n't waste your money . There are good products which will fit a large phone ( iphone4 with Mophie Juice . )	-1
It looks like top button is exposed in pics . Not the case and this will ruin your iphone . I had 2/4 iphone 4s where the top botton stopped working because you have to press so hard .	-1
the audio has static and you cant really get a good listening experience with this adapter . which might be expected . i used with an old phone just for music but it did n't work out . i 've since thrown it out . both phone and adapter .	-1
product works but after 2 days the wires are exposed..i give it another few weeks before its completely damaged and i take very good care of it .	-1
for everyone who is searching over and over again on amazon trying to find a headphone adapter for their HTC , etc phones , read this.there are basically four options.1+2 . there is this adapter , and there is the one that is straight instead of right-angled . they are shipped interchangeably.3 . the HTC oem 3-1 adapter . this is the one with the 3 and 2.5mm , mini-USB , and power ports.4 . the HTC oem mic+headphone adapter . locally , my t-mobile store carries this one.i own all of these.3 is probably the best quality , but it 's very large and bulky . that fact will probably mean you will stress it more often and it will not last , not to mention being a pain in the *** in the meantime . this one is good for the desk , but not for carrying around.4 adds around 5 feet of cable to your headphones . a worse pain than option 3. you do get a working mic though.this item , option 1+2 , are the lightest weight , and smallest . the problem is that they are complete junk . unfortunately this is really the only reasonable option . so buy 2 , and expect them to last somewhere between 0 and 90 days . i 've owned 3 : one lasted less than a day , one lasted 2 weeks , and another lasted 3 months , under what i 'd term heavy use .	-1
Well , you get what you pay for , sometimes . I wanted to believe this adapter was going to solve my headphone jack problems , but alas , ten minutes into my workout it had fallen completely apart and the wires had detached .	-1
I recently purchased this product after reading all reviews to pair with my new iphone 3gs . I wanted to use for listening to podcasts and music as well as the telephone functions . I was disappointed in the thin sound quality , the difficulty in getting a decent fit , the lack of a pause function for my podcasts and music and lastly the constant on and off performance during listening . I never used it away from my phone to make sure there were no distance issues . I had some difficulty in operating the sync , on and off functions and getting in and out of my car caused it to fight with my built in car bluetooth . The unit is light , inexpensive at 35-40.00 and has decent build quality . Lack of a pause function is a deal breaker as well as the constant stopping and starting while listening to content . It was unusable so I had no choice and had to return to store . I wanted to like it because of the price and weight . I read the manual completely and am an experienced user of tech . Phone function worked well .	-1
I loved all the features of my N95 , although the screen was really too small for internet browsing . Then , after only a few months of normal use , my Nokia N95 began having video problems . The video would go dark , or display upside down and backwards , or show half the screen and half snow , with the visible half reversed . It would fail for a few hours , then magically resume normal operation . Sometimes powering it down repeatedly would bring it back to life , but without a screen , it 's very difficult to operate . Warranty repairs , with shipping , equaled the cost of a new iPhone . Never again will I spend so much money for a phone with moving parts .	-1
This charger obviously does n't put out much current , because it will hardly raise the battery level on my phone after several hours of charging time ( Nokia 5800 XM ) . On top of that , it wo n't even work on my PSPgo . Not very useful at all . I suppose in an emergency it will give me some power for my phone , so I 'll give it 2 stars for that , but I really ca n't recommend it.EDIT : I have discovered that the supplied USB cable was partially at fault for the low output . Using a Nokia USB charge cable I get a useful charge rate . Still not a fast charge , but fast enough that I can use the phone while charging it . With the supplied cable the charge rate was so low that if the phone was not in standby ( or off ) it would not gain any charge at all , and might even continue to drain . Crap cable , toss it ! With proper cables I have used this successfully on a few devices now . Still giving it 2 stars though , for including the crappy USB cable .	-1
First it wouldnt even charge my Motorola Cliq XT but that couldbe because of the phone . Then it would n't even turn on after one week .	-1
does not work on ipod touch 4g , dont know of its cause it was broken already out the box , LEDs dont work what is this ? ! garbage , dont buy guys	-1
It does n't charge my AA batteries in the case , and it actually drains the battery of any device connected to it . Actually , to be fair , it charges the device for about 10 minutes , then the flow seems to reverse , and it exhausts the battery of the device it 's supposed to be charging . I threw it in the recycling bin .	-1
I have n't had this very long but so far it 's great . I put four fully-charged eneloop batteries in it and was able to charge up my iPhone to 100 % in less than an hour , and the Tekkeon still seems to have plenty of juice . You can charge the AA batteries while they are inside the unit , so once they are in there you never need to take them out . Good price , well build device , comes with a little cloth drawstring bag for carrying around in your laptop bag , purse or backpack . Highly recommended for people with smartphones that drain their batteries in a day.EDIT : Changed this to a 2-star review from a 5-star . The device has developed a strange metallic smell ; this can not be a good thing . Also the amount of charge that I can get from fresh batteries has dropped significantly . I 'm afraid to use the device for fear of starting a fire or leaking battery acid everywhere ...	-1
Bought this with eneloop AA rechargable batterys..I began to charge/play my Video Mp3 player..Within 5 to 10 mins I picked up the charger..The charger was stove hot , smelling and melting..To think that I was just about to leave the room for a while ... .Scary situation..Why make these things out of thin plastic material ? Dangerous ... ...	-1
I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this . After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed , easily and permanently , with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data . A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out . And many live in areas where cell signals are just weak . But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office . Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago . It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming . It also works world wide on WIFI for $ 5 a month . Service is unlimited and has no contract . An unlimited call and text plan is $ 10 a month , and unlimited cell , text and data is $ 25 a month . You do have to use their phone ( Moto X $ 299 or Moto G $ 149 ) because they need Republic 's proprietary software to work at these rates . I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly .	-1
Does not work to boost cell signal in a basement . Had to exchange for large office and omni directional antenna . As expected , Amazon was wonderful exchanging for the better model and shipped it right away . Returns and exchanges are so easy with Amazon so I never fear oredering because they always make it right .	-1
The cell phone service in my place is n't too bad . It 's about what you 'd expect - you look at your cell phone and see that you have a full signal , but as soon as you place a call , or go online , it drops to 1 or 2 bars.I was hoping this thing could fix that - or at least give me a stronger signal.I set it up as best I could - I live in a condo - but saw no difference in cell phone signal strength before and after plugging this thing in . As I am in a condo , I could only put the receiver up against a window , not outside on a pole or something.I saw the video , read the instructions , but still received no increased signal strength or call clarity by using this product.One odd thing - the receiver says to point a certain side of it towards the cell phone tower . I want you to look around your area right now - do you see a cell phone tower ? Any idea where one might be ? Yah , me neither.I am going to give this to someone else who has much worse cell phone reception in their home than myself , and if they have better luck , I will update this review.But for now - PASS .	-1
The packaging for this indicates the ability to boost signals up to 1500 feet . I purchased this for use in my home and found that it would not work for my application . I called Wilson Electronics for technical assistance . They were very good at helping me troubleshoot my issues . Ultimately , we determined it would not work for me and I returned it.The unit comes with a directional antenna . It would not work for me because there is a large hill between my home and the nearest cell tower 1.7 miles away . The signal bounces into my location and is very weak . This type of situation calls for an omnidirectional antenna.Given the weakness of the signal , we determined the amp would not be powerful enough to provide a useful boost . I would need to purchase on many times the cost of this DT to see a usable signal.In addition , the useful distance of the small desktop antenna provided with this booster is only useful within a few feet . Ideally , it will provide signal within close proximity of your desk for a single room in your home but nowhere near what would be required to provide signal to an entire floor of your home for example . This information came from a very honest and helpful tech support person at Wilson.I returned this unit and have opted not to purchase another since the appropriate booster for my home would cost thousands .	-1
I bought this when I switched from AT & T to T-mobile . TM 's signal is much weaker and does n't penetrate my apartment like ATT 's does in downtown San Francisco . The signal is OK pretty much everywhere else so I got this booster for home . Does it work ? Probably , if you are willing to drill a hole in your wall , run the cable to the roof , have a spare outlet and are willing to put up with the extra electricity charge and equipment necessary . My landlord will not let me drill or install the cable . I tried putting it in a couple of windows and it did n't improve the signal at all ; apparently not high enough .	-1
I had to return it because it did not meet my application . In our home which is 3 stories , it did not boost the cell phone range well .	-1
When you buy this item are you REALLY expecting to first figure out where the nearest cell phone tower is to your house and in exactly which direction ? Then are you REALLY planning on climbing up on your roof to erect a pole so that this thing can point directly at that cell phone tower ? No , like me you 're thinking you can stick this to the window and it will increase your reception . Well it wo n't . So my suggestion is do n't buy it ; you just end up returning it the way I did .	-1
I got this for my non technically inclined brother so he could get good home cell signal . I walked him through the install over the phone and he cold not get it working . Next time I visited I spent 4 hours trying to get this to work . He lives in a marginal coverage area but it seemed to always be interfering with itself . I took it home where I have ok coverage and it did boost the signal marginally.I did get it to work well once I found the direction of the nearest tower and aligned it just right . The issue then was that the supplied cable was so short the booster and repeater were interfering with each other . So I went to radio shack and got a 50 ' cable and put the receiver in the attic and the repeater in the basement . I got good reception as long as I was within 10 ' of the repeater . Useless for my brothers needs.Overall I was not impressed . But when I wanted one for 4g I got a Wilson Electronics 815126 Sleek 4G-V Cell Phone Signal Booster - Retail Packaging - Blackhttp : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003NQ5NWI/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_hst_38Its only for a single phone or jetpack but it works great !	-1
Give this one a pass . it worked for a week or two , then the suction cup quit sticking . Poorly designed cup tension mechanism , and the holder came apart on its own .	-1
Blackberry Screen Protector / B0014Z1B80I have a Blackberry 8310 ( which can be found in the `` Options '' -- > `` About '' menus ) , which supposedly is what this screen protector is designed to fit . And , indeed , the screen protector is perfectly shaped to fit on the screen from just above the roller ball , all the way up to the silver speaker above the `` BlackBerry '' logo.But here 's the thing : This product has shown me that my Blackberry screen is not perfectly flat . Run your fingers over your 8310 and if you have the same model as me , you 'll see what I mean - the black area with the `` BlackBerry '' logo is gently rounded into a `` bump '' shape.So it really does n't matter that the protector went on cleanly for me , or that the second pull tab worked fine and did n't leave a sticky residue , or that the shape of the protector is perfect . It does n't matter because no matter how careful you are to push all the air bubbles out , they will creep steadily back in in the niche between the `` BlackBerry '' bump and the actual screen . And this lateral air bubble ends up taking up a fair whack of screen real estate , unless you press it out every single time you want to use your phone . *However* , all that said : This package came with three screen protectors , so after going through the first two with the same results , I trimmed the third one so that it cuts offs instantly before the `` BlackBerry '' bump . And now the screen protector works perfectly - flat , no air bubbles , no sticky mess , and good protection from scratches , fingerprints , and the mild rough handling it receives in my purse.So I guess I recommend these for the price ... if you 're willing to modify them yourself ... and if you can cut a clean , straight line . I 'm just extremely annoyed that the people who produce this product could n't figure this out and pre-cut it FOR me . Or , you know , create a screen protector that could handle a slight bump without creating a permanent air bubble . But , for the price , I guess you get what you pay for.~ Ana Mardoll	-1
There are two stickers , one on the the protective screen and one on the backing . These stickers are used to separate the protective screen from the backing . Unfortunately the sticker attached to the actual screen would not peel off . This leaves the screen protector unusable . There were three screen protectors and they all had the same problem .	-1
That was so not cool , I searched for a screen protector especifically for my Blackberry 8350i and when it arrives , it does n't fit my blackberry ! ! ! ! ! I am so pissed off , they either sent me the wrong product or advertised it wrong . Either way , I did n't take any action because the product is so cheap that it would cost its price to return it and it 's too much of a hasle.I did still put it on my screen even though it does n't fit ( too big ) and amazingly it still did n't fall off and looks very transparent and it 's very protecting . If this fit my phone it would 've been the best product ever because the quality of this thing is very good.Seller , if you 're reading this , I deserve a real 8350i Blackberry Curve screen protector.Thanks .	-1
I have been protecting the screen of my BB curve for the past 3 yrs . I custom cut it from a long universal plastic screen protector . For a change , I order this product and dismayed of it . The good side of it are a . ) it has a tiny cleaning cloth ; and b . ) 100 % exactly the same size of BB screen . The bad side are : 1 . ) it ca n't be re-applied if you mess-up ; and 2 . ) one of the 2 tabs that said `` please peel of this mask before application '' is harder to remove . The paste on it had dried signifying that it is an old stock.It is faster and satisfying to cut the old way . I odered 5 pieces of it ( 5x3 =15 ) and it would take me awhile to finish it off . I wasted 2 already in my initial application . The first was trash-out cause it would not stick for re-alignment . The second , I used a wet napkin to remove the dried paste and it not only leave scratches on new screen protector but the dried paste ca n't be removed at all . The more I attempt to remove the dried paste , the bigger the area it spreads its sticky mess.It 's not worth returning and will just throw it away and go back to the old way of doing it .	-1
this screen protection is for the blackberry curve i got only 3 in the pack i only used 1 to put on works great !	-1
No good . Used this a handful of times for *light* duty of charging a phone . After using about 5 times , I received a red fault light . Plugged a couple more times into the cigarette lighter to see if problem resolves , and it blew the fuse on the car . Will not buy this brand again.Company would not stand behind product - told me to contact Amazon , but b/c it was more than 30 days , I 'm out of luck .	-1
The Motorola Travel Charger for Motorola RAZR 2 V8 , V9 , V9M , Q9 , and Q9H worked for about a 8 months . I left it plugged in and just connected or disconnected the phone . It stopped working after about 6 months . Too bad . The cord was over 4 feet and , at least for me , the perfect size .	-1
I am thankful to find a charger that will charge my older Motorola Rapture ( VU30 ) phone , but I am so aggravated by the claim this is a Motorola product when indeed it is not . Motorola is used throughout the Product Description without any mention of `` Motorola compatible '' , so I expected to receive a Motorola branded charger . It works , so I will keep the product and see how long it lasts .	-1
When I recently received this battery , I immediately noticed that it suspiciously looked `` used '' ( it had deep marks scratched on the ends ) and I had my doubts ... But , I wanted to give it the benefit of doubt and went ahead and charged it for use.It appears this is NOT a new battery for it only holds a charge on `` Stand by Only '' ( with no calling at all ) for just four days ( and I am in a good 3G area ) ... a new battery is supposed to last `` up to '' 10 days on stand by only . This battery I received is no better than the old worn out battery I am trying to replace . Why would it be advertise as a `` new '' battery when it is obviously used ? In fact , my old battery looks newer than this one.Maybe it was my order ... but , because of this seemingly false advertising , I can not recommend .	-1
bought 5 cables for my 3gs after reading many reviews but none of them is working . They say this accessory is not supported everytime I plug it in . USELESS	-1
I bought mine from `` Seller1ON1 '' as an extra cable for my iPhone 4S . For less than $ 1 shipped , I figured I did n't have anything to lose . I knew I was getting an inferior item . I just needed an emergency cord to keep at home . Cosmetically , the generic and OEM cables look very similar , but the construction on this cable feels very cheap . Where the cord joins the pin connector , the sheath is shorter and not glued in , so the wire covering can come undone if pulled on repeatedly through use . It 's also crooked ( see my photos in gallery ) . Be careful to grip the connector pin , not the cord.It fits the 4S , transfers data , and charges , but the fit is very tight . It requires force to insert and remove and I 'm afraid of damaging my phone 's pins . Tested on aniPod nano ( 5th Generation ) as well with same results . My original cable does not require me to forcibly yank out the cord . I would recommend spending the extra money to get the official Apple cable , unless you need one just as backup and do n't mind it getting lost or breaking easily .	-1
I have an original USB charging cable from over two years and never had a problem . I recently wanted to have an extra cable and I bought this one . In less than three months it started to show problems ... charging was constantly interrupted and I had to move the cable a bit so it would start charging again . Today it was not working at all and the cable completely ripped apart.It may be cheap but definitely not worth if only last 3 months . I better go to Apple store and buy an original one .	-1
I ordered 5 of these . After a week only 2 still work . The connector end is a fraction too large so you have to sort of push hard to get it to plug into the iPad 1 , 2 , or iPhone 4 . The cable also pulls easily from the modules , at both ends , exposing the internal wiring . Immensely poor quality . Is the seller/manufacturer had paid closer attention to the manufacturing tolerances , and sealed the cable inside the module with a little glue or maybe heat shrink , it would be much better .	-1
the cable does n't work , not sure if I got a bad cable or something I soon as I put it in nothing happen it wo n't work in the wall or in my PC , good thing it was cheap or I would have been really piss .	-1
Well the cable took over a month to get here and it worked the couple of times i charged my ipad and now it does n't work at all just stay away from these made in China and just get the original	-1
Does n't last long at all . Shortly after I got this cord , it went out . I would say find a quality cord or stick with Apple .	-1
Dont trust it , it failed after a week just like every other knockoff I have purchased . Get a good brand name and tape it to something you never lose .	-1
I do n't recommend this item , its says apple compatible ( when I plug the USB to my laptop to charge the phone it says ... . item not supported )	-1
This work as well as you 'd expect for a cheap cable . I order these for my kids and toss them when they break . My kids break these at a rate slightly higher than the oem cables .	-1
Every time I plug this so called `` product '' into iPhone 4 , it says `` Impossible to charge with this device '' . Or something like that . What is the reason of buying it ? ! Just another disappointment ...	-1
Whenever I plugged my iphone 4s up with this cable it would charge and then disconnect within seconds and it did this until it finally just stopped working all together . Another iphone accessory that I wasted money on . It makes more sense to just buy the accessories from Apple . It 's more money , but it 's worth it , at least they 'll work .	-1
Order 20 , 30 pin Apple cables none of them work with any of our devices , computers and power supplies . It was a good price , well good if the product worked , and probably less than return postage .	-1
I got this pack of 5 cables knowing that they were not original apple cables nor original replacements . Knowing this I know the issues that come with these cables , if you disconnect them by pulling on the cable instead of the connector they tend to fall apart which is not a problem for me as I allways remove from the connector not pulling on the cable , however these are so cheaply made that even with this care they stop working . 3 out of the 5 cables are dead now , I havent used the other 2 one of them is falling apart at the joint of the dock connector due to the natural twist of the cable . The other two just even get recognized by my device any longer even though the cable looks in perfect shape . If you wiggle the cable it will eventually connect but the moment you touch the device it will drop the connection .	-1
Save your money . Two of these things shorted out , fortunately my devices were n't garaged . These cables are cheap rubbish , really !	-1
Does not fit my iPhone 4 . Cheaply and poorly constructed . I was really duped by this sale and do not recommend others buying this item except directly from Apple .	-1
These are weak and very poorly made . You would be better off if you spent a little more money and purchased a more expensive cable it would be worth your time and money to do so .	-1
I bought 2 of these . One came really long , and the other came really short . Strange.I have noticed it is verrrrry slow on charge time . I mean , painfully slow ... aint nobody got time for dat ! ; - ) I also think it might be affecting my overall charge because I notice it is not holding as long of a charge since I have been using it . Not worth it . Pay a little more for a real one .	-1
have purchased four and all of them stop working they spit at the end of the cord , one the plug can apart	-1
i ordered this sets of cords a couple of weeks ago 7/20 , set of four , fist cord is already broken 7/31 , it didnt fall apart , it just wont charge . i am a firm believer in , `` you get what you pay for '' , i read other reviews and went with this product , just a tad bit more , but see hear is the thing , these people are making millions by selling faulty ware to people like me that wont return a product . I paid for four chargers , after 5 days the charger isnt working , now i am down to 3 , this is not right , so people , pay the $ 20 buck for an original apple charger you will be better off . i am sure before the end of next month I will once again be searching for chargers ... smh	-1
I bought 2 of these and they both stopped working within about a month . I did n't spend a lot of money but obviously something is wrong with them .	-1
These cables did not do the trick for me . They lasted a week or so , and immediately started to fall apart botha t the base o the wire , and at the metal part . The wire also started to rupture after a few weeks .	-1
The only reason that I gave this product 2 stars is because it works . If it were n't for that it would get a 1 . After only a week the cable part is starting to pull out of the bottom of the part that goes into my phone . I can see the cables so I am questioning how long it will last.The sad part is that this is an extra cord that I keep in my bedroom for charging my phone at night . The only action it sees is 1 plug in at night and 1 unplug in the morning.I was n't really expecting much for what I paid but with how little I actually handle it I am pretty disappointed .	-1
When I unplugged this for the first time it came apart . I paid cheap I got cheap . Not even worth the time to comment	-1
After about 4 month of usage , it is broken today . I 'd expect a simple USB cable should n't last that short time	-1
I bought two of these and within the month the head had come loose from the wire cover exposing the wires . Basically fell apart and stopped working . I went to Monoprice and got some iPhone cables for just as cheap but they were very high quality .	-1
You got what you pay for . Got the inexpensive wires to fin that will not work with my IPad 2 . I use it for other devices but did not work for what I purchased for .	-1
I bought from ccceaccessories for 1 penny . I guess you get what you pay for . Fell apart after only one week of minimal use . Bought this has a 3rd spare cable for fiancee , it broke very quickly .	-1
I was skeptical because I read some not so great reviews . It works to charge and to sync . I take good care of my cords so I do not anticipate any issues.April 2014 . I ordered another one and it does n't work at all .	-1
This particular brand did n't last but about a month . Try to find another brand . Most of these are good though .	-1
Do n't recommend it does n't charge . I bought them cause they were cheap and I got what I paid for ! Not good	-1
READ UPDATE ! As always , my Apple cord shorted out and I was in need of another . This was a great , cheap , working replacement charger ! UPDATE : Literally a few hours later the cord wo n't sync to the computer . It only charges . I ca n't get around this at all . Also , the cord is very hard to get into the port and out of the port . Very cheaply made . SAVE MONEY AND BUY OTHER CABLE !	-1
The cord was not what I thought it was , and it goes in and out of a charge . As soon as it starts to charge , I can come back to my phone and it 's back to square one . The battery actually went down than charged .	-1
The materials and design are not nearly as durable as the ones that come with your phone . These are delicate and easily broken . I ordered 2 and 1 did n't work at all .	-1
I bought 20 of these , figuring if they lasted a couple months each , I 'd have years worth of cables . The ones I 've used have barely made a week . The one in my car lasted two uses ... One that I gave away lasted less than a couple hours ... I understand that these cords are provided by different companies , and some may be better than others . The company I bought from was Ships from Hong Kong . I emailed them about the issue but have not heard anything back from them . Clearly a waste of money and time . I 'm only out & lt ; $ 20 , so I 'll just consider it a cheap reminder that you get what you pay for . I have two apple cords that are still kicking after years of use , whatever they cost , I assume it 's worth the extra amount .	-1
No matter the cpu or usb 2.0 , or 3.0 , even usb plug adapter this item still non functional it tries to connect you hear & see the signs but never makes it . Went to microcenter and purchase one there.after taking it apart modifying the wiring I got it to work using lower gauge high quality copper wires .	-1
While this item looks virtually identical to the original Apple cable , my iphone 3GS tells me `` charging is not supported with this accessory '' . I do n't know how my phone can tell the difference , but it only likes to be charged with the original . I was able to use the retractable type cable for a few months before they quit working . But for this price , I ca n't complain .	-1
cord should be at least 1 m long , not 12 & # 34 ; . even a good price doesnt save this bad product . and when you call the company -it 's & # 34 ; oh we 're sorry - it 's out of stock - thats why we sent the short ones. & # 34 ;	-1
Do not buy this . It is not apple certified . Pay more and get a real cord . My dad burnt up the drive in his iPhone using non apple certified cords , so do n't risk it .	-1
I was better off buying the true product from the Apple Store in stead ... Total waste of money . Wo n't connect with many things and the stuff it does connect with it wo n't keep the charge going for long . AWFUL !	-1
These things are terrible ! At least the ones I got from `` itemsforless '' . The cord pulled out at the phone end.Come on Amazon get these `` sellers '' off the web site ! It 's getting as bad as E-bay .	-1
I waited almost 2 months for this product and when I finally got it , it did n't even work . The worst dollar ever spent . : (	-1
I bought 5 . Three did n't work right out of the package . I kinda expected that based off of reviews , that 's why I bought 5 in the first place .	-1
The price was great and the reviews were mixed . I took a chance and ordered two cables . The ends that connect to your iPhone were completely out of alignment on both cables ! I contacted seller and they thought I should try to get it to work . There was no possible way I was going to take a chance on damaging my iPhone . The seller sent two more cables and they were no better . When I contacted the seller for a refund they wanted me to return the cables . It makes no sense to spend more than the amount of the refund shipping the defective cables back to the seller ! JUST BE WARNED -- DO NOT BUY ! THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY .	-1
yes , its very very cheap , so i thought what the hell ill just buy it . The cord only worked for about a week before it randomly stopped being able to charge my phone lol dont waste ur money , it takes like a month for shipping	-1
I will never buy another cord from any of the sellers ... they break or just do n't work from the start . some claim to be Apple certified but none are !	-1
The cord took almost a month to get to me and then when I finally did get it , it did not work ! ! I guess you get what you pay for	-1
I made the mistake of purchasing this charger cord.As soon as I connected my iPhone 4 to the charger , it started to overheat and within 5 minutes , the charger and cable was burning hot.The bottom line is that the price on these chargers should ring alarm bells ! I learned my lesson.STAY AWAY and buy a genuine Apple charger instead ! The adapter , however , does NOT charge the iPhone4 . I receive & # 34 ; Charging is not supported with this accessory & # 34 ; when connecting .	-1
I only got the ipad cable I did n't receive this one ! I totally forgot about this one . I knew something was missing but did n't realize or remember what it was until I got this email .	-1
I rarely used it to begin with , but now it just wo n't even charge or work at all . It 's very frustrating .	-1
i purchased 6 of these for extra chargers in the car , office and home . Within 1 week NONE of them would work . Some quit the first time I tried using them . POOR quality and a waste of money and time.. But a better charger . I have tried contacting seller and no reply ! ! ! ! !	-1
I do n't mind buying non-Apple parts , but when they are advertised as being Apple OEM parts , and they turn out to be cheap Chinese knock-offs , then I am disappointed . I bought 3 , and they are not even uniform . Even the USB logo is on the opposite side of one plug . I had to grind them down with a nail file to make them fit a bumper on an iPhone 4 . They are ok for the price , but giving one star for selling a counterfeit instead of simply saying they are 3rd party cables .	-1
I 'm not sure if it 's apple or the actual chord but eventually the chord stops charging the Idevices , and iv'e noticed this with both my ipad and ipod . It 's says `` This device is not supported '' It took about a month fir this message to occur on both my devices but i 'm sure it 's a waste of money .	-1
I ordered two of these from the OEM For Cheap seller . Neither cord fits well - not the USB side , or the Apple side . They are hard to put in and take out and have to be forced . I 'm worried that would hurt my iPhone and MacBook Pro over time , so I 'm only going to use for emergency charging . Of the two cords , only ONE works AT ALL . It can both Sync and Charge . The other is a complete dud . I 've asked for a refund on the one that does n't work . I will update once I know how the seller handles it . *** UPDATE *** The seller handled it professionally . They sent me a new ( working ) cord and told me to recycle the bad one . Still have the same fit problems , and also I have noticed the charge time is a lot longer than my `` real '' charger . Still keeping for emergencies only .	-1
lasted one week shy of a month , now it will not charge nor connect to my phone or pc . would not waste my time or money , recommend looking else where for a more dependable cord for my iphone 4s/ had high hopes after reading reviews but alas , its not worth the time and effort to order another to risk it failing and having no means of charging my phone . got two stars because at first worked great , just buyer beware .	-1
I bought 2 chargers for my i phone 4S and after 6 months , one died.So be aware that u get what u pay for !	-1
It just wo n't fit right on the new iPad . I 've tried both purchased cables , neither one worked . If I pushed it in harder , still one side wo n't go in completely , then the other side would have hard time to pull out . So this is not a good cable for iPad . There is no problem using the original iPad USB cable .	-1
Okay so i changed my comment on this . I thought my dad said it worked , but it didnt charge my dads phone . I really disaponted : /	-1
I loved it and it worked perfectly , but only for about a month . One day it just quit working . period . no power , data , anything , and I did n't use it any differently .	-1
First time I got it , it was not working . So the company was nice and sent another . However this new one was broken as well and fell apart within seconds .	-1
In many things electronic , generic can be and often is , perfect in working great and costing considerable less . In this case that was not the case , both cables while they looked fine , were not . Plugging in to my iPod or iPhone , or iPad , the connector was very stiff to where I was concerned I might be damaging the connector part in the device . Also they would not work to charge or sync our iPads as they would never charge or connect , but they would work to charge the iPhone , iPod , and that should n't matter ! 30 pin should be 30 pin ! I had bought these as our original cables are wearing and even with these not working as good as they should , I will probably try another set as needed . With stock being about $ 30.00 each , that will buy many generics and I 'm certain I 'll find as good as stock units , just not these .	-1
First of all , the shipping took so long , I forgot I ordered them . They looked good at first , so I kind of got excited about having these extra two cables that I did n't remember ordering . When I plugged the first one in to my iPhone 4 , the connection was VERY snug . No problem right ? The sync finished , and I went to unplug , except it would n't unplug . When I used more pressure , the cable disintegrated , and we had a situation where the raw wires were coming out ( see one of the pictures in the description ) . I was worried about getting electrocuted and what not , but I eventually got the connector out of the phone using pliers.Second cable , same thing . Cable was too snug , and too cheap.These cables are absolutely worthless .	-1
they were fine for about one week and they stopped working completely . i bought the twp thinking they would work perfect for a long time , but both are now useless .	-1
It stopped working after 2 weeks , it tells me it is not compatible with my phone . Worked for only about 1 week .	-1
Bought two USB cables . Thought I 'd give it a whirl . Took a while to receive them , turns out neither of them work ... Do n't waste your time and money .	-1
Do n't even work I hate this product it stop workin after 10mins ill never buy from this company again worst money spent its dont cost a lot for a good reason cause it beyond cheap	-1
It.s hard to rate it because I have not got it yet and I do not know what the hangup is I payed my bill but no cable yet .	-1
Well , this worked well for the first charge , then it broke . The company was nice enough to send me another on ( which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 ) but the second one broke after the first charge as well.. Would not buy another from this company .	-1
Does not work . I can not synch my iPod with this . I bought this as a back up to my original but still using the original since the new one does n't work or fit properly .	-1
After a few weeks it started acting up for some odd reason and I really do n't know why ! Its frustrating too !	-1
The charging cable did arrive rather quickly and it does work , however , it is faulty . It will stop charging for no reason and a message will pop up that says `` Charging is n't supported for this device . '' So I have to disconnect the cable & put it back in to make it charge again.Also , it charges extremely slow . With a normal charging cable from Apple , I can go from 0 to 100 % in one hour . This generic cable takes several hours to charge my phone . It 's extremely annoying and inconvenient.You get what you pay for , so for a dollar and some change , the cable will have to do . It 's good enough for now .	-1
THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY . IT DID N'T EVEN WORK ON ANY OF OUR IPADS . WE SENT IT BACK . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PURCHASING THIS	-1
This was super bad.It did n't charge my iPod at all in fact none of my i devices.It actually scared me to plug it up because it made my iPod n iPad say weird things .	-1
I use it a couple of time till it broke . They need make it where it last longer than it should .	-1
This cord takes about twice as long to charge my iPad 2 in comparison to my OEM cable . This is frustrating when you charge the tablet overnight and wake up with only an 80 % charge . I have also noticed that if I am charging the iPad while using it , the battery actually still drains . This cable will not charge the battery ( even though it indicates it is ) , or even maintain it 's current charge , if you are using the tablet . I gave the product more than one star only because it will charge the tablet , albeit over a long period of time of non-use . ***UPDATE***I just noticed the product description says `` For Apple iPhone , iPod Sync data or charging '' . I honestly ca n't recall if the description mentioned iPad compatibility when I purchased it some time ago , but perhaps this cable works better for the smaller devices . It is still disappointing that it does n't work well with the iPad considering that I can use my iPod cable interchangeably with my iPad and get the same charge results . In any event , I am leaving my two star rating so that others considering this product for their tablets understand the cons associated with it .	-1
I 'm not sure why this is called a charging cable , it does not work as such . We did n't get it for about 8 weeks after ordering and ended up getting a refund , but it did n't matter about the money , the wait time was frustrating ( we obviously ordered it for a reason , we needed it ) . After all that waiting it did n't work . Do n't waste your time or your dollar .	-1
I figured for the price it was to good to be true and it was ! got it and it didnt even work on an iphone or ipod .	-1
Hi this product is kinda the same when it comes to the looks of it but I get error message whie using it with my iphone SOMETIMES.I wish that was not the case because the price and the shipping was great .	-1
It works but is not solid and broke very quickly after a few uses , I would n't buy again for sure .	-1
Bought it then it stopp working . Did n't have it for long . Kinda disappointed so just ought one from the apple store	-1
This is advertized as a data transfer cable and guess what it works to transfer data . If you think since it looks exactly like the $ 30 cable from Apple it will also charge your iphone ... .IT WO N'T .	-1
Out of the 5 chargers I gnly 2 of them were working I was really dissapointed and upset that they did n't work ) - ;	-1
these are cheap , cheap cheap in all aspects . looks like the originals at first , but after a month or two the cable joints start coming off , exposing the inner wires at the junction of the wire and the plugs .	-1
Broke instantly ! Not worth my money ! I 'm tired of waisting my money on these ! Nothing like the original ! : ( : (	-1
This works SOMETIMESHowever , most of the time , it refuses to charge and even overheats your device . Simply do not buy this piece of shit , spend a dollar or more and get a brand that knows what they are doing	-1
The cord does not work for long , it already has a shortage and is not working at all NOT COOL OR A GOOD PRODUCT ! ! ! !	-1
THIS CHARGER WAS HORRIBLE , THE WIRES STARTED SHOWING AFTER 1 DAY AND SOMETIMES I HAVE TO PLUG AND UNPLUG MY IPHONE MULTIPLE TIMES BECAUSE I GET A MESSAGE THAT SAYS THIS ITEM IS NOT SUPPORT BY IPHONE . ITS EXTREMEMLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE ITS ALREADY FALLING AND APART AND BARELY CHARGES MY PHONE . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING .	-1
I guess you get what you pay for . Attempted to disconnect my charging iPhone from this cable and it snapped apart .	-1
This item is not even worth your time ... Please take my advice and keep scrolling pass this or you will be disappointed for purchasing .	-1
stop working after 2 weeks time.. pls dont waste your time . this product is cheap and it no longer works	-1
this product was ok but when i got it the cord got lose i guess and i was already able to see the wire . the cords where a little shaky but it was ok overall .	-1
The product was very cheaply made . You can tell by how it feels . It does not even feel like a regular iPod cable . It does not charge my device well at all . I bought a few so I could stick one at work and have a few backups but it appears as though they are practically useless . Do n't waste your money .	-1
it is tight for i phone . u have to push hard and pull hard . I stopped using , may damage i phone pins . Dont want to risk $ 599 to save $ 7	-1
Item was ordered from Boho Tronics ( $ 2.75 ) . It is not an Apple product but a knockoff or possibly a reject . It took almost 3 weeks to come . It does n't work . Wo n't sync or charge my iPod Touch . I reordered it from PriceMasters ( $ 3.19 ) . After reordering I realized that this may also turn out to be a knockoff or reject . I 'll wait and see . Possibly this vendor is the same as the first ( different name ) or vendors use the same knockoff supplier . It 's inconceivable that an real Apple cable ( $ 19.00 ) could be sold for $ 2.75.Amazon should not allow the device to be described as `` by Apple '' if it 's not by Apple. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This a follow up to the above.The order from PriceMasters ( $ 3.19 ) arrived today . This one does n't even fit into my iPod Touch . I wo n't force it for fear of damaging the unit.Save your money and try one from Griffin ( $ 14.15 ) [ ... ] At least you can return it to Amazon for a refund.or still betterspend the full $ 19.00 and go directly to Apple .	-1
Used for one week ( if that ) and thought it was great , but now it will not charge any of my apple products . It is garbage .	-1
This is a piece of junk do not waste your time or money . Not sure how they got away with selling this garbage !	-1
These just do not last long.although it arrived on time once we used it it didnt take long to discover how bad it sucked.I would NEVER order these again !	-1
This only worked for a few times to charge my iphone . Then I stopped working and would not charge my phone .	-1
The cable 's external insulation separated from the connectors , on both sides of the cable ( phone-end and Mac-end ) , within one week . That left the internal wires exposed . Junk , junk , cheap junk .	-1
I received the cable when/how described . But , when I pluged the cable into my computer to charge my phone , then unpluged it . The uSB portion of the cable , stayed in the computer ! Never again !	-1
The charger worked perfectly fine for about 3 days , Then you had to out it in a certain position . After about a two weeks , it stopped working . DO NOT BUY WASTE OF MONEY	-1
The same day I got this I was using it to charge my grandsons iPad and it fell a part the end that plugs into the iPad came apart will not buy anymore from this sealer they are cheap made not worth the money it was a waste sorry .	-1
this cable does work , however the material it is made of it of very poor quality . then end where it connects to the phone rips very easily.and also , the end that connects to the phone is a little thicker than the Apple cable . you have to wiggle the cable out when it 's plugged in because it does n't slide out as well as the Apple cable . you 're better off spending a little more and buying a genuine Apple cable . it will last you a lot longer..	-1
I bought 3 of these and 2 broke within weeks . They were so cheap it was n't worth driving to the post office and paying return postage to return them , so I just called it a loss . Maybe a good buy if you need a charger you could lose or damage for a camping trip or something .	-1
Do n't buy it . The cord is no longer than the Apple one , the seller lies and say 's it is , and it has syncing problems .	-1
My iPhone cable needed to be replaced because the wires were exposed . I noticed it starting to come apart a few days ago and decided to order this one . I was relieved when I received it today because this cable really should be thrown out and replaced . I 'm afraid of a fire or something . When I plugged it in , I was very disappointed to find that it did n't charge my phone . I tried a different outlet and then I tried the USB port on my laptop . Nothing worked . Sending it back to Amazon but have to find one at a store so I can continue charging my phone .	-1
I 'm very disappointed with this because the product seemed to charge the phone but after a few minutes multiple times my phone restarted . I 'm very disappointed mainly because I really do n't want to spend $ 19 for a replacement charger . Waste of time and money.This is an additional review to the item . My actually APPLE Charger has basically kicked the bucket and in desperation I plugged in this charger to see what it can do and if maybe cutting my phone off was a short habit . Turns out , the charger works great and also does n't cut my phone off anymore . I 'm very pleased.UPDATE : Aug. 12 , 2011 . This cord has stopped working . It barely even shorts out . It just does n't work like it 's supposed to . So I 'm out of luck until I find ANOTHER one . I really do n't want to by the Apple cord but that may be in works for me .	-1
Great charger for the first day and then it broke the next day which sucked because I really needed that charger because my other one broke !	-1
Stopped working after a week , but I guess the price suits it well ... I paid $ 1 for it and was going to use it as a car charger adapter , but that was to no avail .	-1
Every iphone connector seems to break or the wires will comeout within a month or two and i 'll have to buy another one for like $ 5 or less , they all suck .	-1
I purchased this cable through Nathan Norris . Please , please please save yourself the money and DO NOT buy this cable . Mine stopped working after having it just a little over a month . Unfortunately , I 'm now outside the timeframe for returns and I 'm stuck with a USB cable that 's completely useless.Save your money , do n't buy !	-1
Beware who you buy from , as there are many vendors out there , all whom seem to have some version or another.I ordered this from one of the vendors and the vendor actually sent me an older style , which had the release clasps ( for old ipod classics and video ) , it 'll work , however , it WAS NOT what I ordered , and another thing I learned from studying this connector : It 's of shoddy quality ... The center ground blades on the Apple 's Proprietary-side , was coming apart , my point ? Look , you probably spent $ 300+ on your iPod Touch or iPhone , why cheap-out on a shoddy cable and have the possibility of ruining the connector ? Connector 101 - It takes two connectors to mate , but only one to destroy the mate . I 've decided to just fork over the dough to Apple and get a genuine one , at least that 's made to tolerance and is good.Buying from various sellers on here is a random crap-shoot , cheaping out and buying these knock-offs will have the chance of destroying your little mobile investment ... I would stay far away from these . I 've learned my lesson , luckily , the vendor gave me a full refund ( $ 1.50 woohoo ! ) , that being said , the vendor probably knows that his/her products are questionable at best ...	-1
at first the cable seem to work well but in a short period of time they quit working ... after taking apart I see why . The solder connections are horrible ... really surprised about the poor connection . Like the cheap cost but charge a bit more and do the cables right .	-1
These are inexpensive and barely work . I was attracted by the price but they are tough to make function with my kids phones .	-1
it is work at the first 30 days , I brought two , one of it was broken , the line disconnect after 20daysthe other one works ok in the first couple times , after 30 days it still looks prefect , but suddenly when I plug into the pc , nothing shows up , and it became not working1 dollar for 20 days , it depends on how u thinkI will never buy it , cause it might not work suddenly when u really need to charge ur iphonethos was my previous reviewFvery nice price , works very well.I buy two more after I got it . the usb is very good also fast shiping	-1
connections poor and tight fit . hard to connect and disconnect . sometimes it works to play music from iphone and others it does not . will always charge it . never have this problem with other wires . would not buy this again .	-1
After waiting 3 weeks for this to arrive , we discovered that it did NOT work . Not only that , but sparks were coming out of it ! Not only this is thing a complete piece of garbage , but it 's also dangerous . We 're just lucky there was no damage to the iPhone . Consider yourself warned . Pay a little more so you wo n't have to worry about this burning your house down .	-1
I purchased 2 of these USB cords . One of the iPhones ( my Moms phone ) is a 3GS and the cord will not charge it . I get a message on the screen that says `` Charging is not supported with this accessory '' with a yellow warning triangle . Also , you do not get the lightening bolt on the battery icon to indicate that it is charging . Perhaps this cord is defective . I 'm wondering if these cords compatible with the iPhone 3GS . I have the iPhone 4 and it seems to work with that . I have n't tried it in my iPad yet , but if there is an issue , I will update this . I sent a email to the seller to see what can be done . I am not paying for shipping it back when it only costs me $ 1 . Hopefully they will make good and send me a replacement without me sending this one back .	-1
This is a dollar store item and it 's his junk instead of waiting two months for it to arrive you can go to your local dollar store and buy it there but even there you will be buying junk you just have to go to the Apple Store to get quality .	-1
I bought this as a replacement but it did n't fit my IPhone 3GS at all . I plugged it into my phone and it would not come out . Once it was in there it did n't charge it but it charged my iPod . Now I 'm having problems with IPod all together . I suggest you do a little more browsing before you settle for this product . I guess I got what I paid for .	-1
Looks like original iPhone charge cable.If you want a cable as a spare to carry around in your gym bag or laptop bag , go ahead and buy it.It *might* charge your iPad when it 's new , but it will stop charging after a month or so.It may continue charging iPhone/iPod till it breaks down.My recommendation : Buy 1 ) Amazon basics iPhone cable or 2 ) Buy an used genuine Apple iPhone charge cable from EBay or 3 ) buy from Apple .	-1
They do n't work for your iPod they brake fast and you struggle to put it in would n't recommend this product to you guys	-1
Worked for 3 days then never worked again . Was very disappointed with this product . Would not recommend to anyone at all .	-1
I have always been a proponent of Bluetooth headset use , especially when talking on the cellphone and driving at the same time . I think it is unfortunate that certain people consider using bluetooth to be uncool and somehow associated with a rather hateful stereotypical image of a Hummer-driving yuppie . If you 're driving and talking , GET a Bluetooth headset ! I would rather see people driving around on the road like they are telephone tech supports than blind and distracted zombies . That ends my rant on why I believe everyone should be using a wireless headset . Now let 's talk about this Plantronics Discovery 925 Bluetooth.I 've gone through a few Bluetooth headsets in the past few years - mostly Motorola and Jarba models priced around 20 bucks . I had absolutely no complaints regarding these economy models . When I received this 150 dollars headset ( ! ) in the mail , I was seriously expecting to be awed and shocked with a level of performance , feature , and luxury I had previous unexperienced.The unboxing and setup process was pretty straight forward . One fancy feature that is indeed very useful is that a leather carrying pouch was included , and it is n't just any plain leather pouch either . The carrying pouch , in fact , has a built-in battery . When the headset is stored inside the pouch , you can plug in the charging cable and charge both the headset and the charging pouch . So later on , when you 're on the road , you in fact have two batteries ready to be used which greatly extends the hours of use between charging . Unfortunately , the charging carrying case is the only positive thing I can say about this headset.According to the manual and the packaging , the headset supposed to have some fancy audio-processing logic which will make the phone conversation crystal clear . Alas , it was not the case . Once I got the headset bonded with my Verizon KRZR phone and made a test call to my wife , the voice sounded rather dull , down-sampled , and somewhat metallic . This is unacceptable for a 150 BT headset ! I can honestly say , in term of voice clarity , all my previous 20-buck Motorola/Jarba outperformed this ridiculously overpriced headset by far . I have not tried the headset with any other cell phones . But a Motorola KRZR is a rather common handset , and Plantronics 925 gave me quite a let-down.In conclusion , I will not recommend this headset to anyone at its current price . If it was around $ 30 - $ 40 ( currently Amazon is already offering at 50 % off the original listing price ) , and only if looks/design is more important to you than voice clarity , perhaps only then I will recommend it to you.Sorry Plantronics , I honestly , genuinely wanted to love this headset . But for the time being , I 'm going back to my 20 dollar Jarba .	-1
I purchased the gold version of this unit for my wife because it was rated so highly , looked great , and had lots of excellent features , especially the fact that you could charge the case that held the unit and the case , in turn , could extend the charge of the unit itself . Also , the price was great at only $ 39.99 at the time . The unit was pretty comfortable for me , but did not fit her well because my wife 's ear canal is shallow and the ear pads of the unit are designed for a deeper ear canal . She prefers one that hooks securely around the ear . Anyway , when I plugged it in to charge it for the first time , I noticed that the charger power light lit up green as soon as I plugged it in , but the light went out as soon as I plugged the charger into the unit or the case for the unit . Since the directions indicate that all lights turn off when the unit was fully charged , I assumed that was the case . However , after pairing it with the phone , I immediately heard it signalling that the battery was almost dead . But when I tried to charge it , the charger , once again , shut down when it was plugged into unit or unit case . I have returned the unit and decided not to rebuy the same thing . I will continue to search for a better blue tooth unit .	-1
Something went wrong with my earpiece after maybe 6 months if that . The charger would n't charge it anymore . I tried changing chargers , cords and outlets and nothing would work . Neither would the little charging case that came with it . So , now I 'm in the hole after an expensive purchase let me down .	-1
I really do n't have a clue how they can say this comes with three different sized ear buds . The buds were so close in size the I could barely tell the difference . I tried all three of them , not a single one was small enough for my ear and none of them would actually be considered to be an `` in-ear '' ear bud for me . It was also not a simple chore to swap them out . I also learned my lesson ( which I suspected anyway ) I can not use a headset that does n't have something that goes over the ear to help hold it on my head . The case is actually pretty stupendous , though . Would love it if all headsets came in a case like this one .	-1
[ Was Five Stars , Now Two ] I have to admit that I have not always been an admirer of the venerable and ever-present Bluetooth headset . I have silently cursed at those whose self-importance required they stare off into space while conversing with some unseen counterpart . Another problem I felt was with the gigantic bug perched on the speaker 's ear -- it looked simply awful.The Plantronics Discovery 925 headset promised to buck the trend , not of speaking with the non-present but of drastically trimming and streamlining the size of that bug on the ear . As I needed a way to speak on my cell phone without encumbering my hand , I believed I needed to accept the inevitable and get one.First , I was surprised by how truly small the Discovery is ! No longer does it feel like a crawling cockroach has gone to sleep on the ear but the tasteful design is , as the product brochure says , fashion-forward . It is light and sleek and even better , no flashing blue light broadcasting like a lighthouse either.Second and more surprising was how easy it was to setup . The adequate manual instructed that my cell phone needed to be in discovery mode and also what to do to achieve a pairing between the headset and the phone . I achieved this step rather quickly and easily.It was a bit difficult to know what steps to take next as I needed to focus on how to get it working after the initial pairing . I quickly discovered that through a confusing series of beeps , lengthy button pushes ( the 925 has just one ) , and blinking lights of different colors , the headset is able to make and receive calls . A more careful reading of the manual showed me the error of my usual way of jumping into using electronics : after that , it was easy to know what beep meant what and what one or more colored blinks signified . Lesson : read the manual.The Plantronics came encased in a very nice carrying case which doubles as a recharging station . In other words , the case houses a battery which charges the headset if cradled . It also came with two ways of charging : a direct connection to a power outlet or a USB cable for computer recharging . Very convenient.The clarity is superb and I 've never had a problem understanding any phone calls . The headset is lodged into the ear lobe with the help of a soft Silicone ( at least I think its Silicone ) wedge which I thought would be uncomfortable at best . It was n't and turned out to be actually pleasant.I can find absolutely nothing wrong with the Plantronics Discovery . For approximately $ 120 , I would hope not anyway , but I find its ease-of-use and setup to be so enjoyable that I heartily recommend it . I did wish the manual were a tad larger and easier to read , and the user has to be really careful as I can see how easy it would be to break the headset but that 's a small quibble for a phenomenal product . I guess I have walked into the light , the blue light . **UPDATE** January 28 , 2010Within 6 months , the microphone on the unit checked out and I now have an expensive paperweight . I 'm downgrading this review from five stars to two stars .	-1
it 's a shame that Plantronics or any other Bluetooth vendor barely tests their products or just makes a product and they send it out into the world hoping that quantity sales makes their products seem as if they are quality products . What they do n't realize is that bad reviews will eventually catch up . I was standing at BestBuy and talking to someone who said `` I 've tried almost all of them and they are n't worth it . '' I would agree with that , I 've yet to try a Bluetooth headset that is worth buying and this one is no exception.In terms of performance this one is not very good because it picks up ALL background noises , despite it claims to do the opposite .	-1
This is one of the worst Bluetooths I 've had . I thought I 'd try it for the price but as the saying goes , & # 34 ; You get what you pay for & # 34 ; .	-1
I bought this to match my car , however as soon as it was out of the warranty from amazon , it broke . I had to contact the manufacturer and it was going to cost me over twenty dollars to send it to them and then I had to wait 6-8 weeks for it to return or one that is of the same value . Which they could not guaranty would be gold . So , I have it here somewhere for me to look at occasionally : (	-1
I 've had this earpiece for a month now and am very disappointed with it . Yes , it looks sleek and neat - and I was very happy with my prior Plantronics Voyager 510 headset , BUT -It is one of the most uncomfortable earpieces I 've ever had . I was just on a call of 28 minutes and my ear hurts . I can not put the unit back on my ear now because of the pain it causes . I 've tried adjusting the gel , tried different gels , but ca n't find any combination that does n't hurt my ear after being on for a moderate period of time.The instructions that come with the unit are sparse and inadequate.And the unit itself is `` fragile '' - mine will already need to be exchanged/warranty returned : now , when I put any pressure on it ( pushing it in my ear , or pushing the control button , or even touching it ) it starts making a horrible static-y , tone-y loud background noise . Sometimes the noise stops when the finger is moved away - other times it stays and I have to switch to using the handset because it 's impossible to hear the caller with the added interference.There are a couple of good points for this product , though:1 ) The sound going into the mic is fed back to the earpiece - So , for example , if it 's windy you 'll know whether you 're sending wind noise to the caller . When I 'm riding my bike , I find that I can turn my head slightly and eliminate/substantially reduce wind noise . With a headset that does n't feedback your audio , you have no idea of the noise you are sending.2 ) The leather carrycase/charger is nice esp since I would n't wear any bluetooth all the time . It protects the unit and makes it easy to put in a pocket . HOWEVER - it is NOT easy to seat into the charging plug , and I think that the case being a charger may reduce the life of the internal battery of the earpiece when it is frequently moved in and out of the case ( and consequently frequently partially charged/discharged ) .The discomfort and poor performance/durability makes me regret the purchase .	-1
This is a very well designed unit for placement in my ear - multiple choices on ear piece to fit ear size , and great sound . As I wear glasses , the over the ear type was not very comfortable . However , the darned 925 's keep failing . I 'm returning my 3rd one and frankly I 'm fed up with it . Plantronics is fantastic in their acceptance of returns through their on-line process , and they even will give me a Voyager 520 instead of replacing `` again '' the Discovery 925 I 'm returning . I really do n't recommend it for the reason that it 's unrealiable and I have to wait for a replacement using the old wire connected ear pieces . Very disappointing .	-1
Let me start by saying I LOVE Plantronics products . Years ago when I used to sell electronics I would always push their products ( I did not receive a commission ) because they were far superior in sound quality than any other brand out there . I am the type of person who will spend extra money on something that works well as opposed to something cheap that is not up to the same level of quality . Here is my review of each aspect of the product : Size/Weight : First , this product is very very light weight . When I first took the headset out of the package and held it I thought it was `` cheap '' feeling because it was so light but after thinking about it for a moment I realized I would much rather have it feel light and cheap than heavy and weighing down my ear . Overall I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset.Comfort : The weight of the product and the gel-ish inserts made the product fit comfortably in my ear . I wore the product for lengthy periods and never felt any significant level of discomfort . Overall I am impressed by the aspect of this headset.Style : First , I do not rock a fanny pack for a reason and in my opinion most Bluetooth headsets remind me of fanny packs and black socks with sandals . They are a fashion `` oh heck no . '' However , this particular headset is a nice inconspicuous size . The gap between the two bars that make up the mouthpiece make the headset look better and less bulky . Additionally , the mouthpiece is fairly short and does not overtake your face as you talk . Overall , I am extremely happy with this aspect of the headset as I do not want to look like something out of a SciFi movie when chatting on the phone.Syncing with my Bluetooth device : I have never synced any Bluetooth device to my current cell phone . The process took under 30 seconds before they were paired together . The instructions were crystal clear and I did not need my phone 's manual to figure anything out . This aspect of the headset worked amazing.And here 's where it all went wrong ... Sound Quality ( Outgoing ) : Let me start by saying , yes , I did have the mouthpiece directed in the way indicated by the Plantronics manual . Also , my phone was sitting right next to me so this was not a matter of being too far away from my cell phone . I spoke to dozens of people on the headset over the course of five days , all of whom asked , `` What was that ? Could you repeat that ? Huh ? etc . '' Most of the time I would have to disconnect the headset and go `` old-fashioned '' by actually using my hands . When I needed to put the air conditioning on , it was impossible for the other party to hear me due to the wind noise so I had to shut my vents so I could be ( somewhat ) heard . Even when there was no background noise of any sort ( music , airconditioning , passenger noise ) , the product failed in this area . Every person I spoke to complained . Overall , I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.Sound Quality ( Incoming ) : Everyone I spoke to sounded distant , unclear , and not loud enough to hear well ( yes , ALL volumes were at the maximum level ) . Often I would try to shove the headset deeper in my ear hoping it would help , however , this would cause me to accidentally hit the `` call end '' button and hang up on the person I was speaking to . After two times of doing that I learned my lesson and just strained to hear the best I could . Overall , I would rate this aspect of the headset almost unusable.One star is the minimum Amazon lets a user rate a product . I gave the rating one extra star because , had the outgoing/incoming quality been excellent , there would be no better Bluetooth product on the market right now because of size , weight , comfort , style , and ease of syncing .	-1
I had this bluetooth for four days . It worked perfect , paired easily , and sounded great.Then all of a sudden , it just stopped working . It would n't recharge , would n't turn on ... it did nothing .	-1
The headsetrelies entriely on sticking in hour ear ; there is nothing aroundthe earlobe or the head to stabilize it.A stiff wind or a yawn can easilty make it fall . To carry it in yoour pocket you have two choices . Putit in the leather box with is bulky for most pockets but carries an auxiliry battery , The other choice is to carry it loose in the pocket . When you do that latter it comes on just from getting joggled in the pocket . If you loose the outer box they get you 2/3s of the price of the whole unit to replace it . I am now looking for anoterheadset with a looparond the earlobe and a more positive off switch .	-1
FIRST I READ THE REVIEWS OF BOTH THE M1100 AND THE 925 BY PLANTRONICS . I BELIEVE ALL THOSE 5 STAR REVIEWS ARE FAKE . AND FOR ME AND AMAZON . IF I SEE OVER 5 BAD REVIEWS THEN ITS A BAD DEVICE COMING FROM AMAZON.. I bought the M1100 first it was full of static during my conversation . I sent it back the same day i bought it.. Amazon gave me a gift card for a refund . so i ordered the 925 . THIS ONE WAS WORST THEN THE M1100 . THIS BLUETOOTH HOLD STATIC WITHOUT BEING ON THE PHONE . I JUST GOT IT IN LIKE FIVE MINUTES AGO . I WILL ALSO BE SENDING THIS ONE BACK ... .. EVERYONE IS GROWN SO YOU ALL ARE GOING TO DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO . ALL IM SAYING IS DONT BE DUMB AND WASTE A LOT OF TIME ... .. THE REVIEWS HAVE TO BE FAKE ... I ORDERED BOTH THE M1100 AND THE 925 PLANTRONICS.. IF YOU LOVE STATIC IN YOUR EAR THEN THESE TWO ARE FOR YOU ... .	-1
When I plugged it into my computer , the whole computer turned off . When it powered on , I received this message from the BIOS : `` USB device over current status detected '' and it shutdown after 15 seconds . I 'm running a self-built computer with an over 900W power supply , and I only had 1 other USB device connected.Out of curiosity , I tried it in another USB port ( on the back ) - same result . Also , the same result in my Toshiba laptop . I also tried it in a USB wall charger I have , and it produced an electric arc . Obviously , it does n't work . I 'm just glad it did n't damage any of my hardware.See if you can find a better quality product - this one is junk .	-1
I purchased this cable so that I could connect my cell phone ( LG CU515 ) to my computer and download pictures from it . The cable itself works fine . However , be aware that it wo n't do any good to have this cable if you also do n't have software to take the pictures , music , etc . from your phone and transfer it to your computer . I 'm unfamiliar with the technological lingo , but apparently without such software your phone and computer ca n't talk to each other . The cable includes software , but it comes on a mini-disc that does n't work without an adapter or a computer that will specifically read & load mini-discs . So , the cable itself is great , but it 's virtually worthless ( and probably the reason for the incredibly cheap price ) without proper software .	-1
The battery arrived within the time frame for shipping and was well packaged.The first visible difference between this and the original is that the cell for this one was made in China ; the original was made in Korea.The original was solid , while this one had a seam around the bottom , and one could see some of the battery 's contents starting to leak there already . The manufacture code of DC061128 ( November 28 , 2006 ) means that the battery is over 5 years old.The battery did come with a full charge , but a battery that 's already leaking is n't going to be used in my phone . Since the cost was nominal , it 's not worth bothering to return it.Rating : D	-1
This headset does not cancel outside sound . It also is n't very loud and broke broke a couple days after I got it . Very cheaply made !	-1
Update : As other reviews state - the thing will snap in 2 with normal use . DO N'T BUY THIS ! While it sounds great , it will break with normal use after a short while . Samsung 's `` warranty '' does n't cover the obviously defective design - well , someone should sue them because the language in the written warranty covers DEFECTS and this surely is a defect if you see how many people have had this problem ! Since Samsung wo n't stand behind it - I 'm boycotting ALL Samsung products - there you go ! And , here 's what I did to `` repair '' them : Gorilla Glue : this is really good glueA piece of flexible metal - looked around my parts box and found some sort of bracket - strip of thing metal , and I cut it as it was a bit big . Bent it to cover the top and bottom of the band and gorilla-glued it . After 24hrs , put black duct tape around the repair job and it 's lasted several months . I actually cut off a small part of the broken band near where it snapped because I have a thin face and wanted a slightly tighter/snugger fit - and that 's what I 've got now.The headphones are still uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour or so as others have said as they dig into the ears , but I do like them for the gym and around the home as a bluetooth headset for voice calls with my phone . Just ca n't wear them for more than hour at a time. [ Final ? ] Update - Sep 2010 : They keep breaking in new places . After the sixth break in the headband today , I 've given up trying to repair it . So , I found a pair of headphones that I no longer use ( traditional over-the-head band ) , and took the earpieces off . Used Gorilla Glue to blue the Samsung earpieces on . Now , the fit and comfort issues are gone - and they wo n't break again either . But , the cable between the 2 earpieces is n't long enough - so , right now I put that behind my head ... I am thinking of cutting the wire in 2 , and splicing/sodering a piece of cable in so they can go around the band over-the-head - altho will require some skill as the wires inside the cable are very very thin .	-1
Units - 2 of them- would not sync or work with any of my laptops . Returned them via Amazon printed UPS label over 7 weeks ago . Still wating on a refund . Amazon says they cant refund the charge , only the merchant.Guess , I will have to file a dispute with AMX .	-1
It appears this phone is being sold as a new phone when it fact I believe it 's been refurbished . Opened box to find a phone that had different colored part in blue . The back and flip portion of phone was a different blue from rest of phone . Also phone was just bouncing around loose in box - no internal packing . Back piece of phone along with battery and charger were also loose in box . The phone was not the quality as advertised .	-1
DONT BUY IT . WASTE OF YOUR MONEY . The back cover kept coming out . I did not know what to do so I sent it back but never got the money back . What a waste of my time and money .	-1
I used to have this phone long time ago , I bought this for my dad , but the only problem I had is its hard to hear when you call someone over the phone I cant hear them . its ok for the people like basic cell phone .	-1
Nice looking phone.If the phone has any problems , the motorola agents are unavailable to help in any way except to offer to maybe repair it if sent in , for more than the cost of an unlocked version.Find a company that supports its products , that either is number one , or wants to be . If you want an android , there are several companies that are HUNGRY for your biz . Motorola is not .	-1
RECIEVED ON TIME BACK COVER WAS BROKEN ASKED FOR ANOTHER ONE AND THEY SENT ME A PINK COVER SERIOUSLY WTH THE THE HONE IT SELF STOP WORKING WITHIN A FEW WEEKS HORRIBLE DONT WWASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ITH THESE PEOPLE VERY UNPROFESSIONAL .	-1
My mom missed having a RAZR phone and I got this for her . But , when I got it I was excited but after opening it I realized how cheaply put together it was and it just felt so brittle in my hands . I do n't recommend this unless you like having a crappy cheap phone or just for a backup .	-1
I am going to return phone it will not stay charged for more than an hour , that 's the only problem so far but unable to use for extended time to see if there are any other issues .	-1
I used to have this phone long time ago , I bought this for my uncle , but the only problem I had is its hard to hear when you call someone over the phone I cant hear them . its ok for the people like basic cell phone .	-1
I 've used many iGo products and this is the first one to disappoint . It does n't fit in the 12v outlet ( cigarette lighter ) as well as it should and it comes loose all the time . So my devices run out of charge when I think they 've been charging.So this product fails at it 's one purpose : to charge stuff.I still love iGo products and I 'm still very happy with the other iGo 12v chargers I own -- just not this one .	-1
These are better than basic normal earbuds , but if you play anything with bass , the sound gets overblown and distorted . Highs and mid-range are good , however , so if you do n't listen to very thumpy music , these will sound fairly good.The noise-reducing capability was kind of a disappointment ; it is n't as good as I had hoped for . I can easily hear the people around me talking and make out their conversations , even when the earphones make a very good seal in my ears.To anyone who has troubles getting a good seal : you can follow the usual steps below for putting earplugs in.1 . Hold the earplug in your right hand.2 . With your left hand , reach over or behind your head and grip the top of your right ear , pulling upward while you open your jaw slightly.3 . Put the earphone in , then let go of your ear.4 . Swap sides and put in the left earplug.You might look a little silly when doing it , but it will give you a much tighter seal . Once you get the idea down , you will be able to do it all with one hand ( e.g. , use a couple fingers in your right hand to pull up on your right ear while lowering your jaw and using your index finger and thumb to push the right earphone into your ear ) .These would be okay for twenty-five bucks or less , but not seventy.Update : after 3 years of occasional light use ( avg less than once a month ) , the right earbud stopped working . I never did get them to stay in 100 % reliably , even by inserting them earplug-style . I usually had to stop 3 or 4 times to re-insert them when mowing the lawn .	-1
If you check my reviews on Amazon.com , I have hundreds . Not ONE of them , despite my traumatic experiences with a few , have ever received one star.That 's changing today.I just received the stylus and was stoked to try it on Sketchbook Mobile . As soon as I turned on my iPhone I though , `` What the heck ; let 's try it on the menu screen to navigate to the app . '' I pushed the stylus gently , and nothing work . I pushed a little harder , and that seemed to get the iPhone working . I opened Sketchbook , but nothing happened . I pressed harder , and still nothing . I then pushed even harder and tried to draw , and the stupid stylus scratched my screen . It 's a little nick on my screen protector , so I 'm not too worried.I did read that you have to push harder to get it working if you have a screen protector , but I pushed all the way and no result was shown.I 'm returning the stylus a.s.a.p . to Amazon.com.My guess is that this will be my only one-star review -- ever . I read the others precautionary reviews , but thought I was the exception.I was wrong .	-1
I bought this thing assuming it would work on all capacitive screens . Apparently that was a misguided assumption on my part . I attempted to use it on a Viewsonic gTablet . There is no way I can get this thing to drag a screen shot up , down or sideways . I have a RooCase ultra mini which works really great . I wanted something a tad larger than the RooCase , that 's is why I ordered this thing . Bad decision .	-1
This stylus is very cheap quality and you have press harder on the screen to use it with an iphone or ipod . You get what you pay.Do n't waste your time and money .	-1
After I ordered the Pogo stylus , I learned from several Youtube videos that you can build these yourself for pennies . So while the Pogo was on its way to me , I did just that . The review of the Pogo follows , but I need to mention the do-it-yourself version first . Being an Engineer , I happened to have a bunch of the carbon foam that micro-chips are shipped in , which is the exact same material the Pogo uses.If you hold the foam and brush it against your iPhone , iPad , etc , it works beautifully . So I tried shaping a piece of the foam into a ball and attached it to the end of a plastic pen . It did n't work . No movement at all from the cursor . You see , the foam completes an electrical circuit between your body and the touchscreen , which is why the barrel of the Pogo is metal.On Youtube , I saw various methods for creating a metal barrrel . The most intresting is to use a segment of a telescoping antenna . The only thing I had lying around was an X-acto knife , so I unscrewed and removed the blade from the barrel , and stuffed the foam inside the barrel hole . Viola ! It stays in place perfectly , and I was able to shape the foam tip into a rounded ball.Now , the reason I mention all of this is NOT to share my arts and crafts skill . When I got my Pogo , I noticed that I had to push it really hard against the screen to get a consistent response . If you lightly brush it , it will NOT respond well . Others have said the same thing.However , my homemade version with the X-acto barrel works like a champ . Very light touches work consistently . I wonder if the brushed finish of the Pogo has any coating that is acting as an insulator . The X-acto barrel is pure , cold metal , and I imagine it is a much better conductor.So , even not comparing the Pogo to my home-made version , I find the Pogo to be not worth the money . it requires too hard of a contact for my comfort . I know that eventually the foam tip will lose its spring-feel and I would be scraping the metal of the Pogo barrel against my iPhone.The idea behind the product is great . Hopefully , Pogo will come out with a version that has a better conducting barrel . Until then , I highly recommend going to Radio Shack , and buying the cheapest IC they have - just for the packing material . Make your own stylus , and I bet yours will work better than the Pogo , too .	-1
This was supposed to work with my phone , but it does n't . Do not purchase this product if you have an LG GU295 slider phone . It may be cheap and uses micro usb but it wont work with the phone .	-1
Do not buy . Threw ours away . It overheats when plugged in to the point where it is hard to touch it .	-1
The cable itself works , but the entire point of buying a retractable cable is that , well , it retracts . The cable rarely retracts on its own , you have to push the button , pull and release a bunch of times until most of it retracts , and then tap on the charger repeatedly to unbind the spring inside so it will retract the rest of the cable . I wo n't be buying this brand again .	-1
I loved everthing about this headset until it stopped working less than 3 weeks after I received it . I am very disappointed because I threw away the box and now I have nothing . When it worked , it was fantastic and stylish . Very disappointed .	-1
This headset was purchased for my wife . The biggest problem with it was that after a few months , It would n't hold a charge . We tried everything to get it to work right , but to no avail . We finally gave up & just disposed of it .	-1
These suck . Pure and simple . The reason is that they are terribly uncomfortable and unbalanced . Forget wearing them for day to day use because if you have a collar ... whether it be a shirt or jacket or whatever , these will drive you nutz . You will walk around like a zombie trying not to knock the back . Always wear t-shirts ? Yea , maybe they 'll work , but even when they 're not knocking around ur collar , they are still uncomfortable with the imbalance of weight . Maybe they 're work well for the gym , but other reviews say the slightest amount of sweat or water will destroy them ... i dunno about that because i never got past the first day or two . Buy at ur own risk ... but i would wait . They seem to be almost there , but not quite yet with this product .	-1
I 've purchesed the S9 from Volume Cellular and received the item as promissed . in few days of usage , the device started to have problems with the controlls . within a week , the device was DEAD ! I contacted the seller , and advised of the situation , the seller was very helpful in providing assistance , and options including refund . Even I had encountered some problem when returning the device through UPS , the seller promply refunded my money upon receival . As I stated earlyer , Greater service , bad product from motorola ! ! Maybe just my bad luck on this device . Well buy again from the seller , just not another S9 head set .	-1
I was looking for a discrete bt earphone that worked OK . The important thing was portability and being discrete - not to look like a nerd on the streets.My objective was to listen to podcasts ... not too worried about sound quality.Well , the only thing that needed to work right was the blue-tooth transmission ... . and it does n't ! ! It works only inside my home and inside my car . When I 'm on the street it does n't work anymore ( I live in a big city with lots of radio interference ) . I have to bring my phone really close to the earphone in order for the BT to work without interruption.When I say it does n't work = the music plays for 2 seconds and pauses for 2 seconds , then plays a bit more and pauses a bit more ... it 's not just bad connection and noise . It just stops transmitting altogether.The funny thing is that for phone conversations , it does work anywhere . But when I 'm listening to music or a podcast , it does n't . I think that the stereo mode takes on more bandwidth and requires a better transmission rate ... . not possible with the interference ... whatever the reason - it 's worthless , unless you are in an interference-free zone.Ahhh.. the fitting . Not good . I have a big head , and even for me , the earphone has a loose fitting . I need to press it against my ears with my hands for it to be snug-fitting and easier to hear.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! I used an HTC Tytn II phone with windows mobile 6.0 to try this product .	-1
Awful product ! When I first received it , the Skip/Back function did not work , and I could not skip tracks from the headset as advertised . The volume was very low , even at maximum device and headseat volume levels . If the headset was exposed to even a little moisture , it either : randomly increased or decreased the volume ( with an insane `` beep '' every 1/2 second ) or stopped functioning altogether . This made the headphones useless for jogging/workouts or yard work - even a little bit of sweat screwed it up . The rubber ear pieces fell off after the third use . Finally , the range is horrible - unit cut out constantly while my cell phone was in its holster on my waist . I had to wear an arm holster so the unit would be in range . When I compare this 2 foot range to the 40+ foot range of another Bluetooth device , these headphones do n't measure up . I suppose it would be suitable for sleeping with your phone next to you on the bedstand ( and you do not sweat while you sleep ! ) ... Thank goodness it was only $ 50 on here instead of the $ 100 they were asking at retail stores .	-1
First , the goods : - stereo sound is very good ( for a wireless device ) ; - comfort is good , except there are no alternate size speaker cups in the bulk package . So if these are too large for you - you are out of luck , because it is almost impossible to get a replacement elsewhere . In terms of comfort , these would be perfect for a gym , except ... The bads : - the set looses a connection to the BT source at a mere turn of your head ! This flakiness is more than an inconvenience - for me it rendered this otherwise almost perfect device absolutely useless , so I end up returning it . I tried it with two sources : my Blackberry , and a laptop with a BT transmitter . The laptop transmitter is pretty powerful : with my other headphone ( also by Motorola , by the way , HT820 ) I can walk around the house , even go on a top floor without loosing the connection.But with this set , I lost the connection every time I turned my head or raised my arm . And what 's the deal with the replacement cups ? There is a link to an accessory site in the manual . The site is useless - nothing at all ! About the bulk packaging : it 's fine , except you do n't really know if you are getting a new item or a return ( I suspect the latter ) . Also , the retail package comes with an alternate size set of speaker cups , bulk package does n't have them .	-1
This was bought for use while jogging and it only works half the time . Very difficult to use consistently and definitely a regret buying since I 'd rather have paid more for something more dependable .	-1
I would NOT purchase this product off of the internet . I ordered one , recieved it , and it would n't even register that it was charging , so I did n't get to test it . I called Amazon , and they were great . The representative was kind and he quickly sent me a replacement item overnight . I opened that one up and it did charge . I had some trouble pairing it with my phone , but it did eventually do that . Then I tried to use it . When I put it in the `` on '' position , it turned off . When I put it in the `` off '' position , it turned on . I even took it to a brick and mortar store to make sure I was n't missing something . I did purchase one from that store , the H710 , the next model up , and I have to say that I do like it . It works great and is very comfortable on my ear . There also seems to be a bit of a quality discrepency between the two virtually identical items.The one I purchased at the store is a lot less `` plasticky '' than the one I ordered on-line . It just seems less-than-coincidental that i recieved two in a row that were malfunctioning significantly .	-1
Not much more to say . I too received the wrong charger , a Slim travel charger rated at 750mA with non-folding AC prongs , as others have pointed out.Amazon Customer Service immediately approved the return and it is on its way back.Pity about the faulty listing serviced by Amazon , Kudos on the ( as always ) great service.I 'll walk into a Verizon store and buy the real thing , I guess .	-1
I am still searching for a charger that will charge my old Motorola K1m KRZR . I still have a FMP5202A to use , but have been looking for a backup as well as one that allows me to plug in my choice of USB cables . So far anything other than a PC with the Moto USB drivers loaded or the FMP5202A gives me the & # 34 ; Unauthorized Charger & # 34 ; error message and fails to charge . I also tried a SPN5689A with no luck.Otherwise the charger will charge my Moto Atrix HD just fine , but for that purpose I have much smaller and faster chargers available . This charger will probably get thrown into the pile of useless electronics . Looks like I will be trying the local thrift stores and possibly pawn shops to see if they have any of the old chargers laying around .	-1
This charger does not charge rapidly , it 's just a normal charger . It is also a very bulky top charger , the bulkiest I 've seen in years , so it 's hard to fit other things in the outlet or power strip next to it . Do your self a favor and skip it	-1
i honestly didnt notice that my phone was charging faster ... .seems to me like its jus a regular phone charger ... says motorolla but i dont know , could be a fakey rip off ... its workin just like a regular charger , not impressed	-1
This product did not work out of the box . Plugged it into a phone and a tablet . No go . Avoid .	-1
I ordered this item as I already had 5 of the Motorola Mini-USB to Micro-USB that were working well from an earlier order with another company . When this one arrived I noticed that two of my phones ( a Droid Global 2 and an LG ) would not work with these ( I ordered 5 of these ) . Both of the adapters are molded plastic with the ID SKN6252A . The ones that work look just a little better built and are 97 mm versus the ones that do n't work which are 85 mm . Both have a hologram with the M trademark , but I suspect the ones that do not work are counterfeit . At least they were cheap .	-1
Being a Motorola I thought this would be really good , but it did n't last but about two weeks before the connection started going bad . I have to wiggle the micro usb end to keep the charging light on my phone . I have other mini usb cords/chargers and I do n't have a problem with them , so it 's not the port on my phone .	-1
Do n't waste your money on these because if they do work when u get them , they will quickly break and/or mess up your phone if u try to use it while it 's plugged in . It does n't work at all if u try to use it with your computer to transfer data like photos , etc . I 'm very disappointed b/c I purchased 4 of these since we went from cell phones having the micro usb charger to the mini usb chargers & it seemed like such a waste to throw our old cords away . I knew i was taking a risk after looking at some of the reviews , but i decided to chance it & struck out . My advice is not to even gamble on it working .	-1
From all the reviews , it seemed this little adapter was magic . However , I tried it with multiple mini cables and chargers and none of them would allow me to charge by MiFi from Novatel .	-1
I bought several of these and all of them stopped working within 2 weeks of receiving them . I would have returned them , but by the time I would have gone to the post office , paid for postage , and waited for them to come back , it was n't worth my time or money . Do n't buy .	-1
I bought two of these . The first one broke after a couple of months of infrequent use . I 'm using the second one now . Shoddy quality .	-1
The fit and materials were OK , but some of the holes were cut so poorly as to look like someone did them with a pocket knife , and there was a strip of silicone down one seam , like the mold was n't properly formed . The result was that the appearance of the product was embarrassingly bad . Save your money , and go for one that is better made ... perhaps made by RIM .	-1
I 'll start with the good . The case fits well . it feels good in your hand and still will slide in your pocket . The cutouts are all in the correct location . Now for the bad , which to me is most important because obviously , a case like this is not meant for protection of the phone , because it is thin , this case is meant for adding some color to your phone which is why I bought it , to match with outfits and stuff . Well this is an ugly dull banana color , its 'nothing ' like the picture , its not bold or bright at all . It looks faded and like it was left in the sun and all the color came out . very pale . I do not recommend this case to anyone . Maybe try another color because I have bought many cases and not had an issue like this before .	-1
I do not like the feel of rubber in my hands . I had to go to hard cover even though purple is my favorite color .	-1
One of the known problems with theBlackBerry Storm 9530 Phone , Black ( Verizon Wireless ) is that using Bluetooth voice-command dialing can lock up the phone , requiring one or more reboots ( remove the battery , wait 15 seconds , replace the battery , and wait 4-6 minutes ) . Many of my Storm problems were resolved by a Verizon support tech who had me use a command to `` wipe '' the device and start over again . I thought I 'd start clean and use this headset instead of my Motorola , which is recommended by the Storm manual ; the lock-up problem is better , but the phone still locks up occasionally.This headset fits more securely than my oldMotorola H700 Bluetooth Headset , but it takes considerably more pressure to press the control , and there is a longer delay between pressing the control and getting any response on the Storm . However , since it does seem to cause fewer lock-ups , I 'll continue to use this BlackBerry headset .	-1
I bought this product knowing for the reviews that I had to be gentle with it , the problem is that even though the red light lights up , it never worked . So cheep . Not worth returning	-1
This plug splitter worked fine for about one year . Last week I plugged in a air pump to the splitter , as I had done many times before and it caused the splitter to start melting and smoking . Had to quickly pull it out of car , almost too hot to handle.Made in China possibly ! ?	-1
Pros : You turn 1 outlet into 3 , and in theory , you get a USB charging port as wellFits perfectly into the empty DIN slot below my stereoSuper cheapCons : Incredibly bright power LED , really distracting while driving at nightAnytime you hit a bump , at least one plug pops outUSB charging port does n't work on minePlugs constantly pop outPower cord is incredibly thin , something silly like 20 or 22 gauge - do n't plug in anything that pulls a decent amount of power ( i.e . no inverters ) .Did I mention the plugs constantly pop out ? I deliver pizza on weekends , and the pizza sign plugs in to my lighter . I also keep my Zune and my phone charger plugged in . The pizza sign probably draws 1-2 amps or so by itself , with the Zune and phone pulling a little over an amp combined if the batteries are low . This is still enough to make the cord on it a little warm - I 'd be a bit more concerned if my lighter outlet had constant power , but on my car , it shuts off when you remove the key.Still , $ 3 , it 'll serve its purpose until I can get something a bit higher quality .	-1
I 've been a Wilson fan since their days of manufacturing HF yagis and love my Wilson Sleek . I decided to upgrade to this gain antenna for increasing signal strength . However , this antenna shows zero improvement over the little zero DB gain spike that comes with the Sleek . My guess is the RG174 is higher loss than the thicker cable that comes with the spike antenna and counteracts any gain from this antenna .	-1
The seller neglected to state that this antenna does n't work alone . I had no idea I needed to buy a separate receiver for it to work . Should be sold together .	-1
I purchased the blueant z9i headset based on the rave reviews submitted by other reviewers . Unfortunately , my personal experience with Blueant is nothing short of total disappointment.First off , a little history . Over the years , I have used the old Logitech bulky but trusty `` Logitech Mobile Freedom '' . Trust me , besides the bulkiness and fit , it has great battery life and very decent reception and sound quality . It has better wind resistant than most . My favorite is the Plantronics Voyager 510 . By far , itis the best sounding and most trustworthy bluetooth headset . I am still using it today . I do not like the look and the fit but it works fine . My only gripe is that it easily picked by ambient noise so wind noise and noisy environment kill the performance . In my quest of the ultimate bluetooth headset , I purchased the Plantronic Voyager 815 and it was such a disappointment.I also used bluetooth headsets from various brands such as Nokia and Motorola.When I read the rave review of Blueant noise cancellation technology , I jumped at the opportunity . Boy , am I disappointed when my receiving parties kept telling me there was a lot of noise ( regardless of adjusting the position ) in the background and my voice sounded tinny . The volume from the headset is also on the low side.Since then , I moved on to Jawbone II and then Jawbone prime .	-1
The ONLY one reason for me not to keep this unit was the fact that was n't working properly with my both mobile phones simultaneously.The noise cancellation factor was not a strong plus in this case .	-1
I have had this product now for over 9 months . As a matter of fact i own 2. the sound and clarity are fine even when walking around in noisy areas . The problem i have had with both is the ear piece . For one of them the ear piece post has broken off and with the second one the rubber gel on the earpiece has started separating from the post . Blue Ant wants to charge $ 20 for two replacement ear gels . That is ludicrous i can by a new blue tooth for $ 60.UPDATE : So now that I 've had to return my order . I realize that this was not the best choice . The Blue Ant sent was not in its retail package . Just the pieces in a padded envelope . That was fine initially since it was a refurb . Although , someone pack the wrong charger in the package . The return dept . stated I should sent the pieces back with UPC code and retail packaging ... .HUh ? I do n't think these guys know what they are doing.I need to find a better product .	-1
After using this headset for 2 months , I decided to finally leave a thorough review.Pros : Noise cancellation works very well . People ca n't even hear my noisy studded tires when I am driving.Headset is lightweight and feels great wearing it . ( I forget it 's in my ear it 's co comfortable . ) Volume can go very loud . It is much louder than most headsets.Cons : The metal/plastic earhook is very brittle and can break very easily . Mine snapped in half in the first two weeks.No dedicated on/off switch , so it turns on constantly if left in a pocket ( and then starts calling people when you bump the button ) .Earpiece screws on and off , but is very fragile . Mine broke after 2 months of usage.Horrible customer service when dealing with BlueAnt for warranty repair.Conclusion : For something that costs this much , I would expect it to be higher quality . While I really liked the call quality , it is n't worth having this headset if it wo n't last . If you are looking for decent noise cancellation , I 've found the Samsung WEP470 does just as good of a job , has a dedicated on/off button , and is less than half the price of this headset . Unless BlueAnt gets a more durable headset and better customer service , I do n't think it 's worth the premium pricing of their products .	-1
I would agree with reviewers that rate this speaker phone 1 or 2 stars . You can buy a much cheaper speaker phone that works just as well , which I would say is Mediocre . It works fine if there 's no road noise , but as soon as you hit the freeway your callers are all saying what , what ! and for some reason I also found the volume on my end going up and down to the point that I was saying what all the time too . I called my home phone several times and left test messages and what I herd when I got home and listened to the test was the audio had a distortion and a quivering quality to it like you would hear with a real cheep digital voice recorder . I also found the voice prompts got annoying after a while .	-1
People said that my voice was really muffled and the speaker isnt that great either ... stick to the earpiece for bluetooth	-1
I got 4 of these on sale , shortly after our state mandated no handheld phones in car . I chose the brand based on a solid year 's use of another Blueant bluetooth speaker I had bought for another person as a gift.Right away , one of the speakers was n't ever working properly . Weeks later , mine stopped working . The other 2 probably are n't getting used , as my wife does n't use her phone a lot and my mom probably let the battery die . I wo n't get feedback on those.They paired up right away and worked ( mostly ) off the line . But since 2 of the 4 I bought have either failed to stay paired or when paired simply have no quality connection I ca n't recommend this product and I hesitate to recommend the brand .	-1
Pros1 ) Compact2 ) Feature buttons ( receive call , end call ) clear and easily pressed.Cons1 ) Echo lends to poor sound reproduction2 ) Tinny sound .	-1
I just got this and really like it , but will not load my Iphone phone book and support on blue ant sucks . They want me to send it in for testing instead of a new one . Do n't buy it !	-1
We have had this bluetooth for two days and so far ca n't complain all that much . Yhe only complaint I have is that it will turn off in the midfle of your conversation with a fully charged battery . But my friend guy loves it so I 'm not going to complain cause I wo n't be using it ...	-1
You get what you pay for . I purchased this for a friend and now I lost that friend . They realized I 'm the type of person who buys cheap crap hoping it will perform . The thing never held a charge . When connected to a plug , sure , it worked nicely enough . But what 's the point of having a wired bluetooth ? ?	-1
that us only for Android tablets . I wish I had noticed that before I got it , sent it back obviously.I would think they would want ti make it for all tablets with capacitive screens ,	-1
I 've had this stylus for a month and while it worked well at first it does not now . The tip is dirty looking and it takes more pressure to get it to respond it also leaves many more smears on the screen then my fingers do . I 'm not sure how or if the tip can be cleaned . I would avoid this stylus unless you want one that is disposable .	-1
First , when the unit is operating normally , its lowest volume setting is too loud by a factor of 2 which is only good if you 're hard of hearing . If you 're not , this headset will probably damage your hearing until you no longer notice.Secondly , the unit spontaneously stops working . It becomes necessary to disconnect the battery not just once but twice . I tried replacing the battery so that 's not the problem . The result of accessing the battery so many times is that the cheap plastic cover will eventually loosen up and refuse to stay attached to the unit .	-1
1 . I 'm on my third pair of these headphones ; thankfully i only purchased them once , but Sennheiser has been a solid company and as sent me two brand new units.2 . Bottomline , these headphones are great sounding wireless / bluetooth headphones , they fit well ( at least my head ) and are easy to operate . However , as with all wireless headphones , they are overtly inferior to the traditional wired headphones in terms of sound quality and volume ( huge issue with me ) . Furthermore , compared to the `` BT '' wireless line in Sennheiser , this unit is overtly inferior in terms of sound and especially build quality . So getting to my main point ( sorry for taking so long ) , all in all a nice pair of wireless phones ( ie you should have a specific purpose for a wireless set over a traditional wired set ) . The problem with this specific line is that they 're poorly made . The on / off button is ... lame . Specifically , it 's difficult to tell if you 're pressing down on the button properly . Ok , so what one may say and I agree . Clarifying statement in terms of the poorly made : I have send back two units because one unit would not turn off ( I tried every trick in the book , but the button was stuck or something else was going on ) The other unit would n't turn on consistently . There would be days where it would work properly and then other days when the darn thing would n't powerup ( yes , the headphones were fully fully charged ) .3 . Thus , unless you specifically require this type / shape of headphones ( which I do ) , then I would strongly recommend going with the higher priced but definitely much better Sennheiser wireless phones ( ex : the BT line , which are truely 5 star products ) .4 . On a side note : Kudos to Sennheiser for being a 5 star company ; no questions asked , no hassles , they 're a company that stands behind their products and puts out excellent stuff ... most of the time .	-1
This second unit has a crooked band around the neck and it does not fit the ear well . I did not use it and it is too late to return a defective product that came to me like that .	-1
These mini battery chargers do work , but they are extremely slow . Most modern smartphone external battery chargers use 800 to 1000mA of electricity . These mini chargers only use 200mA . Simple math tells you that they will need 4 or 5 times as much time to charge your battery . If you have all night , maybe that is n't a big deal . Do n't use this if you 're in a hurry .	-1
I only rated this charger two stars because it takes so long for this second battery to charge . I have two external chargers that I plugged my spare batteries into and my captivate battery charged much faster then my infuse battery ( they both were completely new & needing a full charge ) . So it works however its taking 7hrs or more to fully charge my spare batteries . Ok its been only 4 days now and this charger does not work . It blinks like its charging but when the extra battery is place in the phone it has not charged at all . This is disappointing dropping to 1 star no star if it was possible !	-1
I am iPhone 3G user . I love the iPhone . I had a cheap Motorola H375 BT earpiece that worked just fine except it was n't very comfortable in my ear and fell out easily . It sounded good though.I used to own a Blue Ant Speakerphone . It was great ! It had a great battery life and worked perfectly right up to the day it `` buzzed '' and just died . I got a lot of usage from it and I was left with a favorable opinion of the company even though it just went kaboom one day.I am a self professed gadget freak . Ok , there I said it.When I saw the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset and read about it 's features I just knew it was for me . Initially it was to expensive but when I saw it on Amazon for $ 79 I figured I could n't go wrong.ROFL ! Okay , I always try and give new gadgets a fair trial before recommending it to my friends or clients or giving up on it . I have now been using the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset exclusively since December 2009.It is simply the most frustrating Bluetooth earpiece I have ever used ! After 3 weeks I turned off the voice prompts & speech recognition . It announces the CallerID for incoming calls but it 's seems to take forever to finish what it wants to say BEFORE you can answer the phone.If the earbud is n't perfectly aligned with you ear you will just tick off people if you call or answer them as they ca n't hear anything you are saying . This is especially prevalent in the car . ( 2003 Ford Expedition EB , a somewhat quite car ) It really has trouble coordinating things with the iPhone 3G . Calling out , no problem , It uses the earpiece just fine . Go to answer a call ... Not so much , it selects the iPhone and you manually have to select the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset on the iPhone menu . Okay before I get a bunch of replies , YES I DID TRY `` THIS AND THAT '' . It just did n't work properly consistent if at all on the inbound calls.Okay , with all of this , I still continued to try the BlueAnt V1 Bluetooth Headset but I have now given up on it.Perhaps I will just put it on my bookshelf and marvel at the technology that allows all this functionality in such a small form factor . I guess I 'd be more amazed if it actually worked.Pros : Comfortable and stays put on my ear.Volume level is decentGooG-411 built in and is hard coded into the speech recognitionCons : It sucks.Poor audio fidelityNot iPhone friendlyIt sucks.Battery life not to good.Really Bright blinking while on . ( This can be deactivated but likes to come back on ) It sucks.In case I was n't clear , I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.I hope you find this review useful as I too read these reviews myself when I am about to purchase products , like the new Bluetooth headset I am going to buy now . Let the research begin ! ~e	-1
The idea of this Bluetooth headset is a good one however I had some problems with the voice commands capability . On more than one occasion in a months time , it stopped recognizing any voice commends ( like 'dial voicemail ' 'call back ' etc ) . I had to power it off and back on a couple of times to get it to work again.I also thought the caller id announce would be nice , but in practice , it only works if you wear the headset all the time . If you are not wearing it and miss the caller id announce , but put it in your ear as the phone is ringing and press the button to answer the call , it only works about half of the time . I actually missed several calls and had to call people back due to this . Also , I find that I like to just put the headset on when I need to make or receive a call and then take it off . For this , I feel that the Plantronics 925 is a better choice since it 's a bit easier to put in my ear and take off and it comes with a nice charging case for storage . With the BlueAnt , I always had trouble figuring out where to put it when not in use.Also , on the BlueAnt , callers said I sounded more muffled than on the Plantronics although they could hear less background noise . In practice , noise cancellation is n't really a big deal because I find that I would rather make a call in a semi-quiet environment anyway . If I 'm in my car , I just roll the windows up , no big deal.I ended up returning this headset mainly due to the reliability issue . The fact that my voice did n't sound as good as other Bluetooth headsets was also a deal breaker for me . I 'd rather sound better and not have as good noise cancellation than have good noise cancellation but sound crappy .	-1
I bought this product because I was getting a new phone and tend to drop my phones a lot . I wanted the most protective cover I could buy . After doing lots of on-line research , I purchased the body glove product.It provided awesome protection and was very easy to take on and off the phone , but it made my phone bulky and uncomfortable to talk on . I almost returned the phone and then found the problem solved when I took off the cover . I have fairly small hands , so that could be part of the problem .	-1
Hard to use and set up . Wo n't stay on the ear . And hurt my ear to wear it.Other than that . It was load enough to hear the other person . And had a noise canceling button . Just did n't work well for me . Maybe for others it would work better . Gave it away .	-1
I just was n't happy with the fit for my ear . The connection with my phone was n't as clear as one of my previous motorola 's . Gave it away to someone that seemed to like it fine .	-1
I 've had the unit for three days . The product suffers from these glaring problems:1 . It is painful to wear . The earpiece cover is made of HARD rubber . Not foam . Not soft rubber . I am using the smallest of the three covers and my ear is bruised . I could wear the Plantronics Bluetooth for hours ; this one is agony after a few minutes.2 . The on/off button is located underneath the flexible skin of the unit . It is on a hair-trigger . I have disconnected numerous calls trying to adjust the Jawbone 's position or the volume because touching the outer skin of the unit in any way hangs up the call.3 . Sound quality is HORRIBLE . To be fair the marketing hook for this unit is the microphone technology . They should have saved some research money for the speaker . The sound is tinny and garbled.Keep looking : this unit is not the answer .	-1
The Jawbone may perform admirably as far as technology . I generally do n't care about that so much , not having a sports car , and trying to avoid loud environments when I 'm on a conference call.My issues are that the unit simply does n't work well . I 've tried all the different tips , including the available free additional tips and none of them stay in my ear . You can jam the thing in there but it slowly works its way out over the course of a couple of minutes . And since the only button is the external body of the unit , if you try to press it back in you end up hanging up the call . Great idea not to have a button or anything . Similarly if you try and turn the thing off or on , you hold down the `` button '' and you 'll find your thumb covers up the little red/green light that tells you whether its on or not . Stupid .	-1
Do n't Buy it ! ! The ear hooks seemed to break after a month of wearing ... but wait it came w/ 3 or 4 additional ... .but wait there are more to buy but wait why would you want to but more when the thing would shut off w/out waring or be unable to saty connected to your phone ! ! ! ! Wow god thing amazon had it for a reasonable price and that I did not get hosed on the price at the retail store ! ! ! buy the Plantronics M50 - Bluetooth Headset ! ! look for it amazon has it ! ! ! ! L.S.ThomasWest chester , Pa .	-1
I 've had this headset for less than a year and it 's already busted . The ear loop snapped off while it was in the pocket of my suit . On top of that , the battery life on the headset has greatly diminished in it 's capacity . I can only hold a 1 hour conversation before I need to charge it again . It seems like the headset is in the charger more than it is in my ear.Performance wide , it does not seem to perform as advertised . It does not do a very good job at removing the background noise.Friends that have this headset also have complained about its feel and performance . I would not recommend this headset to anyone .	-1
I am disappointed with this unit . First of all the buttons are placed in such a way that you are constantly hanging up on people when you are adjusting the headset in your ear.Audio is terrible in regular mode ( hearing other people ) . It works great in Noise Assassin mode but that mode drains battery power quickly and has to be turned on every time you use it.Then there is the problem with getting the unit close to your cheek so that the noise cancellation can work correctly . It is a real pain . If your beard is slightly growing in , forget it . It will not work.The size of the unit was good . The fit in my ear was not that great and hurt my ear after a while . They should have included Jabra ear gels.While this unit has good technology behind it , the design needs work .	-1
Aliph Jawbone II is a farce . I tested it by calling several people and nobody can hear me well . They all said I sounded very far away , even though the volume was at it 's maximum . The fit is not comfortable at all . I tried every single earbud and earloop . If the VAS button ca n't make contact with your face , the unit is useless . As you have to press it against your face ( face too skinny ? ) , what is the point of wearing a headset if you need to use one hand to operate it and the other hand on the steering wheel ? This is not safe IMHO .	-1
I really wanted to like this headset . Before I purchased it , I thought it was small , unobtrusive , no blinky-blinky lights , very subtle and professional . And all of the blogs yammering about `` military-grade Noise Assasin '' technology made me think I could n't go wrong.Wrong.After purchasing it , I could n't get it to stay in my ear , and I tried many ( I got bored after about a dozen ) iterations of over ear and in-ear adjustments . But I was willing to tolerate it falling out of my ear all the time , if it just served its primary function.But it didn't.People kept saying they could n't hear me , or the background noise was intolerable ( so much for noise assassin ) . Also , whenever I tried pressing the Jawbone further into my ear so I could hear better , I pushed the disconnect button and ended my call.Ooops.And I paid the early adopter price at the AT & T ; store ; nearly $ 150 with shipping.My bad.Do n't repeat my error . This is not a good product .	-1
i bought the aliph jawbone II bluetooth headset with noiseasssassin in black and i hated it it did not work like it suppose to .	-1
The Jawbone II bluetooth headset is not really made very well and is a lot worse than people seem to give it credit for . Parts fall off after a short time and it is very cheaply made.Further , once you set it up , you can only use it on one ear . Other headsets ( like Plantronics ones for example ) allow you to swivel the earloop to switch ears if you get tired of using it on one ear . The Jawbone does n't do this . In order to switch ears , you have to remove the earloop and reinstall it.While the Jawbone 's noise cancellation does seem good that 's about all it has going for it because your voice still sounds muffled , soft and digital-like.But my main complaint is with the Aliph Jawbone company customer service itself-they are absolutely horrible . They advertise on their website that the Jawbone has a 1 year manufacture warranty to the end consumer . But , my Jawbone broke and when I contacted them about getting warranty service on it , they rudely informed me that they only provide warranties on units bought directly from their own website . If I bought from some other retailer , it has ZERO warranty ! I 'm not sure whether or not this is even legal , but do believe it reflects very poorly on the company that they do n't even stand behind their own products.I would never recommend buying this headset or any other made by Aliph.A much better choice would be theBlueAnt Z9i Bluetooth Headset ( Black ) because : -It does n't require the unit to be touching your jaw bone or cheek at all-It 's a lot easier to put on and take off-It 's more comfortable and does n't fall off as easily-It ' has two selectable levels of noise cancellation-It 's firmware update-able-It has wind noise suppression-It 's cheaper yet audio quality both to callers and to you are about the same . Noise cancellation is about equal-It has a full 2 year warranty	-1
This paired ok but both talk modes people had trouble hearing me and the quality of the conversation was very poor . this is not a good head set !	-1
I purchased this product because I work in a noisy environment , and thought this would do the trick . It worked fine as far as noise reduction , but fails in the design.I had problems getting used to the fact that I did n't need to raise my voice to be heard on the phone . I 'm having to shout at someone 5 feet away , and then speak normally when on the phone . Hard to get used to , but I was working on it ! This device though , is extremely painful to wear for any length of time . The part behind the earpiece , that rides on the cartilage of my ear has some very nice sharp , pointy corners that get painful after a couple of minutes . I tried all combinations of earpiece & hangar without success . I would have tried the Jabra ear gels that others have recommended except for one other issue.I use a headset as an occasional device , but this seems to be designed to be worn at all times . I want a device that will turn on when I want it on , not on its own . The power button is extremely easy to depress and turn on . I carry this in a pouch on my belt , and the pressure of the pouch was turning it on when it was in it . I try to answer an incoming call , and find it has gone to the device instead of the phone.In summary if it fits good , and you 're going to wear it all the time , this is a great device , especially in a noisy environment .	-1
I own 2 of the first generation - they are just wonderful . This new JB is very comfortable . The clarity is lacking and the noise reduction does not seen as good . Callers at the other end are always complaining of the poor quality . I have had to do a total reset several times due to a total deterioration in sound .	-1
This case is well made and feels good at first but then it stretched out badly and I do n't use it anymore .	-1
After 9 months of using the JawboneII , I have to give it a middling score overall . The earbuds that came with it were completely worthless , and I have now broken the last earloop . So I 'm back to using my Motorola H710 . I had forgotten what a good fit it was ! No more worrying that when I take it off or put it on , I 'll bend the earloop too far and break it . The only thing the Jawbone has in it 's favor is the noise-cancelling . Besides inadvertantly ending calls when the thing threatens to drop off my ear , I would also get a strange noise sometimes when attempting to answer a call ( kind of like the noise you hear when tightening guitar strings ) .Too bad they did such a terrible job in the fitting department . I even purcased the eargels on Amazon after breaking the first loop or two , trying to get it to fit better .	-1
I waited for this product ( GOLD version ) and bought it online as soon as it was available . Not smart . The fit is horrible : it falls out constantly ! In addition , there is no case so it will turn on when it is touched by other items in my purse . Also , the battery life is NANO seconds . This was a bad purchase decision and it cost too much $ $ $ , whhich makes o sense given the poor fit . I bought it for the color and style instead of the quality . My dad was right : the best lessons are the ones we pay for ... .	-1
The holder itself is fine , but beware that the text and pictures used with the product are not accurate . The text describes and the pictures show items not actually included in the package . Specifically , the AMPS mounting plate -square plastic piece with four holes in the corners- is NOT in the box . That part is specifically why I wanted this holder and now I will have to order it separately even though is is supposed to be included.The holder itself seems fine . I 've used Bracketron before and this is more or less a typical Bracketron holder.Unfortunately , I need that AMPS plate . If your car is outfitted for AMPS like mine , just be prepared to spend more money and time acquiring that one little part that should be included per the item description .	-1
Horrible device - I had purchased 3 of these from various sources - one from Amazon - guess what 2 of the three have broken - one at the joint behind the holder - and one of the devices jaws came open while driving dropping my expensive device.Just a poor buying and using experience .	-1
I 'm only being honest people ... complete utter junk ! With all the other things out there I should have never purchased this . I was in a rush so I jumped to a bad item . All phone are different so I will give you this tip : get something that you can mount to your dashboard with double side white foam tape . However , do n't install it in the middle of the dash . If possible fix it to the drivers left side corner of the dash . Now it is out of the line of sight for distractions.As for this thing ... it shakes , it rattles , it makes all kinds of noise and the weight of a smart phone was just to much for it .	-1
i thought for $ 8 these were a good deal , but they are uber-cheap ! the spring-loaded vent clips only attach on the top of the unit , and the thicker vents on my jeep cause them to pop off occasionally . also , the bottom of the mount does n't attach at all , so every time you hit a bump in the car , the phone and mount flop around ... poor design , if you need a vent mount look elsewhere !	-1
The design is okay , but the whole thing is made from really cheap plastic.The ball joint mechanism is really hard to move and adjust.The ball joint has a plastic cylindrical protusion that attaches to the holder . That part broke , it is weak and thin . If they were gon na make the most important joint thin , then they should 've made it out of metal , not cheap plastic .	-1
I guess its a crap shoot when you buy cheap , but since a Lot of the reviews were positive I decided to give it a try . Unfortunately the & # 34 ; Spring loaded locking mechanism & # 34 ; did not work on this one , making it effectively useless	-1
Unless you hit the sweet spot in installation the holder fits awkwardly and does n't feel sturdy . I would recommend going with an air vent mount or a CD slot mount .	-1
well the golden rule always works - you get what you paid for . Would n't retract after 3-4 times . too think to fit your iPhone if it have protective case . Otherwise works great : ) Will make great garage sell item	-1
I purchased this case from BBuy and I have had it for almost a year . The cheap , thin leather has peeled all the way off and now I just have a sharp and jagged plastic case . I do not recommend this case as it will also start to loosen over time . I use the DLO case as it 's reliable.I also have a high quality screen protector , which IMHO , is the most important protection you can put on an iphone . Whatever case you end up getting , get a high quality screen protector ... As far as this case goes , I 'm looking to replace it with something very lean so I can still put the phone in the DLO ... as you can see , I like a few layers of protection for my beloved iphone !	-1
The case itself is fantastic , as many reviewers have said . Fantastic grip , button access is excellent , and I 'm way more confident taking the phone to the store and the gym with this case on . I really needed a case+belt clip solution , though , and this does n't seem to cut it . The belt clip is really flimsy . It is quite difficult to put on and off the belt , and I 'm pretty sure the clip will break very soon . The holster itself is also flimsy , and if you wear it with your shirt on the outside ( not tucked into pants ) , there is a big piece of plastic that digs into your skin from the back of the clip . I may keep this for now just for the case , but will have to keep looking for a viable case+clip solution .	-1
I like the case , but it has a funny smell that gives me a headache . I had to send it back .	-1
I used this on a long 20+ hour flight ( multiple connecting flights ) and it recharged my phone fine on the first flight . But then it could only recharge it partially on my second ( connecting ) flight . I recharged it overnight in the hotel at my first destination before going on a long bus ride , and it would n't fully charge my phone while enroute to my second destination . That 's been my experience with this thing since then.The 5200 mAh is very overrated . Maybe like 3000 mAh when new , and much less after it 's been used a couple of times.This is my experience from 2011 . It 's been stored in a drawer for over year , and I found it while cleaning up and finally decided to review it.Junk , stay away .	-1
Mine looked as good as new and seemed to be complete , but the seals on the package had been broken when I received it . It was pretty obviously something that had been returned but that 's not a big deal to me ( if it had been underwear or something I might have been concerned ) . Anyway , it arrived nearly fully charged ( four out of five lights ) when I plugged it into a USB port on my laptop . So I plugged the output from the Satechi into my Nook Color and lo and behold , the Nook proprietary cable lit up and it started charging away . I turned on a video and let it play while the Satechi charged it and the Nook charge was increasing consistently the whole time.Then I disconnect the Satechi from my laptop so that it was no longer being powered . Oops . In less than five seconds the Nook cable 's charging light turned off . I pressed the status button on the Satechi ( which is supposed to briefly light the indicators so you can see how much juice you have left ) and nothing ... no lights at all . The Nook started discharging normally.I plugged the Satechi back into my laptop and all the status lights lit back up , as well as the Nook cable 's charging light . Bottom line : the Satechi was obviously charged , but would n't send a charge to the Nook unless the Satechi itself was being powered . Kind of defeats the purpose . If I had n't gotten what appeared to be used goods I would have returned it for another - it sounds like a great thing - but decided against bothering with that and just returned it .	-1
*** IMPORTANT : This battery only properly charges from a laptop USB port . DO NOT attempt to use with a car charger , wall charger , etc . unless you confirm that it puts out ONLY 500 mA , and no more . See [ UPDATE ] section below , for more details . *** [ Capacity summary : was able to ( carefully ! ) charge my Droid X **which has an extended internal battery with 20 % more capacity** 1.3 times . If product worked as advertised , I should have been able to charge at least 2.3 times , assuming my Li-ion phone battery is at the poor end of the charging-efficiency spectrum . Would expect at least 2.7 charges for Droid X with regular ( non-extended ) internal battery . ] Overall design is very nice ; it looks very nice , shape is good , very attractive . But ... several problems.First , this battery was supposed to be in 'new ' condition , but was very clearly ( and heavily ) pre-used ; the box had stains , sticky stuff , and extra circular stickers on it ( from where the previous 'owner ' broke the seal ) .Second , it did n't work . My phone ( Droid X with genuine Motorola extended battery BH6X , which holds 1800 mAh instead of the usual 1500 ) could only charge from it a total of about 1.3 times , before the external battery was totally drained . I was surprised , so I repeated the test , and got the same results . I was super careful : I let the external battery charge for 36 hours ; I waited til my phone was down to 30 % ; then I charged it up to 100 % ( cell was on ; gps/wireless off ; all tasks killed ; screen off/no activity ) . I then disconnected the external battery right away , when the phone reached 100 % .I then repeated the process ; I plugged the phone into the external battery at 30 % . About two hours later , it was at 70 % , but the external battery was 100 % drained.Very disappointing performance . It was only able to transfer 45 % of its alleged energy to the Droid X ( 1800 x 1.3 = 2340 mAh , out of 5200 ) , but Wikipedia says that Li ion should be able to charge at 80-90 % efficiency -- so something is clearly wrong here.I would stay away ; I was worried when I bought it , noticing that many recent reviews ( as of April 2011 ) had complained of the same . I think they 're selling a bunch of their returned units . This really irks me , as I 'm extremely busy , and really do n't have time for this kind of stuff ; I want to just buy a product that works and lasts , and I 'm happy to pay whatever it takes . [ UPDATE ] Satechi contacted me . They claim that smart phone chargers provide too many amps , and that this fries the external battery . They recommend *only* charging from a laptop ( where the USB is limited to 0.5A ) , whereas I used ( in my two tests ) chargers with 850 and 1000 amps.However , this is no excuse ; this is a design defect . You should be able to charge from any source , as long as it has at least 500 mA . Every other electronics device on the planet has circuitry to limit the amperage it takes in to what it needs , and gracefully rejects excess current . They tried very hard over the phone to convince me that this was not a design defect ; I found this very disingenuous . Review remains at 1 star ... sorry , Satechi . [ /END UPDATE ]	-1
Connects quick to my phone , but calls are dropped . Makes a weird high pitch squeel while it charges . The charger is not mini usb which means you have to use the proprietary one ( negative imo ) . I got it for $ -3 after a rebate . I 'm happy getting paid $ 3 to buy this headset . Good shipping.Update : I did n't get the rebate so $ 23 for a pretty bad bluetooth . It is the only one I have that works currently . Callers complain about lots of noise on my end . The controls are pretty bad and I can not use for voice commands with HTC Incredible .	-1
I also have the Samsung WEP 200 which works well the microphone does n't pick up too much noise and the speaker gets plenty loud . The WEP 301 ca n't be used in some cars at highway speeds because it picks up too much noise . It is almost as if there is no frequency filter.There are good things about it . The wire for your ear can be adjusted to fit . The headset comes with several different ear attachments . There are some `` fun skins '' you can add to it.I got this headset assuming it would be at least as good as the WEP 200 . It is n't .	-1
This is junk . I have never had one sound so bad . It does n't even hold a charge for very long	-1
When I ordered this Zagg Screen Guard , I figured it was really good becuase there'svideos and people bragging about it.Well I was really dissapointed . Why ? Because it 's nothing but a piece of rubber.It does n't look normal on the phone . My fingers didn'tglide accross the screen . And it left to much of aresidue and it was all streaked.Look , just stick with the regular hard screen protectors.There way more dependable and less expensive and comes with more than 1 .	-1
Instead of giving you guys a long review of this product , I am going to give you a summary of this product . BTW , I am not a rookie in term of installing screen protectors , I used to work in a cell phone company , and have installed countless screen protectors for customers.Pro : NONECon : Will distorte your screen image , very unclear ( made of cheap vinyl ) super Sticky , It 's almost impossible to remove it without pulling your screen off your phone literelly . Leaves residues on your phone after you remove it , and it 's a nightmare to remove the residues on your screen , even with the trick of using a piece of tape to remove the residues . I had to exchange my phone because after removing this screen protector my touch sensore started acting up on me . I am asking for a refund , and maybe even damage to my phone.If you care about your expensive phone , please , please DO NOT BUY this product , it will give you more nightmares than you can handle !	-1
iBought Invisible shield for the back of my iPhone 3G . I studied all of the installation videos and instructions . Invisible Shield is impossible to apply properly . It sticks to itself when peeling it off the backing . The edges do not apply properly around the corners of iPhone 3G . The part of the film that does apply to the back of iPhone looks nasty . At least Zagg accepted my return and credited the charge on the money-back guarantee .	-1
I bought this product because it seemed like an excellent alternative to a case . The product was difficult to install and did not cover the corners of my phone . I ended up throwing it out , do not waste your money because it is more difficult than it is worth you will be frustrated and your phone will have bubbles all over it .	-1
The case looks good but it functionally left a lot to be desired . I found that it rode high on my waist and dug into me when I sat down . When I accidentally turned the case on its side ( I bought the clip and attachment that allows the case to rotate ) my iPhone 4 fell out and hit my asphalt driveway . Luckily , there was no damage . There is nothing on top of the case to hold the phone in . Once I put a case back on the iPhone the phone fit snugly in the holster , but I still did n't feel comfortable knowing that there was no clip or flap on top of the holster to hold the phone in place . So back it goes and I wound up with the Seidio Innocase Holster which works quite well . The Seidio with the Incipio NGP case make for a great combination .	-1
I acquired this headset whenSOCOM : Confrontationwas first released and thought I was getting a deal by getting the game AND the headset for about $ 60 . I could n't have been more wrong.As headsets go , I have worn a LOT of them . I 've owned old-fashioned wired headsets , pre-bluetooth wireless that communicated with a little receiver you clipped to your belt and plugged into your phone , and of course ... plenty of bluetooth sets.Let me start by saying that you do NOT need this headset for a PlayStation3 . In theory , ANY bluetooth headset will work with a PS3 . ( Granted some wo n't because bluetooth is inherently buggy technology . ) Likewise , this headset will work with almost any bluetooth phone . However , my personal preference is to have separate headsets because I do n't like pairing and unpairing all the time.Having said that , let 's talk about this headset . It is about as basic as basic gets . If all you need is basic , more power to you , but you 'll find similar quality for less money with other sets . Try theJabra BT4010 , which as of this writing sells for half the price of the Sony . Heck , you can even find $ 10 bluetooth headsets if you really want to go cheap ! Apart from poor value , the Sony set is an awkward fit . It has only a thin rubber ring around a little plastic `` barrel '' that is supposed to stay fastened in your ear . Most other sets either have a `` form-fitted '' rubber piece or simply stay out of your ear altogether . This design gets uncomfortable quickly because A ) the part that goes in your ear may not be the right size for your ear and B ) the over-the-ear loop is made of cheap plastic as opposed to being rubber or having a rubber coating like many other sets.The battery life is decent , but nothing to write home about . And the charging stand ? It 's cheap , very lightweight plastic that falls over very easily . If the USB cable is a little bit stiff , the natural tendency for it to curl may very well topple the stand.As for sound quality ... yeah , basic again . Sure , it works , but once again it is very basic . I felt like it did n't have a very good range of volume . Many times I had it cranked to the max and still could barely hear.Since games are usually $ 60 and this headset came bundled inside a $ 60 game , I tried hard to find a reason to keep it , after all was n't it `` free '' ? In the end , I could find no redeeming qualities and returned it rather than allowing it to take up space in a drawer somewhere.If you 'd like some good places to start your search for another headset , here are a few : Personally , I just ca n't get over theJabra FreeSpeak BT250V . It 's so comfortable I do n't even notice it 's there and it also has a vibrating/call notification feature , which is absolutely great for leaving your phone on the charger and keeping the headset with you at home or office . As of this writing , the Sony is ~ $ 45 and the Jabra is ~ $ 60 . You may find the Jabra cheaper but even at $ 60 it 's DEFINITELY a better value than the Sony ! If you 're looking for a really great sounding bluetooth set ( i.e . for listening to music ) , I 've been really happy with theMotorola HT820 . It has two speakers and wraps around the back of your head/neck . Fair warning , though- the Motorola sounds awesome but the speakers are huge and wearing this set makes you look like a total dork.There are hundreds , maybe even thousands of bluetooth headsets out there so no matter which one you finally choose , please just do n't make it this Sony piece of junk . Your dollars will go farther on something with the same quality/lower price , or same price/higher quality .	-1
Have had this for a couple years now ( not purchased on amazon ) and it works great but it hurts my ears where it hangs after using it for 30mins and is loose too.. bad ergonomics .	-1
Unnecessary equipment for Ipod touch 2g , unless your fingers are gigantic . Then maybe you might need this . I gave mine away .	-1
This `` Stylus Pen '' is not going to work out well for use on my iTouch . The problem is that the rubber tip is not good for sliding on the touch screen , so it sticks and skips on the surface . It also feels like pressing hard enough to make the sliding work ( most of the time ) is going to brake the iTouch and , while I 'm not sure how much pressure that would require , I 'm not going to chance it . It does work just fine for selection and pressing icons\buttons , but that 's about it.The `` Pen '' itself is a fairly light aluminum body with a handy pocket clip , no complaints there.My search for a good stylus continues - Not Recommended ! CFH	-1
a tubular aluminum , 4 & # 34 ; long stylus with a soft cushion for a tip . Not really worth buying . If you need a stylus do better research , save your money & buy something better .	-1
I bought a whole collection of various styluses for my iPod Touch . I 've used Handspring and Palm PDAs for about 10 years ( Visor , m515 , Zire 71 , Tungsten TX ) and just do n't like using my chubby fingers for input on the Touch . These rubber-tipped styluses and their foam-tipped cousins do n't do the job . The iPhone/Touch screen surface is not designed to work with a stylus . Finding a place to keep the stylus is also a problem . With a PDA , there is a slot for it . For my iPod Touch , there is no slot , so the stylus is in my pocket , not with the Touch . I tried using these styluses for a few days , then gave it up and went back to my pudgy fingers . I could write five times faster using Graffiti , but my Palm died and alas , Palm no longer sells anything but phones .	-1
If you 're looking for something to make using your touch screen easier to use ... .save your money . This product does not work well at all . You have to push hard on the screen ( which ca n't be good for the screen ) and is more of a pain than it 's worth .	-1
This thing wo n't slide on the screen at all . It 's as though it were actually designed to grip the screen like a race car tire . Absolutely worthless for handwriting and almost impossible to use for drawing . All you can do is tap with it.It 's not even worth $ 1 . Just spend $ 10 on a real stylus that actually slides on the screen with minimal friction .	-1
This pen does n't work very well at all . I have to tap the iphone screen several times so it will register the contact . The pen also needs to be completely flat on the iphone screen in order to work at all . The only good part was the price . You get what you pay for ...	-1
I bought this item for my iPhone and when it arrived suprise , it does not work with the iPhone . It is also made of low quatity . Great price if it worked .	-1
This is a nicely manufactured product , looks good , fine build quality . It just does n't work well.As a general use tool for operating the iPhone 4 , this is less useful than my fingertips . The spongy tip is too sticky , and does n't glide over the screen surface , and it must be pushed on fairly firmly to register well with the screen sensor -- making it even stickier . It is fair-to-middling decent for tapping -- there 's no sliding involved , and substantial pressure . `` flicking '' and other dragging gestures just simply do n't work well with this stylus.So unless you find typing and button pushing highly problematic on the iPhone 4 , and do n't mind carrying around a tool exclusively for those specific tasks , I suggest skipping this . I have tried very hard to like my $ 9 rubber-tipped sticklet , but ... I don't.I find that a fingernail works better , and does n't take up pocket space.I recommend that you grow one fingernail slightly long . Index finger works well . It is good for precise tapping and yet will also flick and drag smoothly and effectively.Seriously , it works better than this stylus .	-1
I am so disappointed this phone did not work out . I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71 , except for one essential . Due to a hearing problem , I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100 % of the time . I tried this one in my pocket , and in a good quality waist/belt case , and could never feel it even though I 'd just called it myself from our land line , and knew full well that it was ringing . Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good ? Because I ca n't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option . Even if I had good hearing in both ears , there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate ( school , church , work meetings , etc. ) . Without it , I consider there to be no reason to own it . No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve , and really like it , but I 'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one `` be aware '' item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option . I do n't know why , since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe . But I was not deterred by that , and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone ( I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it , and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line : except for the vibrator being very weak , this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating , and very likely 5 stars .	-1
I just got this last night and was really excited at first from reading all the great reviews from others . However , I realized that it 's not as what 's hyped up to be . The memory did n't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features does n't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes . Furthermore , I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again ! The GPS does n't work either since I have the old AT & T ; service and I do n't have the data plan . I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it does n't require internet service but satellite only . The short-cut email feature does n't work either ! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again . So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way , so what 's the short-cut feature for if it does n't work ? Also , I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one ? ? ! ! The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push . All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which . I guess I 'm used to having iPhone 's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment . I would n't be complaining too much if this E71 had n't been over $ 300 dollars . If it were only around $ 200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star . For $ 300 you can do much better . In fact , iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it . I just did n't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try . Before I close , I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it . I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I ca n't use email , map and GPS features from this phone . So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $ 300.Edit : Someone responded to my review by saying that since I did n't have a data plan I could n't download maps and emails . That 's true but I was logged on with Wi-Fi and it still did n't work , whereas with iPhone I did n't have any of those issues .	-1
I bought this Nokia E71 for Straight Talk service . I thought this was the best phone in the world , until it started givi g me problems 1 1/2 weeks later . I took it back , got another one , and within 3 weeks it gave me the same problems . By then I could only return itto the phone company . And boy did I return it about 6 times . Getting new phone back each time . The last time 1 month ago , they sent me a refurb phone , well it was about 3 weeks ago . Now my phone wont turn on , it couldnt find memory card , it gets hot , it freezes all the time , when you reset it , you lose the main app '' ovi store '' now i have to send itback again . Im very upset with Nokia.This is the worse Nokia phone I ever had . Its ashame too , becausethis phone had it all . If only it could just work . I looked on Nokia forum and everybody s complaining about the same issues . Everybody , and its not only with this model , its with other similar models too . Nokia please fix it . Bacause right now your at the bottom . Im really about to find another service provider due to this . Anybody know a phone company with unlimited everything for a low price who makes good phones , let me know .	-1
I bought this phone from Amazon.com . This is an AT & T phone with Logo on the phone . It is not a truly unlocked phone . The SIM restriction has been removed . You will be able to make and receive phone calls with most sim cards . You will not be able to send or receive txt , mms , email , use data , no gps , no internet , wifi becomes unusable . Had to return this item . You can buy a featureless , sim unrestricted phone for $ 15- $ 20 in Amazon.com or online auction sites . Very disappointed .	-1
They can be used to scroll up and down lists , but when you try to type with these stylus ' , they wo n't work .	-1
It 's cheap and functional . What do you expect for a penny per item ? Got one each for me and my wife , but we do n't use them anymore . With the iphone , you get used to using your fingers pretty quickly . For other devices this might be OK , otherwise do n't bother if it 's for the iphone .	-1
This product is n't worth the money . You have to press pretty hard to get it to pick up , and when you do the crappy tip compresses and scrapes the also crappy metal of the case into the screen .	-1
Do n't waste your money . First you ca n't keep track of it . Second , if you have it it dragges across the screen and the end of the tool is too wide . Then what do you do with it to keep it clean ? ? lost it again ... .	-1
This is not convenient to use as there is n't a place to store it . The iPhone is so sensitive to the touch , it 's easier to just use my fingers ...	-1
This stylus comes apart really easily and feels super cheap . I ESPECIALLY would not recommend it to people with small children around	-1
I had no luck with this . The order was lost but the friendly customer service people sent a replacement immediately upon notification ... and added a second free one ... so no complaints there . One of them fell apart after a couple of days and neither of them worked well .	-1
Does n't work with an Otterbox Defender case ! Never tried it without , so 1 star is all I know to give .	-1
The product is well made , but does not work with iPhone . You can type if you press really hard . But you can no navigate or flick the screen . Therefore , it does n't work .	-1
In an effort to find something to use instead of my fingers for certain things on my phone I figured this was a good buy . When using this it was a little difficult to use and would not even work , so even though it was not expensive , save your money for something else .	-1
This cable is pretty big but the reason I give it two stars its because it works sometimes and mostly it Does n't .	-1
I was very impressed with the seller 's delivery . My item arrived a month early . However the product had problems . Both ends of the splitter cable were loose when I connected my headphones and did not stay in very well on their own . One of the ends on the splitter cable did not work . I would ship back and demand a replacement , but the cost to ship it back to Hong Kong is way more than the $ 1.10 I paid for it . Overall , I do not recommend this to anyone and I will not be ordering from this seller again .	-1
Unfortunately one side of the splitter does n't work . I do n't recommend it , since it takes more work to ship it back than to throw it out and buy another one .	-1
I bought this to split the audio from my computer to two sources , seems simple enough but after a while we noticed only the right channel was working , so I unplugged the splitter to find the tip of the plug ( approx . the first 1/8 & # 34 ; ) had broken off inside my computer audio port . Not only did ruin the plug but now I ca n't plug any other jacks in to the computer audio outlet port because the broken piece is stuck in there . So now my computer is permanently crippled and limited to one channel due to this poorly made product . Remember you get what you pay for !	-1
This charger is not the most reliable in terms of performance . I ca n't always get the charger to charge my phone and even when it does charge , it is very slow . It is very inexpensive but other than that , I would n't recommend it .	-1
The case is not what I expected and i feel like it wo n't protect my phone so I wo n't be using it . The shipper was great though would buy from this company again	-1
It looks beautiful in person . It 's light and stays out of the way . But it does n't work all that well . You see the inside of the cradle is slick , so smooth in fact , that if you casually place your Blackberry inside of it , it will fall over . So slick that when you put your Blackberry in and plug it up , you have no way of knowing for sure if the device has made contact with the two prongs ( see product image ) that allow it to recharge . So you 've got to lean in and look on your Blackberry to see if the lightning bolt which indicates charging is actually on . But be careful , do n't bump your desk - you may knock the device out ! Or you may make it slip off the two prongs . lolA better idea would have been to place a rubber of matted plastic inside the charging pod to keep your BB firmly in place.Oh - since it does n't sync while you 're using the pod to charge , sometimes I sit it in the pod/cradle and plug it directly in the BB so it can sync but sit upright . Bad idea . The weight of the power cord on the side of the BB will cause it to slip out of the SLICK pod . ... .Luckily I paid way below retail . Or I would be pretty upset .	-1
If you only want a desktop charger this is okay . It only charges the phone and the charger has to be hooked up to a USB port on a computer . It does n't allow access to the phone through the `` Blackberry Manager '' . If you want to charge your phone use the cable provided and keep your desk clear of this charging pod .	-1
The point of a case is to protect your phone . This case does not do that well . I had been using it for a couple of weeks and it worked fine . I did n't like that I could not dock it with the case on but that is just nit picky.One day I was sitting on a curb waiting for a taxi to take me to the football game when my phone slid off my lap . It fell a total of 6-12 inches max . It landed on the bottom corner and the case just split open . Either side of it fell off and my phone then landed on the front glass CRACKING THE SCREEN ! After much reading I found that these screens are pretty durable so I assume it was a fluke and must have hit a small pebble just right . Either way if the case would have done its job right and not fell off my phone would not now be cracked.Luckily the phone works fine just has a large crack which is more of an annoyance and weak spot if any . Thanks to Apple and AT & T ; to fix this costs ~ $ 200 so that will not be happening . I ended up getting the griffin easy dock case and it works great and is much more of a sturdy design .	-1
I agree with all the positive points that the other reviewers have said . This could be an ideal case , but after only 2 weeks the clips that hold the two halfs together started breaking . I kept it together with electricians tape until they all broke off . Bargain cell was great and immediately sent me a replacement but after 2 days already one cip broke . Unfortunately without the clips the thing does n't work . I 'd gladly pay a dollar more to have the clips work properly , but as it is I 've ordered a silicone case .	-1
This product did n't even last me 2 weeks . I never dropped it and it usually stayed in my purse or on my desk but it started cracking around the connection areas . I had to order another cover to replace it . I 'm now using the Belkin Vue and it 's working out great .	-1
I wish there had been some reviews to read before I bought this ! Basically , it does what it says . It protects your privacy . No one can see the screen unless they 're pretty much directly in front of it.However ... this is a two-piece set . It comes with a glossy screen protector that protects the whole front of the iphone . You 're supposed to put that down first , then put the privacy film on top of it . I did it backwards , and that screwed everything up.But even if you did it right , here are the four problems associated with it:1. the film is quite thick - try to picture this - it 's about 3 times as thick as the glossy screen protector ( the standard screen protector that comes with or without the privacy film ) . Keep in mind the glossy screen protector is super thin and when you have that on your phone you hardly notice it . The privacy film though is thick enough that it creates a ridge that your finger can definitely feel as it runs across it . ( By the way , the privacy film just covers the lighted part of the iphone screen - not the entire face ) . So the privacy film sits on top of the glossy screen protector - and there 's this ridge there . A ridge that can get caught on things when you put the phone in your pocket or purse . I 'm sure it wo n't last long in daily use.I accidentally installed all of this backwards from the way they recommended . I put the privacy film down first , then the glossy protector on top of it . It works okay , and it eliminates the `` ridge '' problem . The film will now not get caught on anything and ripped off because it 's covered by the glossy protector . However , the glossy protector does n't fit over it perfectly - leaving a lot of bubbles outside of the screen area . This is no doubt why they recommend installing it the other way around ! 2 . The privacy film really dims your screen.3 . With this doubling up of films and protectors the screen loses a noticeable amount of sensitivity , and you have to press harder for it to recognize your commands . This is really a pain after awhile.4 . The privacy film got a tiny little bubble that just wo n't go away . I can push it around with my thumb , but it just comes back when I 'm finished ! It sounds like a great idea in theory , but I 'm not sure in practice it 's really going to be worth it . I find myself now weighing the benefits & costs.Benefit : no one can see my screen but meCosts : I have to look at a much darker screen , there are little bubbles that ca n't be removed , and the whole thing 's not going to last very long anyway ! Then I think : privacy protection sounds good , but really - in real life - how often has my privacy been violated by someone looking at my screen ? I 'm not sure it has ever happened . And if it did happen , it has caused me no harm . So why not just be careful whose around when you pull the phone out and dump the whole privacy film bit !	-1
It sticks , stays for a day and after that sides of it starts coming off . Does n't matter how I installed it , I tried everything ... it still comes off . Not a good quality at all . I went and got protection sheets from AT & T store ... the one I used a year ago still stays on and works great ! Do n't waste your money .	-1
It protects the iPhone screen but I find it hard to install without creating bubbles under it . If there is any dust particles got under the screen when you put it on , you will get bubbles.It does not last very long , it looks like I may have to get another one soon .	-1
Original review , posted in August of this year-I bought this case for my iPhone 3G , and I am very pleased with it . The magnetic closure has not interfered with my iPhone in any way , and the belt loops make this holster very , very secure . The phone is easily removed when needed . I bought this to replace theDLO Leather Holster Case for iPhone 3G , 3G S ( Black ) , when the belt clip began to become loose ; if you want to make SURE that you never loose your iPhone because of a lost holster , the PC Microstore holster with belt clip AND belt loops is the way to go . I had the unfortunate experience of losing a Motorola Razr when another holster 's belt clip slipped off my pocket ; an honest person turned the phone in , but not before it had been stepped on and the glass front broken . Do you really want to risk losing your Iphone in such an accident ? At the offering price , I feel that this iPhone case is one of the best deals available on all of Amazon 's web site.Follow-up , December 2009-My wife recently upgraded to an iPhone , so I ordered two more of these cases , still at a great price . While they seemed very similar to the items I received in August , they are of MUCH poorer quality- the belt loops broke in a mere three weeks of usage . I have contacted pcmicrostore about a refund or replacement through Amazon , and I 'm waiting for their response . The cases received in November have a small logo on the front , but the ones I received in August did not . I have resumed use of the case received in August , which is somewhat worn and with stretched belt loops that are nevertheless still intact . It seems as though pcmicrostore has changed suppliers , without bothering to let Amazon ( or anyone else , for that matter ) know that they had done so . I can no longer recommend this phone case because of its poor workmanship .	-1
The holster is too big for the iphone ( 3G ) and does not have a snug fit . Found another holster that was smaller that I liked better .	-1
WARNING : If you want to save your time , money , and iPhone , never consider this crappy item.The holster has one metal clip at the center and two loop straps to hold a pants belt . The imitation leather skin is actually thin cloth sandwiching cardboard paper.In less than 3 days after my purchase , one of the loop straps tore off at its stitches to the case body.Another 2 weeks passed and I found the metal clip was missing and the holster barely hanging with the remaining loop strap . I was only lucky I found it before my iPhone would fall onto a concrete floor.Nothing more to say .	-1
This is an attractive case with a black vinyl exterior ( NOT leather & I do n't understand why Amazon allows this claim ) & a padded yellow interior . The sides stretch & it was a good fit for my 3GS . The phone is secured by a large flap & magnetic catches . There is a clip in the center of the case with loops on either side of it to attach to a belt . It can only be worn in the horizontal position only , I prefer vertical . The clip is not very strong & will work itself free of the belt . I used to loops to prevent my phone from escaping ( strange how they always manage to find a pool of water to dive into ) , but the loops broke after a few weeks . And the metal clip broke through the vinyl covering . So , is it worth $ 3 ? Only if you plan on using it for 2 months .	-1
This is crap . The case is so small it does not fit the iphone or our vibrant . The case they sent looks nothing like what I ordered . It is small and has snap loops instead of permanent ones like the picture . BUT IT WAS SO CHEAP it would cost more to return it than its worth .	-1
Good case but bulky and too tight on the phone . Always had to force iphone and ends up giving this up due to this problem .	-1
you get what you pay for ... . you pay cheap because it is cheap ... . the leather texture is some sort of flimsy ( not to mention ) thin covering that peeled off simply trying to put this on my belt . its a basic pouch , flap , magnet design . To add insult to injury the magnet isnt even a strong one . dont know how many times my phone fell out of the case from actions as simple as getting into my truck and having it bump into the seat .	-1
You have to get a very very thin case for it to work on this case . And the belt loops broke after 3 months of use . I got the Grantwood iPhone holster instead .	-1

This case does not fit Blackberry storm , although the seller claims it does.The case is too small for storm with Silicone skin and too big for naked storm ( the phone bangs side to side ) .	-1
Either by a poor decription , or confusing pictures by Amazon , I ordered this case for an iPhone 4 . It is much too short . When looking at the various views , there are no less than 3 different items shown . I hope I can get my money back , which is mostly in shipping . I can not comment on the quality of the case as it does not fit .	-1
Pros1 ) Compact design.Cons1 ) Sound quality is scratchy.2 ) Speakerphone function does not allow to answer incoming calls suing skype .	-1
Easy to follow instructions and may actually work with a phone but would not pair or connect to my mac laptop which is what I bought it for . Very disappointed in Amazon as nowhere on the first 2 pages is there any mention that this piece of junk is a bluetooth technology item . 4 pages in there ; s mention and reviews but should have been labelled Motorola Bluetooth Speaker . Also in fine print on box is statement you might have to buy a bluetooth adapter for pc so I assume for mac also . Waste of time and I also expect to be hit with return postage for an item not designed for the purpose I purchased it	-1
Bought this and it broke . I do n't even know why I wasted my time , was n't even that long of a cord ... Purchase this for your phone ! B00DV2OQFYthe product is way better and is actually correct length & durability .	-1
If you are interested in this product then be sure to read the 3 star reviews . I made the mistake of not doing that , I do not know why they gave it 3 stars when they state obvious flaws that make the case not worth having.My case broke after 2 weeks , and I never even dropped it . It 's a snazzy looking case and looks nice on the phone but it has to many flaws.It comes in 2 pieces and when you put it on your iphone it connects in the middle . That is the biggest flaw . Most people hold their phone by the middle not the ends . So when you grab the phone or move it around in your hand/pocket you tend to disconnect the pieces.The other issue is the connecting flaps that plug into eachother to complete the case . They are flimsy and will break easily after reattaching many times . My right side flap has already broken off and now its chipped where it was . Also the color blue is wearing off on the back of the circle already.DO NOT BUY .	-1
I bought this case because I wanted to purchase a sturdy reliable case for my iPhones 3gs . This case is terrible . It not only lets in dust and dirt that will scratch the back of your phone over time the 2 parts that allow the case to fit together always come apart . The plastic that the case is made from is also very brittle . it eventually begins to chip away over time thus leaving areas of your phone exposed . It 's a terrible case and a waste of money !	-1
I bought this cover with my phone at the att store . I liked the design of the cover and that there was virtually no lip between the cover and the screen . However , I really disappointed with this cover . Here 's the main problems I have with it:1 . It does n't fit over my screen protecter very well . One corner of the screen protecter keeps coming up.2 . It 's leaving marks on my phone . When I took the cover off the other day I saw that it had rubbed the red coloring onto my phone . Luckily this wiped off but I do n't like the fact that its rubbing against the phone.3 . This is my biggest problem with the case . IT DOES N'T STAY ON ! ! This case does not lock together and it is constantly coming apart . I find that if put my phone in my pocket that when I pull it back up I end up pulling just the case and not the phone . What good is a case if its constantly coming off ! I do not like this case and would not suggest anyone to buy it ! I would suggest finding one that either slips over the phone ( like the gel type covers ) or one that truly snaps around the phone .	-1
The small piece below the home button breaks right away . It also broke where it comes together , so now the two peices slip apart all the time .	-1
bought 2 of these - 1 broke putting in on the phone . the other will not stay together . Look elsewhere for a case .	-1
This is a nice looking case , but made of cheap plastic and not well formed . There are a couple of small plastic guide tabs that are supposed to fit under the split section of the case , that I had to constantly push in to fit . But mainly , it was unusable for me . I have a holster that I place my iphone into . Every time I remove the phone from the holster , this case splits in half and leaves one side or the other in the holster . So it 's completely useless to me.I got this on one of those Amazon Gold special deals , so I was only out a couple bucks . I just threw it away . Still looking for a better case.As an aside , I have now purchased 3 different Frogz products , and each one has been total crap .	-1
Two things make me recommend NOT buying this case:1 . The bump in the back that is apparently supposed to hold the two halves together : what it ends up doing is tilting the phone backwards slightly whenever you put it down , which makes it that much harder to see the screen . ( It also does n't hold the two halves together ) .2 . Every time I attach headphones , the case slides up and I have to reattach it . This is beyond annoying.Another note : Because this case is listed separately for each color , my bad review is only going to show up under pink unless I copy it to the other colors . There is NO difference between the various colors , and one review would apply to them all .	-1
The e-mail I sent to Phonenerds was never responded to . The case came close to the outside of the delivery deadline . The case fits on the phone and is loose .	-1
This case does look nice , but the connection between the two pieces is very flimsy plastic and fell apart after about a week . I do not recommend this item .	-1
The green color is really cute . I bought it to replace a pink one that I bought at the AT & T store for much more money . However , the green case broke in the exact same places as indicated in the other users ' photos . This was within a couple weeks of getting it . What the heck ? Thank goodness Amazon has an amazing return policy . I was disappointed as the pink ifrogz case withstood a lot of abuse from my toddler .	-1
The one positive thing I can say is that despite my expectations , the thin piece of plastic over the front of the bottom piece has n't snapped ... yet . I got this case as a freebie when I bought my iPhone . My wife liked the color of it . Over the course of the next two weeks I nearly dropped my phone several times because the bottom piece slid off as I was taking it out of my pocket . It simply wo n't stay on . It 's not very snug against the phone either . There are gaps at the top and bottom so when I plug in headphones or the docking cable it slides up and down in the case . Simply poor design . I got it for free and I want my money back .	-1
I bought both myself and my girlfriend one of these cases ... both of us take care of our belongings , yet simply from pulling it in and out of our pockets , the `` bump '' used to hold the top half to the bottom half wore down ... After three months , when reaching in my pocket for my phone , I 'd only get half of a case , making me miss my calls.If you have an extra $ 10 bucks to spare , it definitely will protect your phone ... but you 'll be forking out another $ 10 bucks to replace it in 2-3 months .	-1
I made the mistake of purchasing one of these at the AT & T store for a ridiculous price compared to Amazon . Perhaps for $ 10 it is worth having , but my cases has already worn away the color around the edges of the screen from playing games and using the phone . I have n't had it for much longer than a month and the wear started to show very quickly . Now instead of looking like a cool metallic case , it looks like a cheap while plastic case that was once painted a cool metallic color . Not good quality .	-1
I got this case one and loved it then got it a second time and it was a total piece of crap . It lasted like 3 weeks . The first one was great and lasted 6 months or more . The second one would not stay together on my phone kept falling apart .	-1
After just 2 days of normal use , the blue paint begins to peel off ! Silver-metal material is showing . It looks ugly ! I would never buy it again .	-1
SO I just got this today , aug 25 08 and the back of it is not smooth like in the photo . The one I got has sort of a wood grain look to it . So before you order send an email first just to make sure you get the one in the photo .	-1
I have iPhone 3GS in Outerbox protective case . This Armband Case is too small to fit with the Outerbox case and I do n't want to take the Outerbox case every time I want to use the Armband . Waste of money .	-1
I had no idea when purchasing this product that it would not fit on the arm of anyone under 400 pounds . The band is not made to be fitted to anyone smaller .	-1
This is the `` I get what I pay for '' . It is cheap looking and it is bulky . It looks better in picture . I will probably use it when people are not looking or where there is not a crowd . LOL .	-1
I guess you get what you pay for ... the Plastic does not work well with the touch screen.. now that really sucks ... I tried cutting it out ... afraid the iphone might come out ... . So , I 'm back to just holding while running ...	-1
These cables work as advertised , but they break with almost no effort at all . Spend a little extra and get a good cable .	-1
I carry my phone in my pocket . the case is slim and has a great texture , But the little clips that hold the case halves together started breaking after the second week . Now a month later , it 's super glued together in three spots : - {	-1
What can I say ? The clips to keep it tight broke after maybe one week of use.It was a cheap product but not even worth the value I paid for ... Unfortunately , not worth the shipment price either.Do not waste your money on this junk !	-1
The Screen Protector Shield that is included with this case cover does not fit the iPhone 3G . If you align it to the `` home '' button , the Screen Protector Shield is too long on the bottom and covers the chrome trim . If you align it to the bottom of the screen , it covers part of the `` home '' button.There is also a weird cutout on the upper left which does not align with the cutout of the case cover.Additionally , the Screen Protector Shield scratches VERY easily.If you 're purchasing this case cover , factor in the cost of purchasing a separate screen protector in the cost because the included Screen Protector Shield is useless.Also , purchase from one of the other merchants listed besides PC Micro Store . PC Micro Store 's shipping is slow . It took a week for me to receive this and I live in the same city as them .	-1
I did n't like this prodct . I dropped my phone on my carpeted floor and the corner broke , so that I could not use the cover . The sheild was very hard to put on the screen . It was very difficult to get the air bubbles out . It also darkened tte screen on the phone .	-1
MY EARLOBE TURN RED AFTER WEARING IT FOR 1 HOUR . THERE IS NO PADS TO PROTECT THE EARLOBES . EVERY TIME WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD , THE WIRE STICK TO YOUR SKIN AND PULL ON THE EAR PIECES . SOUND SYSTEM CUT IN AND OUT . YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE EAR PIECES TOGETHER WITH YOUR HANDS ALL THE TIME IF YOU WANT IT SOUND CLEARER . WHO IS THE IDIOT THAT DESIGN THIS ?	-1
Here we go ... +++ The Pros+ Sweat and moisture resistant+ Comes with mesh pouch for easy carrying+ Charge stand uses standard mini-usb connection ( easy cable replacement if lost ) + Pairing is easy and reliable+ Design is sleek and minimalistic+ Great sound and isolation -- - The Cons- Buttons are hard to press- Frustratingly hard to get the earbuds to seat , and even after they 're seated they do n't stay that way*** The DetailsI 've gone through noise-cancelling headphones ( Sennheiser PX200 ) and sound isolating earbuds ( Shure E3 ) , The Senns are nice , but I find that carrying around the extra heft of the noise-canceling unit and wires to be more hassle than worth . So into the product researching fray I went and re-emerged with the Shures.The Shures are also great , none of the heft and plenty of isolation ( being ear-canal phones ) . But again , WIRES ! ! Rolling them up when not in use , untangling them when ready to use and the extra hassle in cold weather of figuring out how to stay tethered to my music player . Back into the frary ... After some more product research , I decided to go with the Bluetooth wireless option and at the time the only products that I could seem to find consistently decent reviews are the Jaybird JB-200 and the Motorola S9 . Finally deciding on the Jaybirds based on all the positive media reviews on their website.Unfortunately I 've never been able to get a good fit and I 've read through the manual numerous times and watched the you-tube video with the CEO showing how to put them on , all to no avail and the set ended up serving no other purpose than to waste space.The problem is the actual speaker ; where other earbuds have a narrow speaker and the earpieces that fit over them are flexible material that compress into your ear and then flange out ... The Jaybird has a flat and wide speaker ( like 1/4 '' diameter ) and with the earpiece on now you 're looking at trying to shove something about 5/8 '' diameter far enough into your ear so it stays there.Sadly , I 'm not someone with an ear makeup that can accommodate that . And instead of Jaybird literature pushing how important a good fit is ( which is incorrect because not everyone has the same ear opening ) , maybe they should try also suggesting that folks that ca n't pre-try the headphones find something of the same dimensions to test the fit first .	-1
This was not worth the money spent , it worked well but no quality on the design and durability . I asked for a refund but could not after 30 days .	-1
I 'll keep this brief.Other headsets I 've used : Several cheapos from woot.com , Jawbone ( original ) , Invisio G5 , Jawbone Icon , Jawbone Era , Plantronics Voyager ProPROS1 . ) Comfortable2 . ) Battery life seems decent3 . ) Sound quality out of earpiece is fine4 . ) Handy base station for charging5 . ) Mostly performs like it 's supposed to , i.e . does n't display any kind of buggy behavior ( my biggest critique of my Jawbone headsets ) CONS1 . ) Mediocre range2 . ) I get lots of static when I move around with the phone ( tried it on a Palm Pre and a Samsung Galaxy S II ) , both with the phone stationary and with it in my pocket3 . ) My callers complain of static and background noise4 . ) Proprietary ( i.e . not mini or micro USB ) charging cable5 . ) A bit clunkyCONCLUSIONWhile this may have been a quality headset when it was released , it 's simply outdated now . You can do better for the money . I have snow tires on my car , and the noise is loud enough that I ca n't use this headset while driving because my callers complain of the racket . My cheapo ( & lt ; $ 15 ) headsets perform equally well as this one.As of this writing ( 11/21/2011 ) , I recommend the Jawbone Icon with Jabra eargels as the go-to headset . If you want to throw more cash at it , the Jawbone Era ( also with Jabra eargels ) is a better headset but perhaps not worth the premium price unless you plan to spend quite a lot of time using it . The Plantronics Voyager Pro is also a significantly better headset than this one.Chris	-1
I bought this product based on all the positive reviews I read , but I was pretty disappointed by the product . First , if you wear it on the opposite ear from where your phone is clipped , you get a lot of static , which never happened with my Motorola headset . Second , having to fit the thing in your ear is a MAJOR hassle ( it is designed to fit just inside your ear canal ) . Third , it seems to have VERY poor battery life . I get about 1 day of standby and 1 hour of talk time . I was actually on the phone with someone a day after the thing was fully charged , and had n't used it to that point , but yet it died out less than an hour into the conversation . The sound quality is decent , but it does n't make up for the shortcomings . I will say though , that Amazon has pretty amazing customer service . I forgot to enter my new address into the order , so it got sent to the wrong address , but Amazon promptly overnighted me a unit free of charge .	-1
My experience may be atypical , but the battery on this headset stopped recharging after 6 months . I use two different types of charger bought at different times so I know the charger is not the cause .	-1
I was told this was an excellent product by someone who owns it , So I tried it . After trying two other bluetooth headsets before this , I wanted one that people could finally hear me without background noise . This is not it . Everyone had trouble hearing me on it , saying it was static and scratchy . I think its time to bite the bullet and get a jawbone .	-1
When this product showed up it looked used . and by that it was not in the box properly , it was missing the manual and the box was ratty . Did not seem new at all .	-1
Large ear piece did not fit in my ear . Very uncomfortable . Ear piece was broken upon receipt . Charger is not standard . Recommend that you keep looking .	-1
I get noise when using this device . Also , the people I talk to tell me they can not hear me well . I 'm returning this and ordering a different type . Except for the noise it works well . It holds the charge , it was easy to pair with my phone , an LG Rumor touch . It looks ok , I can answer , hang up and redial the last number without having to use the phone .	-1
I had been very happy with thePlantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headsetwould have kept this one for years , as it perfectly satisfied all of my needs . But I had an accident with the one that I reviewed here in 2009 , so I decided to see what other Plantronics Bluetooth headsets were available.Picked up thisPlantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headsetas it had been recommended by a friend as a reasonably priced alternative , which it is . It 's certainly better than my older Motorola H500-series Bluetooth headsets , but not quite in the same league as the Plantronics Voyager PRO series , and for a number of reasons.Likes : + Very simple setup and pairing ; could n't be easier+ Excellent battery life ; easily meets 8 hours of talk time+ Comfortable earloop ; swivels to fit either ear+ Excellent and clearly written instructions+ Works with Skype through the computer+ Good one-button controlsCompromises : * Wind noise higher than expected ; oyager PRO series is far better* Moderate noise cancellation ; Voyager PRO series is far better* Claimed range of `` up to 33 feet '' was rareDislikes : - High static levels ; annoying to parties on the other end- Proprietary plug on the charger ; should be a standard Micro USB- Junky plastic desk charging cradle ; not worthy of the Plantronics name- Soft plastic separated on the earloop ; had to fix with SuperGlue , more than onceRegular Use : As noted in the beginning , this was picked up as reasonably priced alternative to the Plantronics Voyager PRO series . I 'm neutral on the design of this Voyager 520 , though the chrome look could have been muted and not so glitzy , but it was the ability to communicate and sometimes for extended periods that was important . In that , this headsetdid well except for the occasional high static levels experienced , where none had been there with the older Voyager PRO ( and more on this later ) .But ... the two-piece ear loop separated and had to be glued together , and this had to be done a few times . Once I lost the soft plastic part for a couple of days and luckily found it . The last time , I cleaned both parts carefully with isopropyl alcohol before using the SuperGlue , and so far it has held . This is apparently a common problem as I found on the Plantronics site when I went to see if they had a tech solution . Plantronics needs to go back to the drawing board on this.But my biggest complaint is that this Plantronics Voyager 520 requires a proprietary plug for charging in a world that has gone to Micro USB plugs . In fact , the Plantronics Voyager PRO HD , Voyager PRO+ , Discovery 975 , Savor M1100 , M100 , and even their discontinued Explorer 240 , 360 and 390 all use the universal Micro USB plugs for charging , so why should this model be different ? Plantronics needs to work on their charging connector.It may not matter that much , but note that this Plantronics Voyager 520 Bluetooth Headset is listed here as Item model number : 75859-01 . On the Plantronics site , it 's listed as P/N : 75859-01 , and according to them , the `` Product is Discontinued '' so be aware of that.All this being said , I moved on to thePlantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headsetearlier this year , and like it 's earlier PRO series sibling it 's a 5-star offering . The Voyager 520 has been set aside as a backup , and so far it has n't been needed . I could have gone for thePlantronics Voyager Pro HDbut in truth did n't know if I would have used all of its extra features . There are other more economical models to pick from , such as the highly-ratedPlantronics M50 ( which does have micro USB charging ) , but as a loyal fan of this company 's products , I would suggest steering away from this Voyager 520 Headset ... you 'll be happier with others.7/28/2012	-1
Extremely disappointed in performance . Literally would have to either hold the phone next to my ear or set it on my shoulder for the bluetooth to be clear without static . Also , if you moved more than 8 - 10 feet away it would literally disconnect itself from my cell . I took the cheap way out to buy an inexpensive bluetooth , and I guess I got what I paid for , and less . WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ! ! ! The only positive thing I can say it was comfortable on my ear .	-1
I have had many Bluetooth headsets and this one is one of the worse . So far my favorite is still the Voyager 510 . This one is really terrible in that it picks up even the slightest background noise despite what Plantronics advertises it as a noise-cancelling headset it is completely the opposite . I even called them and they claimed it was defective and the replacement was no different . I will stick with the trusty Voyager 510 .	-1
Got it September 2012 , the background noise was always horrible , and became really bad when the phone was not close to the bluetooth device . If the device is in my right ear and my phone is in my left pocket the noise is unbearable . and after three months of use this thing dies under a minute of being connected to my phone.Guess you get what you pay for . I like how chunky it is because it stays put in my ear not like the new light ones that you do n't know if they are on your ear or not .	-1
Returned it , It looks like and OLD HUGE Star Track headset ! Out dated Large and tacky draws attention thuggish looking . I didnt realize it was soo gaudy looking its HUGE the only reason I gave it 1 stars is it does work but I would not wear it to work or in public ... . It should be taken off the market , I think but to each his own ! Huge and Shiney ! lol ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
this itiem is terrible plenty of back ground noise and static . I ordered 2 and find this to be a hugh mistake .	-1
It never felt good while wearing it . Just pain , pain , pain ! ! Do n't waste your money on this thing . You can have mine for 1/3 price.it was very hard to pair . As well .	-1
Purchased 3 in retail pack . The packaging has NO & # 34 ; Plantronics & # 34 ; name , logo , or part numbers . This product may be chinese counterfeit .	-1
I spent the extra bucks to buy a Plantronics . Unfortunately , I quit using the headset after my callers complained about the call quality .	-1
The Nokia BH-503 Stereo Headset ( Black ) is cumbersome and really not worth the purchase when there are other headset products with similar price points that also include FM radio.If you do decide to order the Nokia BH-503 Stereo Headset ( Black ) you need to consider purchasing extra ear pads.The headset is n't adjustable or comfortable.The only positive that can be submitted regarding this headset is that the music is clear and the phone calls are equally clear .	-1
This works great.Pros -You can watch movies from netflix , youtube , quicktime , TV.com or any other movie player or video app from your iphone to your tv . You can even watch your images on the big screen when you look at them through a slideshow.Cons -It does n't come with a power cord , and it 's not a standard USB plug . I 'm still trying to figure out what type of plug I need for this . Until then I just make sure the iPhone is fully charged before plugging it into the TV.UPDATE : 2/25/12 - It still connects great to the iphone and we did find a cord to plug into it . The problem though is that the soldering on the power cord plug is weak and from just hanging it easily jiggled it loose . We can no longer charge our Iphones while watching videos from them . This means we need at least a little bit of a charge before watching shows : ( This really lowered the effectiveness of this product and has changed my rating from 5 stars to 2 .	-1
Do n't waste your money . This will work , but at what cost . You pay $ 25 more than it is worth . Unless you plan on watching the video on a screen smaller than 20 inches I would not buy this .	-1
At first , this cable did what it said . It connects your iphone/ipad/ipod to a video or audio device through an AV connection . ( I.e . one yellow cable for video and a red and white cable for left and right audio ) . It has a micro-usb power input , so if you have a micro-usb cable , you can power your device while it 's running video or audio.Within a week , I was no longer getting a reliable connection - I would have to wiggle the cable or carefully put things under the cable to raise it relative to the iphone , or would n't get output . A few weeks after that , and I ca n't get a connection at all . I do n't know if it 's a manufacturing issue , a design issue , or if the weight of the cable just degrades the connection after a while . Maybe a dock would be a better choice . If you buy this , I would recommend saving the packaging in case you need a return.Another word of caution : under the standard Apple operating system , not all applications support `` video out '' through the port at the bottom of the device . For example , Netflix currently supports video out for the iphone 4 and ipad , but not for earlier iphones or for ipods . So you ca n't take a factory spec device and expect to mirror the home screen or anything like that , but you can play the stuff that the Apple operating system wants you to play.I have a `` jailbroken '' iphone 3g running tvout2 mirror , a non istore app that mirrors all output to the cable . Using that , Netflix runs great on my 3g with this cable , at least when the cable is working . ( Google for info on jailbreaking or tvout2 mirror , but proceed at your own risk ) .	-1
Well at first it did work like for the 1st try then it got bad did n't work at all I bought for nothing do n't even buy it ... :	-1
We had ordered this for Our daughter for her phone . Looking at picture and according to description it had a hard case with rubber outer print . Needed something sturdy for our teenager . Useless because its plastic and the first time she drops it , it will break because she had one like the one we received and it had already broke the first time it was bumped . Would by from seller again but will pay closer attention to desription and picture	-1
The look is cool ! But getting it on and off was not easy ! So now it sits in a drawer collecting dust !	-1
SummaryThe Nokia N96 is an expensive phone that competes against many rival companies that have done their homework over the years to provide competitive products against this phone-dominating firm . The N96 fails to be able to be a leader in its phone class , with issues that are problematic of a phone years older . The few positives of the N96 do not command the high purchase price.Background : I used the N96 with AT & T ; service in the US . My local areas has extensive 3G coverage so I was always able to get a solid 3G , fast , connection ( Note I do not have any LiveTV service in my area ) . My normal phones I use are the Iphone 3G and the Samsung Blackjack II ( windows mobile ) . I am a rather geeky person who enjoys tinkering with phones and computers so I will provide an assessment from a user-experience in comparison to the two phones I 've cited , which I use often on the same 3G service ; for those who are n't aware , GSM phones have sim cards that can be popped into different phones so are n't `` tied '' to a specific piece of hardware ( i.e . Verizon , Sprint ) .Unboxing : The N96 comes in a very nice retail box . This is typical of Nokia 's products , placing a high degree of emphasis on packaging . It sets off a nice first impression of the product.Build : Overall the phone has a mirrored surface for its LCD and a shiny black glossy surface for the rest of the phone . The black does attract fingerprints and at first this tends to put people off . However , after a while the fingerprint effect psychologically diminishes upon itself so you do not really care.The keys are only average in tactile feel and comparable to a regular $ 200 phone . This is surprising since I thought a top of the line phone would have quality keys with a firm solid response . Not so here . The keys spacing are not conducive to one-hand dialing without looking at the unit.The LCD is beautiful , with crisp text and accurate color display . If there 's anything that 's very well engineered on this phone it will be the LCD and camera ( more on that below ) . Truly world-class , I have n't quite seen an LCD look as good as on this phone.The camera is really good on this phone . Quite a far cry from the iphone and other Windows mobile phones . Pictures come out reasonably sharp in daylight . Low light is poor , but again , that 's nothing unusual from any camera phone and the quality is still leaps and bounds better than the iphone . The camera does have a very bright LED that can amazingly light up a dead-dark environment a few feet ahead at max range.The exterior speaker is loud enough but only average in quality with a slightly tinny output . I believe that my blackjack II 's speaker is louder and cleaner in output , not significantly so , but enough to be noticeable.The rear kickstand , a widely marketed feature , is a pure gimmick that is poorly designed . Because it is not directly in the middle of the unit , the weight is not properly balanced . This means that an uneven surface , or a slight breeze could topple the unit over . Tacky , I was so full of disgust when I tried it myself . Needs to be completely reengineered or gotten rid of entirely.The ports are that of a micro USB , headphone , and power port . Nokia has decided not to use the USB port for power , however , so you have to lug around the power plug during travel if you take your laptop with you . Not cool ! There are no rubber boots for the ports on the phone . Not a good sign - -water seepage can end up being a problem here . And for those who say those boots tear off anyway , that is not necessarily true . My old Blackjack II phone never had any of its boots torn off even though I heavily `` abused '' it for a year by inserting an removing countless times.Battery life is mediocre . I could get about a day 's worth of use with heavy web browsing and a few phone calls . The battery gets much hotter than a normal smartphone does when in heavy discharge/charge mode . It would be nice if Nokia could address this issue by producing a phone that does n't feel like a mini hot plate to your face or hand.Accessories : The included car charger is a strange size . It could not fit into my cig lighter . Fortunately , I had a car charger from a different Nokia model that was compatible . There is a proper USB cable included , which is a good thing since not everyone has a microUSB ported type of cable . The travel charger is small enough . There is no MicroSD card included , but these are cheap enough to buy for anyone who needs more than the regular 16GB of built in memory . It 's really nice that the memory is expandable like this , compared to the iphone where you are locked out from expansion options . For music lovers , this means you can have a max of 24GB of memory and 16GB microsd 's are on there way over soon , so that would mean 32gb of storage . Not bad ! Interface and response : The user interface is typical Nokia sybian . That is , the menu set is fairly straight forward in operation . The phone , however , has a sluggish feel to it . Programs load sluggishly , making you wonder if you pressed the right button to launch it . After a bit , the lag finally catches up . I expect such typical behavior from a Windows Mobile phone , but the fact a Symbian phone does this is clearly unacceptable . I 'm not sure why the phone is so slow in execution ; supposedly this phone lacks a multimedia processor and is clocked very low . Regardless , it simply is slow , and that 's all that matters to the end-user who will feel upset waiting at the response times . This issue likely extends into the browser.The built-in web browser is much better than IE for windows mobile . However , it is much worse than the Iphone 's browser . Pages render fairly well but loading is slow and scrolling stutters . Although the phone was capable of launching youtube videos from the regular youtube site , there was so much stuttering going on that it was useless . Resource intensive sites like CNN are too slow to load , making it painful to view . Zooming was horrible and nonintuitive . Again , this was a common issue on old phones from the early 2000s , but a top of the line phone for 2009 ? The Iphone , by comparison , breezes through the most intense sites with ease . This is sadly not a good web browsing phone . Since a 3G data plan with AT & T ; is so expensive , some of us would like a phone that 's capable of browsing like an Iphone does . Ca n't do that here.The phone does not support an international character set out of the box . If you want to to view Chinese , for example , you can not do this unless you mail in your phone to a Nokia service center . This is a ludicrous option ( did we timewarp to 1999 ? ) in a time when extras should be downloadable from the manufacturer , even for a fee . Since there 's only one Nokia service center in the entire USA , you have to wait a long time for the turnaround . To go without a phone that long is unacceptable . The Iphone , by comparison , supports International characters right out of the box ! The java stack on the N96 is awful . It 's too sensitive to security prohibitions and runs sluggishly , again . I tried running Opera Mini , a java app , and it kept giving me security warnings every time I launched it , with no way to bypass those warnings . The Opera mini program ran much slower than on my Blackjack II , a reflection , again , on the slow processing speed of the N96.The included GPS program was incredibly slow ( do I hear an echo ? ) compared to the free Google Maps I 've used on the iphone and the Blackjack . Scrolling just to browse a map was painful and not something I could have any fun with . In contrast , I love being able to just browse the maps on my other phones because it 's quick and efficient.The N96 does have an auto position that uses the accelerometer . It does work ( disabled by default ) but not all Symbian programs support it . Therefore you are left with a rather quirky feature that may not activate when you expect it to.The T9 system is fast and pretty accurate . Honestly it 's not going to get any better than this for input with a numeric keypad . The next step is have some hard alpha keys or an onscreen keyboard.As for phone quality , it sounded pretty good on both ends . Then again , a 3G connection provides the crisp quality so the network infrastructure is more to the reason here.Conclusion : Nokia 's N96 feels like a step back into time . It is sluggish in response , has poor included utilities , and its construction is not as good compared to its main rivals -- The iphone and the various Windows mobile platform phones . The high price is not commensurate with its ability . In particular , web browsing is awful . A complete redesign is needed to make this phone faster and more intuitive .	-1
I return the item because it did not give me all it says will do .	-1
I was excited to try this phone out as I have been using Windows Mobile devices for awhile ( currently using the AT & T ; Tilt ) and never been completely satisfied with their performance . A 16 gig phone geared for music and video looked right up my alley . Having used this phone for several days and tried as many features as possible , I 'm not nearly as enamored with it as I hoped . For a $ 600 phone , I expected something far more polished . This seems to have been rushed into production and has quite a few bugs and problems . Let 's run down the good stuff first.PROS : - Light , compact form factor . Considerably lighter than my Tilt.- 16 gig of memory . Excellent amount of included space , and can take a microSD card for even more media files.- Beautiful screen . Video is sharp and colorful , although it could be a bit brighter . But hard to complain with the quality of the picture . See below though for more comments on video playback . It also is much more visible in sunlight than my Tilt is.- 5 gig camera with flash and video capability . I debated whether to include this under the `` pros '' as I did n't find the quality of the images produced by the camera all that great , particularly indoors . But having a flash and being able to record video with it is still at least better than not having it at all.- Excellent sound quality and nice loud speakers . Includes two speakers for `` sort-of '' stereo playback . This phone can really produce some serious volume , I was quite impressed . Granted , the sound quality out of the speakers is not going to blow anyone away . But it 's pretty good regardless . And make sure you turn the volume down before using the headphones , it will totally blast you away ! If you regularly try to listen to music in noisy situations where volume is crucial , you will know how important this can be.- Excellent multimedia features included . FM radio , internet radio , podcasts , etc . Most of these I could do on my WM phone , but great to have them included for seamless integration right on the phone.- Good included accessories . Includes a remote with speakerphone , car charger , TV out cables , free game , etc . Better package overall than most phones.Now for my fairly long list of negatives.CONS : - Lack of fullsize keyboard and/or touchscreen . I was surprised to see there was no touchscreen on this phone , that makes it really hard to compete with other smartphones in the same class like the iPhone and any Windows Mobile phone . With my Tilt , I not only have a full QWERTY keyboard ( which granted , is not the greatest way to enter text for most people , but nice for things like passwords and WEP keys ) you can use a wide variety of entry methods that work with the touchscreen . I personally use ones like Fitaly and Touchpad which can give good speed and yet still easily handle non-standard text at any time . One of the things I particularly find annoying with phones like this that use T9 is that you often have to turn it on and off which requires going to the menu . Likewise with the multi-key entry of letters and numbers , you have to constantly switch back and forth , which takes far longer on this phone than just about any other smartphone I 've used . It 's incredibly tedious and if you use your phone as a PDA or anything other than quick texting , you should probably look at better options.- Problems using Wifi versus AT & T ; data plans . I personally use pay-as-you-go currently as I do n't need to pay for monthly cell phone service and almost always have access to Wifi networks . With my Tilt , it 's a simple matter of a one-time configuration of the phone for any Wifi network and it will use that automatically versus accessing the AT & T ; data network . This phone just would not cooperate with that . It often would switch over and use the data plan and charge me no matter how I configured it , even going into the settings and making my Wifi the default . Worse , you would have to do this *every* time you access a new Wifi network , setting it up as a default and then switching it back , and even then , it seems to randomly hit the data network and charge me for usage without warning . And to make it even more annoying , just about every time it needs to access the internet , it has to ask me what network to use , the Wifi or AT & T . ; Why bother setting a default ( and configuring it for automatic ) if it 's not going to just use it ? ? It 's almost like the phone is trying to get you to use the paid data plan whether you have access to Wifi or not . Just about everything else on this phone I can kind of deal with , or work around , but this is so frustrating for me and COSTS ME MONEY that it 's a total dealbreaker . So if you want to use Wifi as your primary data access network , and not pay the significant cost of a monthly data plan , you will probably want to use a different phone.- Bare-bones email and web applications . The email and web apps that came with the phone did n't do much for me . Emails with HTML were not properly formatted at all , and the options for handling email as well were very limited compared to what I am used to . When I tried to adjust my settings , it wiped out my custom POP settings and I had to enter them all over again ( which due to the lack of keyboard is particularly annoying ) . The web browser was not quite as bad , but navigating the pages without a touchscreen is slow and tedious and it kept popping up the `` overall '' page view when it was inconvenient . The back button brings up little thumbnails of the pages but for some reason they were often blank and kept skipping the actual page I wanted to get back to . I was easily able to load on the free Opera Mini browser however , which gave me a far better experience . If you use a smartphone , I highly recommend grabbing a copy of it . I 've not yet found a free email replacement , I 'd probably have to pay to get an email application that just does the basics that I would have liked to come with the device.- While there 's certainly plenty of games on Symbian and for N-Gage , the library of applications is a bit more limited . Also just the fact that it does n't use a touchscreen makes game play often more limiting and somewhat more tedious as it relies totally on keystrokes , particularly the types of games I prefer ( card games , adventure games , etc . ) Still , the games offered were decent enough and the graphics top-notch for a mobile phone , and I do notice more places offering Symbian versions of their software . Both my Hava player and Roboform mobile apps had versions that ran okay on the N96 ( although not flawless ) .- Performance issues . My main hope was that this device would be zippier and less prone to locking up than the Tilt . Unfortunately this was not the case . The processor is downgraded from the previous N95 model , most likely done to allow them to also downgrade the battery as well but I ca n't say if the problems I saw are a result of this or typical for Symbian phones . While the video was sharp and beautiful to look at , I still experienced pauses and skips ... particularly with the sample videos included ! Almost all of the ones included with the phone did not play smoothly all the way through . I had better luck with some small videos that I synced to the device and a couple TV episodes that I downloaded from Amazon Unbox . While they did not always play perfectly , they were at least watchable for 95 % of the time . The phone itself also often temporarily pauses and/or freezes and a few times locked up on me completely . Unlike the Tilt which has a reset option , I could not figure out how to unlock this phone when it froze other than to remove the back and pull the battery out . Very annoying.- Camera image quality . It 's important when evaluating cameras to realize that megapixels means little about quality . So getting 5 MP with the phone means mostly that the images it takes will just take up more space on the phone . They certainly are n't of a quality that I would be interested in printing them out which is where the 5 MP would be of any use . They are of similar quality to most cellphones ... which means only good for snapshots when you have nothing better on-hand . And indoors in anything other than very bright light , they were definitely worse than what my Tilt is able to take , even though the camera includes a flash.- Battery life . Barely passable , no better than my Tilt which was equally a battery hog . You definitely need to charge it every night and if you use your phone much , you may find you need to charge it during the day as well.- Voice control . This is one of those phones that you do n't really train , it just recognizes the names you speak and picks the default phone . Also some basic application control . This type of VR can be problematic if you have people with similar names and I just much prefer training my own names and commands as I can with the software on WM phones . And of course , there 's nothing in the manual about how to even use this feature.- Live TV . Touted as a feature , but wo n't work for most people due to very limited coverage right now . You 're probably much better off just getting a Slingbox or Hava which will work with a wide range of phones these days , including this one.- Non-standard USB cable . May seem like a small nit , but things like this just annoy me . Why not use a standard mini-USB cable , which most people have multiple ones of , and also a USB cable that will simultaneous charge the device ? It 's really annoying when you are syncing the device , moving videos , etc . and it runs out of juice . Using this new micro USB cable means I 'll need to buy another one for travel ... .and probably another cable for charging in different places.- GPS . I only tested the GPS briefly as this was another area where it seemed to insist on using the data plan rather than Wifi . But I just do n't see the benefit in using a GPS on such a small screen and paying monthly fees for it , when you can buy dedicated GPS units for as little as $ 100 these days that are larger and easier to read while driving , and with much better features . This GPS did n't work nearly as well as my simple Garmin unit and did n't even compare with running TomTom on my Tilt which I do n't pay any fee to use ( other than the purchase cost of the software ) .- No case or screen protector . For the price , some kind of cheap case would be nice . The device comes with a plastic skin covering the front and back that would do nicely as a screen protector , but for some reason , they plastered a big `` NOKIA '' over the front so it ca n't be used . The screen and phone itself really shows fingerprints and smudges pretty readily so a screen protector would have been highly appreciated.- Nokia PC Suite issues . I did n't have too much trouble syncing my Outlook contacts , but had various issues with other parts of the PC Suite . Forget using the music application , for some reason it did n't read 99 % of the tags in my MP3s , so had to use Media Player to sync music to the device . The video manager as well did not work very well for me . It handled small videos okay , but as soon as it got to anything with length , it locked up on me . Took me several tries to convert videos of more than 100 meg in size . I want to try and do some conversions myself and see what videos it really can handle , as I have other mobile video conversion software that does a good job , but I know already it does n't seem to handle Divx video which is a shame.- Bare bones user manual . The manuals included cover the basics , but you wo n't find much help in them if you need more than just `` getting started '' information . For instance , I was trying to figure out where I turn on T9 predictive text , but there 's absolutely no information in the manual on text entry whatsoever . I went to the Nokia site to see if the support section had a better manual to download , but nope . You better be good at figuring stuff out on your own to use this phone ( and yes , I did figure out where the T9 setting was ) .- Other issues . I seem to just run into random problems with this phone . YouTube videos for instance would not play at all , regardless of which browser I used . It does n't seem to like most of my album art in the music player , and does not always play smoothly if playing in the background while doing other activities on the phone ( web browsing for instance ) . The microSD slot is harder than most to get the card in and out of . The build quality is very plastic , cheap feeling . And there are just some things that make it obvious it was kind of rushed to market . For instance , there 's a settings screen for a `` scroll wheel '' even though the phone does n't even have one ! Would be nice if it did , but to have settings in there for something that does not even exist on it , makes me wonder how much testing they really gave this phone before releasing.To summarize , this is a phone I really wanted to like . It 's got huge potential as a portable media device and phone , but there are just too many problem areas to recommend it over other devices in the same price range .	-1
Shipping : Ordered this case on a Monday from Boxwave . Was not shipped out until Friday . And that 's after I had to email Boxwave customer service on Thursday to see what the hold up was . It was shipped in small white envelope . How long does it take to put it in an envelope and mail it ? Apparently 5 days ! It 's so hard having a Amazon Prime Membership and paying for crappy service when Prime is n't offered.Case : The case is lightweight and does n't add a lot of bulk to the phone . After the first night of use I noticed that the USB cable did n't really fit in the slot . The USB cable will not fit in secure enough to stay . After looking at it closer , looks like the space below the USB slot has plenty of space cut out , but the space above the top just barely clears the slot . So I 'm guessing you have to make sure it 's in there , or it will just fall out.The power button is a little hard to press with the case on . I bought this case as a temporary solution until Otterbox comes out with a case ( in Blue on July 14th ) . Once I get a better case , I will be putting this case in a drawer.Edit : 9-28-13The case has completely fallen apart . The black ring has come apart from the clear back . And it seem as if the clear back did n't protect the phone as much as you would think . There are scratches on the back of the case . And the only times I took it off was to pull the battery or add a memory card .	-1
I 've ordered many cases for the S3 , so I have many to compare with.Pros : - Looks good- Transparent back is nice for a white phone- Side texture adds grippinessCons : - Bad buttons cover . No clicking feedback from the button , and buttons either would not respond or get stuck.If this had a better button design , it would be a keeper .	-1
I like how its clear but weeks later it began to get beige on the white part i didnt care for it	-1
I had a dash mount holder for my Garmin , which I loved , so I thought this would be great for my iPhone . However , I have the Otterbox Defender case on my phone ( which I do love ! ) , and I guess with the case it 's just too heavy . The mount wo n't keep the phone upright enough to see it . Also , I have a Honda CRV , and the dash is slightly curved , so it does n't sit well on it . Might be good for other people , but it did n't work for me .	-1
I had high hopes for this product , as it was reviewed very positively .I tried it out without the phone , and the suction did not stick at all . It lasted about 10 minutes , and then fell right off the mount . I tried several times , under normal weather conditions , and it absolutely does not stay together.I have n't put my phone in it yet , because it is n't secure at all , and am considering using some super double sided tape to rig it together , but should I really have to rig a product like this in the first place.I 'm getting an extended battery for my Evo 4g , which will increase the weight of the phone , and honestly do n't this this mount can handle it.I 've got a few days to think about it before I return it.I ca n't recommend this at all .	-1
I bought this before I bought a battery pack with the initials RS . This offer no protection for the phone . I later purched the battery pack by RS and a Clarifi case and am so mad I spent the $ 100 for this . I would wait for it to go below $ 50 and then it would be worth buying .	-1
looks alright but did n't fit on my grandpas iphone 3G . it fell off when ever he took it out of his pocket .	-1
While the privacy aspect serves the purpose well , this screen cover darkens the screen dramatically . I had to adjust the display for a brighter screen but it does not improve much and also shortens battery life . In addition , it dramatically diminishes the clarity and the screen looks slightly blurred . You can see the diagonal lines running across the screen . I 've had no issues with screen touch sensitivity . I will more than likely go back to my regular screen protector as I miss the sharp , bright screen display.Update : Removed this filter half hour after writing this review ... it 's that bad .	-1
Not a product I would buy again as it left bubbles all over the screen , Lint free cloth was good to clean my eyeglasses	-1
I agree with what others have posted . The protector applies easily and the privacy works well without dimming the screen too much . Unfortunately the protector is so thick that the touchscreen no longer works after the screen is applied .	-1
I liked the idea of a screen protector since I constantly carry my iPhone with me and did n't want it to get scratched . That said , the screen protector became so gross overtime that I HAD to peel it off . What do I mean by gross ? The edges of the sticker seemed to attract makeup , dust and other gunk making the phone look VERY unsanitary . Even when I tried putting my phone in a separate clean pocket , it still picked things up whenever I put it up to my face to talk . If you 're purely using the headphones or a bluetooth device this may be less of an issue for you . However , as someone who wears make up and was constantly picking it up this was a big issue for me . It especially had a tendency to collect around the button and was virtually impossible to clean off.Now that I have removed the protector this is no longer a problem . I find that it does n't seem to attract makeup anymore and even when it does I can easily clean it off with a gentle cloth . I also have n't had any issues with scratches and dents , despite regular use , making the think the screen is durable enough on its own.The bottom line is that I would recommend this if you are putting it up to your cheek to talk and wear makeup because it can get gross pretty fast and is hard to clean .	-1
I did n't expect the quality to be this bad . Out of the three that I got , one has an uneven circle shape for the home button.What 's really bad is that once you 've put the screen protector on , you wo n't get a clear screen protector . You can actually see the SOAP FILM like that on a bubble all over the screen . I waited for a few days , but the soap film are still visible . It 's extremely irritating and unattractive . I would not recommend this item at all ! I	-1
This protects the screen but does n't really look all that great . Oily shimmer to the screen when looking at your reflection can be a little irritating . Also , I tried over and over again but I could n't get this to fit the phone . I got it perfectly centered and every edge of the case was bubbled up because it was overlapping the silver bezel . I hair smaller on each side and it would have been perfect.As it is , the one I got was n't that great and I ca n't recommend this to anybody else based on the one that I got .	-1
The short of it : -The ringer has an inherent flaw in it and if it turns off on its own it will not turn back on without a hard reset . This has happened to my phone and the ringer will only stay on for a couple of hours . Thus , every few hours I have to hard reset my phone if I want to hear it ring . Palm refuses to replace the phone and refuses to create a fix for it as it is a registry issue from what I have read on the Palm Forums.-Once the phone goes on roaming , I practically have to reset it to get it off roaming.-I consistently use the comm manager to turn off and on wireless/cellular due to flying all the time and I often have to go through the motions two or three times to get it to actually execute.-The battery is ok for a smart phone.-The on board internet browser gets the job done for me.-The call quality has been fine and it rarely drops calls on me.-All my messaging capabilities work ok , though I ca n't figure out how to timestamp incoming texts , annoying.I 'd not recommend this phone to others due to my issues with it . If the ringer worked , I 'd probably give it 4 stars , but since it is a phone , and it is supposed to ring , it 's kind of a pain in the neck .	-1
The Palm Treo breaks . Then the replacement ( refurbished unit ) breaks , and then the second replacement unit ( refurbished ) breaks . The overall design is good , but the manufacturing appears to be lacking .	-1
This battery arrived on time and was visually identical to the original OEM battery . However , it quickly lost the ability to retain a charge and requires daily recharging when the original OEM battery lasted 3-5 days when new . It 's no better than the worn out 2-1/2 year old original battery that it replaced .	-1
once charged , this battery lasts about 6 hours without mush usage . First we thought it was great , nice fit , appeared to charge just fine . Maybe I got a lemon , maybe it 's the generic brand . I would buy this one again	-1
I do n't know if I just got a bad set , but all 3 were way off on the cutting . To line up the ear hole , it causes the button hole to be misaligned and on top of that the whole thing was too large . it caused bubbles around the whole rim because it would not fit inside of the rim which is slightly higher than the screen . Horrible QC to say the least .	-1
These just did n't lay as well on the screen as other brands I 've used . There were more bubbles and it curled on some edges , making it hard to fit into my case . If I ever decide to use protective screens again , I 'll spend more money for a better product .	-1
I bought these from wal-mart , and all three screen protectors are bigger than the iPhone 3g screen . They were intentionally made that way so that the screen would peel and wear off fast.They produce a lot of glare compare to other screen savers that I 've used in the past.Scratched easily , finger prints , etc ... The point is that these screen protectors suck ! The best ones that I 've used are the protectors that bought from Fry 's electronics made from Japan . Unfortunately , Fry 's does n't sell those anymore .	-1
JMHO ; They 'll never look as good as the phone 's screen itself ; everyone I know who try to put them on wind up with stuff stuck under the screen protector , creating bubbles that will make your phone 's beautiful screen look like crap . Watch with wonder as your 'gift ' drives them nuts , trying to re-install the product over and over again , winding up in frustration as they can never get it on quite right . After a month , I gave up on screen protectors for my iphone ; a year later , still no scratches ( but then I carry mine in a holster , not my pocket or just tossed in a purse , so YMMV ) and the screen still looks pristine ; I guess that 's why they used glass and not plastic for the screen .	-1
I purchased this bluetooth and it would not charge . I emailed the company and they re sent me another one and it wouldnt charge either . i purchased the same blue tooth from another online company and it would not work either , so now i am having to go through motorolla .	-1
Though when this headset works it is fine audio and comfortable to wear , I do not recommend it because it does not hold a charge for very long . Previous headsets that I have owned have lasted at least a week with only one hour a day use on average . This one requires charging every other day .	-1
I got this to replace my Plantronics Voyager 510 . I found the Plantronics over-the-ear piece to be too bulky , always pushing the top of my ear far away from my head . Also , I found the Plantronics to be uncomfortable for long periods of time . However , the boom mic was superior . It picked up the voice very easily and clearly at the other end . The Motorola does not pick up my voice unless I hold it firmly against the side of my face , pointing to the mouth . [ The boom tends to swing away from the face . ] I tried all of the ear fittings hoping I would find one that more securely held it in place , to no avail . It is more comfortable for me to wear , but inferior regarding its functionality .	-1
Fitment is near impossible and the thing will not stay on my head . Sound quality is average at best . Plus , it completely plugs your ear so you hear nothing out of that ear . Really sorry I bought this , and getting something else .	-1
2 good things about the Jabra SP700 : Price and the speaker works well for the user.The bad : It cuts out on the person on the other end delivering jerky speech and partial words .	-1
I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my brother in law - it arrived on time , but in a clear plastic bag . No box . Considering the cost , i was surprised , and now may return it . Without the box it makes me think it feel off a truck , and i do n't know how i 'm supposed to gift it as planned.UPDATE : difficulties with the shipper , he offered to send a box and did , but it was not a gift box , and i had to go out and find another . irritating , but the real problem came out when my brother in law tried to use it . it never worked ! he even took it to the apple store to try to get them to help , no good . i sent it back and requested a refund , AND NEVER GOT THE REFUND . i complained to Amazon who gave me a store credit , and apologized , but i never heard back from the seller !	-1
The materials and design of this product are far inferior to the Cliphanger , which comes without the light Cliphanger stick and adhesive pad CLEAR orCliphanger-Universal Caddy for Handheld Devices , Colors May Varyor with an LED , which is available at the Cliphanger site . Do n't be fooled into thinking that these are identical . The `` Deluxe '' SmartClip 's light is difficult to use and very dim . The adhesive is faulty . I dropped my phone 3 times the first day ( and I still had the SmartClip in my hand ) . Avoid .	-1
I got this a couple of months ago . One thing I did notice was that if you do n't use the screen protector that comes with the case . there is a good chance that the case itself will push up against the bottom of your protector . This will cause a bubble that ca n't be pressed down since the case is in the way.A few weeks ago the thin piece of plastic at the very bottom cracked . Just today I found out that there was another crack on the circle part of the case on the back that holds the 2 pieces together . I just found it ridiculous that this case got such good reviews initially , so I decided to write this to help even things out . It 's good at first glance even in person , but after a few short months you 'll probably end up needing another case .	-1
Get what you pay for with this case . Its hard to put on , hard to take off , hard to keep on . Do n't waste your money here . Buy a neopreen Otterbox or an & # 34 ; in case & # 34 ; that is similarly designed but better built .	-1
Upon first receiving the case , I realized the bottom half would not fit snug into the top . However , since the slight gap was not a big deal , I proceeded to use it as my primary case . Unfortunately , have less than a month of use , the case has broken and cracked in numerous places after just regular use ( I did not , obviously , throw my phone or drop it several times on the ground ) . The color is fading and chipped in certain areas . This case is absolutely horrible . I do no recommend this to anyone . Even the low price is n't worth it .	-1
My husband loved this at first ; however , his love was short lived . The case started not closing properly , so his phone would fall out . This is a big concern since you ca n't fit a case on the phone when in this . He ended up switching to an Otterbox which provided the protection and convenience .	-1
I would return it , except it would cost that much just to return it.The thing charges . I 'll give it that.But* when charging , it causes the iPhone to emit a very noticeable high-pitched sound during play . * the cord is laughably short . * the craftsmanship is , well , I guess what you should expect for a few bucks . I had to push and wiggle it into my ( Dodge Ram 1500 ) lighter outlet to get the proper connection . I took it out and in my bag for a day or two , and it fell apart ( the tip fell off ) .I bought this as an alternative to the $ 30 AT & T ; one , but I guess I 'll have to cough that up to get something with a little quality.I think this product should not be on the market , even granting the caveat `` you get what you pay for . '' It represents itself as an alternative to the brand one ; it is n't .	-1
I guess you get what you pay for . This thing worked initially , but it gradually started to smell like a small electrical fire . After 6 months of occasional use , the thing burned out entirely.For S & Gs ; I took the thing apart . It 's not horribly made , but it does have a design flaw that is practically guaranteed to cause electrical failure . The failure wo n't burn up your car or burn out your iPhone , but it will stop working .	-1
I bought three of these things about a year ago . I gave one to my girlfriend , one to my brother , and I kept the other one for myself.At first they worked great . But within less then a year , each of them failed . None of them work now.In short , these things must have some kind of design flaw , resulting in a failure after a few months . Do n't waste your money . There are many other similar products on the market for a similar price .	-1
I bought this with the hope i can finally charge it on the go in my car ... ..but to my dismay the plug is to fat to fit through the case opening . I went with a USB cable instead . If you have an Otterbox , do n't waste your money on this .	-1
This product worked great for a couple weeks but after I while I noticed the phone was no longer charging . The red light still comes on , but the phone does not receive a charge . Tested it in another vehicle with same results . Not sure if recent iPhone updates had anything to do with it or if it just died . Looks like I 'll have to spend the extra $ for a name brand charger .	-1
This is a very cheap product in cost and quality . Poor design and very cheap plastic . I bought 2 and only 1 of them works .	-1
Amazon shall remove this product or vendor from their list.The connector does not fit the 3G or 3GS IPhone , pure trash.I should have requested my money back , too much waste of timeand energy . Shame on you Amazon for not having a better quality controlover the products that you list or the vendors you do business with.If you want to waste your time and money buy this product.Thanks	-1

By pass this thing and get an iPhone ! Freezes frequently and requires a reset.Little ball thingy you use to navigate is a joke.Small screen.Fails to connect to WiFi hotspots too many times.Teeny tiny keys.Update software from RIM is a farce . No Shortcuts anywhere after install . No way to find the program executable as there are no Entries anywhere to get to it . No where . Once you trick it right after install or re-install or re-re-install , the update process stalls several times and then times out and you are stuck.FORGET IT . LIFE IS TOO SHORT.GET YOURSELF AN iPHONE ! ! !	-1
I bought this as a replacement for a Plantronics Voyager 520 . ( Lost it , so needed a quick replacement . ) I found the 520 to be very comfortable . The way it channeled sound into the ear worked very well.Pros : * Has a mute function . I listen in on lots of telecons for business , so I really needed this . * Sound quality is very good , both for both ends ( if you can keep it in your ear ) * Buttons are easy to access and operate.Cons : * I have not been able to find any way to make this fit me . With the tips that is came with , it managed to be both painful , and yet fall out easily . any turn of the head and it would be hanging there in space . I also had a hard time hearing it because it would end up too far out of my ear . I could use the oblong tip and get it wedged to where it would stay better , but it hurt terribly . I tried a 3rd party ear gel , and that holds it a bit better , but still hurts . I end up having to push it back in every couple minutes , especially if I 'm moving around at all . And for the record , I 've never had any problems with stereo earbuds or ear-canal phones . * Related to fit , when trying to stuff it back in your ear , it is really easy to accidentall hit the big call control button and cut off the call.I really ca n't imagine how anyone can use this for any time at all . I 've made it work for several weeks , but I 'm looking for a replacement .	-1
it has a good design . but dont fit well the iphone.was a mistake . but i already get another `` otter '' this really fit .	-1
The product did not work as promised ... it did not fit my iPhone 3G , so had to return it back . Amazon was prompt in returning the refund..	-1
I had high hopes for this product because this was recommended by the dealer as the best protection for my iphone . Within the first few weeks , my iphone popped out of my holder at least 4 times and caused it to drop onto concrete floor . Fortunately , the inner shell was hard so my iphone did not break . Do n't buy this product if you want to wear it on your belt because the clip on does not work !	-1
I am very dissapointed with this product ... ..The day i received it i thought this thing looks great and with the built in screen protector to it makes it even better , for little over $ 12.00 i paid i thought this is a steal . Well fast forward over a week later , the outer layer of the black silicon skin starts to rub off , make it look like some dirt that needs to be wiped off . Worse , this thing is a lint magnet , it 's like I 'm holding a furry kitten against my ear every time i use my iphone ... ..As the saying goes , you get what you pay for ... ... ... .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , this is a good case , but not any better than a couple others on Amazon for half the cost with free shipping if you are a Prime Member . I contacted Otterbox Customer Service and they were very unresponsive and abrupt . I have three cases ( two iPhones ) and I would rate this behind a popular one on Amazon.The case offer good protection , but the screen protector makes it difficult to view the phones apps in bright light . Also the snap on holster does not hold the phone if you are wearing a jacket . The clip style holster barely hold the phone in place and the jacket rubbing against the phone is enough for the phone to fall to the ground . You need to be careful because if you are on grass , snow or in a loud area you will not hear the phone fall .	-1
Bought this for my iPhone 3GS for use on the golf course.I 've had a couple of drops , but it protected my iPhone without any problems . What I did n't notice at the time was that a couple of grains of sand got into the case . The phone moves just enough inside the case for the sand to get inside and scratch up the back side of my iPhone.This leads me to my next issue . The rubber outer cover is too tacky . I believe the sand problem was caused by the tacky rubber not releasing all the sand when I tried brushing it off . If you keep this phone in your pocket , it will pickup every lint and crud from your pocket.Finally , The plastic film that protects LCD causes an oil slick effect . There various ways to prevent this from happening ( search Google ) , but Otterbox could have used a different material to prevent this happening in the first place.Good case for protection against major drops & hits . Not too good against sand ...	-1
I purchased my case in April 2009 and was very excited to receive it . It installed fairy easily and I had installed an Apple screen protector directly on the phone before installing the case to cure the oily film problem . That fix works great and gives you an additional layer of protection . The problem I had with the case was the echo . Callers started to complain that they heard themselves talking back in their phone . I dismissed it the first couple times I was told about the echo . Blamed it on the wonderful AT & T service . However the complaints kept coming in and it got to the point callers were hanging up on me . I Googled iPhone echo and returned some results about dust & dirt in the microphone and even called Apple & AT & T , neither were helpful . I never suspected the case until I removed the case and swapped out a thinner leather case while on a trip . Much to my surprise , no more complaints . As a test , I had a friend call me from 50 feet away , once with no case & no echo , then with the OtterBox and sure enough an echo . Now the case sits in my desk drawer .	-1
I bought the Defender and dumped it . Everything I liked about the iPhone was gone once it went inside the Defender . The `` oil slick effect '' on the screen protector was an absolute disaster . The iPhone 's screen sensitivity was severely reduced by this case and you ca n't easily get to the keyboard characters near the edges because of the Defender 's bulky construction . You may be able to run over it without destroying your iPhone but you 'll never get used to the shortcomings this case presents you with . Take my advice : BUY the COMMUTER case instead !	-1
Sennheiser used to be reputable ; now I must agree with those who say these earbuds are junk . The shorter earbud worked intermittently at first ( plugging and unplugging sometimes cleared the problem ) and I like the asymmetric form so much that I kept hoping they would 'break in ' . Instead , they just broke , with the shorter earbud not working at all . Too bad , back to the kludge-but-robust Sure adapter with old Sony earbuds .	-1
First things first , make sure you are ordering the right headset . These fit a 3.5 mm jack , NOT the old 2.5 mm that you would find in most other/older phones . Easy way to test if you 're not sure , take an iPod headset ( or any headset you use for a mp3 or CD player ) , and see if it fits . If it does , than you are looking at the right headset.Before getting into too much detail let me first give a concise Pro/Con summation : Pro : Best earbuds on any headphones I 've ever used.Con : The microphone is as equally bad as the earbuds are good.Despite being slightly shocked by just how good the earbuds were , these are of no use to me if the microphone is unusable.The Sennheiser MM50 iP Earbuds / Headset have the most outstanding sound I 've ever hear from a headset , but an incredibly BAD microphone . Also , the Sennheisers were engineered to keep the microphone close to your mouth by placing it at the Y of the headphone split , and making on line short enough to pull the mic close to your mouth . This is an awful design that should never be repeated . I found myself constantly having to repeat myself when talking on this headset.I can say though , that with the Sennheiser Earbuds , I could hear details in my music that I never heard before . A simply amazing sound , with outstanding isolation capabilities . In a very noisy gym , I could keep my iPhone at a low volume and still hear great detail to my music.In comparison , the Ultimate Ears MetroFi headset keeps the normal , symmetrical Y shape to the earbuds , and places the microphone on one of the lines , close to your mouth . Having my wife call me on her Chocolate 3 phone , I was at first disappointed . `` Did you forget to bring the headset with you ? '' I asked . Nope , she had them on.Over the years , between the two of us , we 've probably used about a dozen different headsets between the two of us , and the MetroFi set was the clear winner when it came to microphone quality . Funny thing is , to look at them , you would n't think it.For earbud quality test , I compared them to my Sony , J2 , Metrofi 170vi , and iPod earbuds ( all noise isolating except the iPod ) . Sound quality places the MetroFi 170vi down by the iPod headset , and sadly , they were probably equal to the iPod headset for noise isolation as well . The Sony and J2 earbuds were roughly equal in both categories , far behind the Sennheiser , and slightly less far ahead of the MetroFi 170vi and iPod set.Comfort wise , I would rate the four as follows : Sennheiser ( again , by far ) , MetroFi 170vi , Sony , then J2 ( So bad , they caused one of my ears to be sore for days ) Durability could probably be a little better , but they have n't failed me yet . So far , just one of the 1 1/2 inch sleaves , attached to the earbuds has come off.I would recommend the Metrofi 170vi set over these . IMHO , when wearing headphones that are also a headset , microphone quality trumps headset quality.edit 11/28/2010I earbud died shortly after this review . It kills me , 'cause for comfort and sound quality , nothing beats these ... nothing even comes close to these . Unfortunately , a crappy mic , and poor durability make this a lousy product .	-1
These sound a lot better than the Apple In-Ear earphones with remote and mic . They have more bass and sound pretty good for the price . They work with the iPhone as they have a mic and button but no volume controls unfortunately.That 's where the praise ends though . The mic housing is a bit heavier than I would like and I do n't like how the right cable is made to go behind your neck . Also , no case is included . Also talking on the phone with these is not comfortable at all because of the seal they make in your ears , you ca n't hear yourself talk ! You therefor have to pull out the earbuds a bit when talking on the phone.While these do sound pretty good for music , I regret my purchase and wish I had just bought some better audiophile earbuds without the mic instead .	-1
I just received my BoxWave TinyMount . I can tell from the build that this mount is much better than the ones I 've tried from Fry 's or BestBuy . So the first thing I noticed is that the suction cup seems super flat , there is a lock mount that you twist when you place the mount on a flat surface ( like the windshield or on the included flat coaster adapter ) . I did not have a need to use the coaster as I already have a flat surface to use the TinyMount , at first it did not seem like it would stick , but I simply added a few drops of water to the suction cup , and attempted to attach the mount and it has been solid . I drive a truck , and even on bumpy roads this unit holds without issue . I like how easy it is to mount my iPhone and how well it holds a grip.if anything changes I will come back to update my review , but at the moment it 's fantastic , and exactly what I was looking for . This mount is so easy to adjust angles so it faces you easily.EDIT -- 1/29/14So the mount broke in almost 1 month from owning it . I contacted the seller via amazon and they sent me a label to mail them back the broken mount and they refunded me my money.How did it break ? It was a very hot weekend , on Monday I got into the car and I went to try and pull the arms apart to fit my phone and the tiny neck leading to the base broke with almost no effort . I did get my Money back , and maybe this mount requires you to remove it from your car on a hot day. -- Since then I bought new car mount from a local chain store , from manufacturer : ADURO , ( u-touch ) renamed to u-grip now . but what I like is that I 've owned the new mount for over a month and it 's been really positive . it is not compact like the boxwave , but it has a feature : side buttons that effortlessly expand the arms that hold your phone so you can remove it quickly and easily . you can drop your phone into place there is a button that holds your phone into place nicely . I think if boxwave adds something like this I may buy another product , especially since they were so nice to refund my money when I had a product that did not survive .	-1
Feels like cheaper plastic , and I feel hard to insert iPhone 5 . Had to use both hands every time . Expected much better quality . Wo n't recommend .	-1

I bought three and will need them . They fall apart . The part that goes into the touch falls apart into four pieces and is apparently impossible to get it back together so it charges . I have one that is still together . I will super glue it along the seams so it will last until I order some good chargers .	-1
Product worked great for the first couple months , since then the uplink audio on mine has deteriorated to the point that people can not understand me very well , even in quiet environments . My friend also purchased one and is saying his downlink audio will deteriorate while on a call as well as the uplink audio . I believe the uplink audio issue is due to the noise canceling failing because people have a hard time hearing me while driving where they did n't previously.Even in the first few months when the product was at its best while in a quiet environment , I have to cup my hand to channel my voice to the microphone when giving information such as spelling my name or giving numbers for account numbers . The audio does n't seem to be very crisp . Sometimes I just disconnect the bluetooth and use the handset to give these details to which I am told `` That sounds much better '' which is n't what I want to hear after spending $ 70 on a BT headset.I would n't recommend this headset after several months of use as it appears the headset degrades in performance . This is n't just my experience , my friend who bought one at the same time is experiencing the same issues .	-1
I have used and own several BT head sets..Motorolas , Jabras , and Plantronics . My weapon of choice is the Plantronic 510.Large , and hearing-aid ish looking but gave great performance until the dog got ahold of it.Introduce the Jabra Extreme.Packaging- very pleasing to the eyes.. it was impressive looking and made me excited to open it.First glance - SMALL.. im talking small enough where i was concerned i might loose it ( which is a pro and a con I guess ) Headset - small in size , and that equated to small buttons ( hard for me to use with bigger hands at 6'2 and 225..i DID like the feature of a dedicated slider -on/off switch . i didnt have to sit and wait to hold a button to power it on . the tiny little volume buttons made it hard to find and hard to push when it was on my ear..accessories - only a few atachments offered . It has a HARD and i mean hard rubber ear piece ... and THATS IT . no soft gel or cushion option replacement earpiece.there is this tiny , paperclip thin HARD plastic piece that slips over your ear to hold it in place and it felt like it was stabbing me behind my ear.the power accessories were nice . i was VERY impressed it came with a USB adaptor plug that could charge in a PC at my work , or fit into the car charger it came with . VERY NICE ! ! fit - uncomfortable at best . while the weight itself was very nice and often i forgot i was wearing it , it just didnt fit my ears . and im no dumbo by any means..performance - not so great . sounded muffled when i would call a land line and a cell phone wasnt much better . i have Verizon Wireless in the Washington D.C. metro area ( 30 min north ) so VZW has full service just about all over . it was the headset . if , in the middle of a call id switch to my plantronics 510 , the problem would resolve itself.despite the nice car charger/usb adaptor , and nice look/color of it it just falls short due to the horrible fit/feel of making my ear just hurt after wearing it , and the horrible performance during calls .	-1
After an extensive search for the best headset for my husband to use in noisy conditions ( delivery truck ) , we finally found the Jawbone Prime , which is perfect for him.My situation is more typical , I just needed something that would sound decent with regular car background noise for the occasional on-the-road phone call.Not willing to spend another $ 100+ for the Jawbone , I was happy to see this tiny Jabra Extreme.After spending a few weeks with it these are my conclusions : Good : + Ultra-compact design : fits anywhere.+ Includes car charger : Most require you to purchase this separately . Charger style is also nice and small.+ Real on/off switch : No wondering and waiting to see the light to be sure the unit is powered down.+ Pairs quickly and easily with my Motorola W385 and works with the phone 's voice recognition.+ Fits my ear comfortably . I have small ears , and the smaller in-ear loop is so comfortable , I forget I 'm wearing it.+ Sound quality on my end is good , and loud enough in the car even at 1/2 volume.Bad : - Microphone requires very loud speaking voice for the other party to hear you.- Tinny , annoying-sounding voice quality your poor callers have to deal with.- Did n't fit my husband 's ear , no matter what configuration he tried. -- -- -- -- -- In the end , no matter how nice the features are on a bluetooth headset , it all comes down to what it sounds like - to you and the person you 're calling - and this headset fails at both .	-1
No body could hear me or understand what I was saying . That is using the Jabra in my office at home with no background noise . It went right back to Amazon . Save for time and money . I like the Plantronics Margue 2 . Crystal clear on both ends	-1

I loved this dock for the Bold , at first . Worked great . Very handy way to charge without plugging and unplugging . Moreover , a handy feature ( controlled by options you can choose on the phone settings ) can automatically shift the Bold to clock mode when it is charging . So you drop it in the dock , and it become your night clock . Great.My problem is simple : after a couple of months , it stopped working reliably . I put it in the dock , but the phone does not charge . Or , it does charge , but then twenty minutes later it stops . Easy to tell , because if it is not charging , it also does not shift into clock mode . So it sits in the pod , not charging . And because it is n't in clock mode it will ring if someone calls , not what you probably want in the middle of the night ( especially if you are traveling and your caller does not realize the time zone you are in ) . Somehow or another , the phone stopped connecting reliably to the dock.I am still using it , but instead of leaving the charger connected to the docking station , I plug and unplug the charger 's cord from the phone itself each time , and use the docking station as just a stand . Still kind of works , but not the way it is supposed to and not so handy . A disappointment.Perhaps I just got a bad one , as I do n't notice this complaint from others.UPDATE : The problem was the phone not the charging pod . I replaced the phone on warranty on another issue , and discovered that the new phone charged just fine in this pod . I would now rate the pod five stars .	-1
Well , it 's consistent.The stock cable that came with my BlackBerry is a micro-USB on the BB end . The base needs a mini-USB connection . So that did n't fit.But then , my BBBold did n't fit either ; it was n't at all secure , and it looked like the charging nibs would have had a dead short through the metallic band around the rim of the case ... so perhaps it 's just as well I did n't have a cable.Anyway , it 's going back immediately .	-1
The description was incorrect and the product did not match my device .	-1
I thought this was for the 9900 . I ordered the wrong product . This was my error , not the error of the company or product ...	-1
Storm comes with a screen protector already . Unless you want to replace the orginal bubble-free protector with your own , there is no need to buy this .	-1
This battery looks just like the photo and says it is a RIM Blackberry , but it will not hold a charge . Fully charged , it does not even last eight hours . This battery was made in China , the ones that seem to work better are made in Japan . The battery I am replacing was made in Japan and after years of use , it is actually still better than this new made in China battery . It 's not worth any amount of money - do n't buy it .	-1
bad battery is ded when it reached mei again i should call and get one morei recomand dont buy BlackBerry Standard Battery 9000 Bold	-1
Great idea , but very low quailty . Lasted about three months and the clip that holds the phone in place broke , rendering it useless .	-1
The spring clip broke after 40 days of use . Ca n't even return it since it 's 10 days past the 30 day Amazon return policy . Yes , Seido will ship a replacement for free . But this does n't address the design flaw - the spring clip attachment is so brittle that it will break again after a few weeks . I 've been using holsters like these since 2000 - from the original Palm Treo , to the Blackberry , to the iPhone . This is the first holster I 've used where the the design itself is flawed . Save your $ 30 and get another one .	-1
They put all their effort into creating a phone ( without a mouthpiece ) and added a really cheap headset onto it . If you want a lot of dialing features to carry around the house with you ( caller ID , auto dialing , etc ) then the phone part of this is okay ( my portable phones all do these things , and are only a bit heavier ) . But I wanted really good sound , and this does n't have it . It has one of those mikes that does n't make it all the way to your mouth , and the `` volume control '' is in the phone with only 3 levels - not enough to help.I followed another reviewer 's idea and called into my voicemail from this phone , and from several others in the same call . Then I listened on different phones . This one is slightly better than the $ 20 headset I was trying to replace , but worlds worse than just talking into a regular phone . Not worth $ 100 !	-1
I got a CT12 ( unless it was a CT10 ) back in 2000 . I loved it : it saved my neck from the pain associated with tilting my neck to hold a phone between my shoulder and my ear . The sound quality was great . The phone worked whether docked in its charger or while roaming the house . The sound quality was exceptional . the only problem I ever had with it was that I dropped it all the time and finally , after years of abuse , I killed it . ( In fact , I had two of these phones between 2000 and 2010 , when I finally decided I could n't squeeze anymore life out of the second one , also a victim of falls . ) Compared to the older models , this CT14 is a terrible disappointment . I 'm using it in the same location , yet now there is a constant irritating sound in the background . And it can not be used while docked in the charger . May not sound like a big issue . But to answer these phones , one has to get the headset on , then press the talk button before the call goes to voicemail . With the old model , those were the only steps . With the CT14 , there is a 3rd step -- pull the phone out of the charger , get the headset on , then press talk . It 's not so easy to do that quickly , especially when the headset plug can pull out of the phone quite easily . Also , if you 're using the phone and inadvertently put it back in the charger because you 're using it while sitting at the desk where the charger is , the phone disconnects the call . If it does this because of some danger of the phone blowing up or giving me cancer while in use and in the charger , I 'd be interested to know . Otherwise , it just seems like a design flaw . My rating of this phone is particularly low because I loved the older model so much . It was a revalation . This one is terrible by comparison . ( If you never had the older version , this one might not frustrate you as much as it does me . But really , I am not okay with the terrible sound quality . )	-1
There is a low-grade static buzz sound that one hear almost always . This is not audible to others but significantly diminshes the usability of this product . This item is also corded , another significant hamstring . 1 star - unusable , unsatisfactory quality , and poor technology .	-1
I use this in my home office and it 's done the job so far . A little staticky in places but I have n't isolated if that is the phone , Vonage , or the conference service I use.Setup was straight forward and setting the time and date are easy . I have n't used to many other options on the phone except mute and conference and both are easy enough . The headset is flimsy and cheap feeling especially if your used to Plantronics quality , but it does it 's job and the sound quality is good.Overall a nice travel phone that stays out of the way.Update - June 23rd - More than one year later , it 's breaking.Close to one year later . I reduced this to one star because after daily typical office only use the headphone is starting to crackle and drop audio . It seems the connection into the carry on base unit is somehow dropping the connection which makes this essentially useless . This carries a one year warranty so this is just past the point of help . It was very rare for me to actually take the headphone out of the base which could have caused some connection issues , so I 'm not certain how it lost it 's audio .	-1
Its an ok case but without any belt loops the whole case slides off your belt when trying to remove the phone from the case.If it had a way to stay on your belt I would rate it 4 stars before seeing how long it would last.I 've had some no name brand cases last days and some last years ... I gave this away to a friend who had a thinner phone - hopefully it lasts him a long time .	-1
[ Update ] After giving it great reviews , i 'm gon na have to retract my earlier comments ( see below ) . I have never dropped or abused the case , but now i have three cracks ( two of which have cut all the way through , making the plastic come apart ) at the top of the case , one near the headphone jack , and one near the on/off button . I really liked the case , but i guess it 's not built to last . My best guess as to how it happened is that over time , when you take the phone out of your pocket or something similar , the plastic catches , and it stresses the case . Once you get a crack ( i had the crack near the on/off button first ) it 's just a matter of time before you get another one as the crack will open the case up to getting `` caught '' on something more often . It 's not possible to fix with adhesives ( i tried ) ; it may appear to be holding , but because the case is so tight when you put it on the phone , the fixed crack will open up again during the process.It 's really too bad ... i was really hoping it would last longer. -- -If you 're looking for a case that will protect against scratches from everyday use ( putting the phone on the table , for example ) this is the case to get . It 's light , sturdy and has got a nice feel , with minimalist design so it 's not changing the look of the phone . If you 're a total clutz and need a case that will protect against multiple drops , and you 're the type who does n't know whether the phone is up or facing down when you set it down on hard surfaces , this is not the case for you . In fact , any case that can take that kind of abuse will not look nice on ANY phone , so you should curb your expectations in that regard.As with ANY case , you 're gon na get discoloration and wear over time , so to minimize this effect i would suggest getting darker color cases - and stay away from any shiny or clear finishes . I got the flat black colored case and scratches are not noticeable and i can use my phone without having to worry about whether i 'm gon na scratch the case badly or not . After all , they 're meant to take the scratches so i do n't understand people that complain about why protective cases get scratched up.Anyways , product is solid . It also comes with a protective film - i would recommend watching instructional videos on youtube on how to apply them as you only get one try with this package ( i messed up and had to get another , poorer film product ) . The protective film seemed to be of good quality also .	-1
I liked the idea of a light case for my iPhone but unfortunately , this case not only broke but the outer pair coating began to chip within days of purchase . I guess I 'll deal with bulkier cases !	-1
If this phone worked as it should it would be acceptable at best , but a number of software problems make it something you will probably want to avoid.The email feature is very good , although it only checks for email from most ISP servers every 15 minutes , and there is no way to force it check for new mail at your convenience . To get around this you must have all your email forwarded to a service like Hotmail or Yahoo , which means you will get copies of your email immediately . However , if you want to reply , you will not be able to change your reply-from account from Hotmail to your main ISP email provider . You 'll have to wait 15 minutes until the original email comes through.When you are in a call , the screen goes dark quickly , and it requires a lot of maneuvering to get a keyboard up if you have to press keys during your call or even if you want to switch to speaker phone mode.Trying to type an email or text takes real perseverance . The default `` Sure Type '' mode that suggests words is cumbersome , and changing its suggestions can be maddening . Even in landscape mode with a QWERTY keyboard , an auto-correct feature takes over and requires constant vigilance . And just TRY to use the touch-and-click screen to reposition the insertion point and make a correction several letters or words back ; it 's really frustrating.The manual that comes with the phone and the various online tutorials do n't begin to cover what you need to know to use the phone 's features ; you will need to attend a Verizon workshop.All of the above assumes that phone actually works as it 's supposed to . After spending hours with Verizon and BlackBerry support staff , I finally got the phone to the point where it works much of the time , which is a giant step up from the way the phone came out of the box.Here are some of the problems , all of which BlackBerry acknowledges as `` known issues '' and which Verizon will tell you SHOULD be addressed in a long-promised and long-overdue software upgrade ( think Windows Vista ) : * Voice-command dialing ( e.g. , via Bluetooth headset ) sometimes results in a white screen that locks up your phone and requires one or more reboots ( a reboot means removing the battery for 15 seconds , replacing it , and waiting 4 to 6 minutes until you can use the phone again ) . * The battery drains quickly and sometimes continues to drain when plugged into a charger ; it may require one or more reboots to start charging . * Synching the Storm with Outlook can result in errors that prevent this feature from working until you spend many hours with support staff trying to find which record causes the problem ; the fix will last a couple of days , before the problem recurs . * The network connection turns itself off occasionally , and you wo n't be able to make or receive calls until you notice that the network is off and you go into the options to turn it back on.In order to get around the Bluetooth lock-ups , I purchased aBlackBerry HS-655+ Bluetooth Headset , which the manual recommends . It has cut down on , but not eliminated , the number of lock-ups.The most helpful support person was a Verizon tech who had me `` wipe '' the phone and start over ( choose the `` Options '' button , then `` Security Options , '' then `` General Settings , '' then press the menu button and choose `` Wipe Handheld '' ; all the software reloads automatically , but you will have to reload any personal data ) . That helped with most of the problems , including the Outlook synch problem , which has n't recurred ( it 's been 10 days ) .	-1
I wanted to love this phone but having a screen that clicks just was not a good design . The mere fact that you have to press , then let go to register a click makes it inherently slow . Plus you cant type without making a lot of racket , like during a business meeting or at the movies . Maybe RIM should give you the option to turn clicking off so u can use it like any old touch screen.The device actually has gaps between the screen and the rest of the body , allowing dust and dirt to get into your phone ! On some on the shipped storms , clicks were not registering on the outer edges of the screen , necessitating uses to stuff paper , etc . in the battery compartment to make the storm work correctly . Are u friggin kidding me ? lolThe worse part of typing is actually the keyboard software itself . Try typing any combination of numbers and letters and you are in for an experience . Too many button presses are required to alternate between numbers and letters . Touch screen keyboards have been around for ever . You 'd think RIM would give you something new that works well . The storm landscape keyboard is n't as good as my old win mobile on screen keyboard from years ago.If you are use to bb 's with a trackball , you are going to find navigating the storm a pain . Try scrolling any long page . It takes forever . Maybe they will put a trackball on the next storm , or at least give u accelerated flicking like u see in the iphone.I wont even mention the slow camera , check error , random reboots , slow accelerometer , bad browser , etc since those things may get fixed if they have n't been already . Just dont expect to be able to run lots of apps like you see on the iphone . It 's simply not going to happen.I 'll be using the bb curve until verizon release the bb storm or the palm pre .	-1
There are good and bad things about the Blackberry Storm . If you 're reading this , chances are you 've already researched this phone a bit and you 've probably read other reviews . Obvious comparisons are abound about the Storm vs. the iPhone . The Storm is a well built phone , but the interface just does n't compare.Pros : Organizing your life with the Storm is easy . The calender , alarm , notes , and navigation are a little tough to learn at first , but are easily mastered . If you have used a Blackberry before , you 'll have no trouble picking this up and going on your way . Hey , this is the main feature of a Blackberry ... right ? The build of the phone is nice and sturdy . You do n't have to worry about breaking this when you throw it in your pocket.Micro USB standard charger - this means a lot of your electronics will use the same charger.The internet is fast , if you can deal with the touch screen.Jim Halpert is featured on the commercials ! Big tuna.Cons : I 've used the iPhone and the LG Dare , so I know touch screen phones . The Storm is a nightmare to text on.The touch screen clicking takes a bit to get used to . I did n't like it , although I 'm sure some will . When I highlight an application , I expect it to open ... I do n't expect to have to highlight something , THEN click it again.No built in internal memory - you 'll need to pick up a micro SD card if you want to put videos or music on there.The screen is n't as impressive looking as either it 's touch screen counterpart the iPhone or it 's AT & T ; brother , the Bold.The bottom line is - if you can get used to the touch screen , this will be a fine phone for you . I did n't like the touch screen , so most of the features did n't do what I needed them to . This phone is just too young - wait for the next version .	-1
I got this phone thinking it would be a lot better than it was . It is so annoyingly slow . It has lots of bugs and drives me crazy . Nearly every day I want to beat it with my hammer . I would rather have one of those old brick phones than this piece of junk . Do n't waste your money ! ! !	-1
I anxiously awaited this phone for a couple months , the day finally came and the phone arrived and what a disappointment it was ! I spent about a week trying to `` get used '' to the feel of the phone , i really gave it every effort but the phone just did n't work the way it should have . I know there have been software releases to make the phone work the way it was intended but I just did n't have the time to invest in it.I 'll make this short and to the point , if you 're a business/power email user then this phone will cramp your style , try it out for a week or two and you will see . Numerous times buttons on the screen were accidentally touched and the camera would come on and different things would activate.The screen rotation system was horrible with a 3-5 second delay from landscape to portrait mode not to mention the phone is just awfully slow.And keep in mind , this was n't just my phone , i ordered over 5 of these and everyone complained about the same thing , all were sent back . Even now , a few weeks after the release people that have them still seem disappointed but are `` stuck '' with them.This would make a great phone for your teenager still in school , but if you use a BlackBerry to make deals happen and to manage your day then this phone is a sad disappointment ! !	-1
I am going to keep this short since I 'm about to go to the Verizon store to replace the `` Storm '' ( aptly named ) with a Curve . This phone is a disaster . Very buggy , which while the bugs can be fixed with upgrades , will never fix the really ( for me , at least ) difficult to use touchscreen keyboard . The problem is that it is nearly impossible not to touch a nearby key on the keyboard and that slows one down considerably . I 've tried , I really wanted this phone to be great given all the features , but ca n't stand it . Also , if you want to use the keyboard , you have to go to menu , scroll down ( should be a top menu choice ) and then select `` Show keyboard . '' That 's an annoyance after being used to having a keyboard ( a real one ) right on the device . When entering information into a field on a webpage , the keyboard does automatically come up . But you have to tap exactly into the field data entry box on the page ( good luck in doing that ; you can magnify the page but then have to demagnify the page to view it after entering your text ) . Just too user unfriendly and an enormous missed opportunity by RIM to create something great .	-1
Nice case but it is built way too tight to fit smartphone with a sturdy rubberized protective shells , only accepts phone with extremely thin cosmetic only shells .	-1
Easy to Google for benchmarks and details , as with the Tilt , this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented , inferior multimedia capabilities compared to other ( Samsung , LG , Toshiba , Apple , Nokia ) devices . Current Qualcomm cpus have been well-documented to be slower than even circa 2002-2003 PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia . It 's unfortunate a class-action law suite has n't panned out.Even with the poorly received CLIE NX/UX keyboards , Sony has n't improved their design.It also does n't help that this device was delivered with cracks in the casing so the whole first-batch of the US launch was recalled . Now what was a Nov 28 , 2008 launch has been `` back-ordered '' until January , 2009 .	-1
Here is a review of the Xperia X1 . I have owned the X1 , HTC Touch Pro2 , HTC HD2 , Nokia E90 , Nokia E72 , Nokia N95 and Apple iPhone . Other than the iPhone , I really hate this phone.1 ) Build Quality - the plastic on this phone peeled off everywhere ! The finishing on this phone is very susceptible to friction . The plastic chrome will peel off . The paint on the metal battery cover will scratch or peel off . The internal housing will crack . It 's like the device had an earthquake and cracked itself . I did n't even sit on the device or drop it on anything . There is no way to prevent the plastic from cracking and peeling . All of this happened within 6 months.The keyboard will also loose sensitivity . Over time , you will have to press on the keys harder and harder when you want to type something . The keyboard will only satisfy you for a year . And on top of that , the keyboard sucks . Do n't even think about speed typing on this bad boy.2 ) Efficiency - the phone is very inefficient . The terrible feedback on the keyboard forces me to use the virtual keyboard on the phone . On top of that , the screen is so small that using the virtual keyboard is a nightmare . This prevents me from being efficient with contact management and note taking . In deterred me from actually using the calendar and responding to text messages and emails . Unlike on the E72 , I was not motivated to be organized with the software.The phone is also very , very slow . Even with the latest firmware , it is very slow . This made me abhor using this phone for any reason . Do n't even think about installing software that runs in the background , because it will eat your battery and retard your phone . The only way to make the device run at decent speeds is to minimize the software and the ROM.3 ) Battery - the battery life is terrible . It only lasts 12-15 hours on standby without 3G enabled.4 ) Camera - the camera does n't beat the N95 , but it 's alright . The camera software is sluggish and is very uncomfortable to use . The camera has bad auto focus and weak flash LED.5 ) Multimedia - the speakers on the phone is very weak so do n't even bother watching movies or listening to music . Since this is a touch screen device , the screen is n't big enough for me to enjoy videos or web-browsing.The sluggishness of this device also applied to it 's Wi-Fi . That 's why I avoided web-browsing altogether . It was just plain terrible . In fact , I prefer the Nokia E90 or Nokia E72 for web-browsing ( they are non touch screen phones ) .6 ) Phone - the call quality and loudness was at least better than my Nokia E72 . However , the X1 speakerphone ca n't even compare to the E72 speakerphone . Please recall that phones usually have two separate speakers : the speakerphone/loudspeaker and the normal speaker . Well , the X1 has a very bad speakerphone/loudspeaker.8 ) Internet - the internet is slow , the screen is small , and the CPU needs an update . This should conclude everything.9 ) Price - at 800 U.S. dollars , it was an expensive piece of junk . But now that it is sold for 400 dollars brand new , it 's a little more forgiving.10 ) Something to consider - regardless of all of the cons I have provided , I enjoyed using the phone because it was highly customizable . Unfortunately , it lacked everything I expected from what was advertised : an awesome keyboard , perfect build quality , fast processor . I tried to make the best of it by customizing it with software and 'tricks ' and that alleviated some of the pain . Also , so many people complemented on the beauty of my X1.11 ) History on X1 : When the X1 first came out , all of the reviewers gave the phone high marks for it 's amazing build quality . Within a year , everyone noticed that its cosmetic and physical condition deteriorated greatly . The phone reviewers returned the X1 to the 'lenders ' before they got the chance to witness the true nature of this phone .	-1
Do n't know for sure if it was due to the cable or software , but never got this to work . Gave up when I got a tablet ( see my review for Motorola Xoom ) and realized Bluetooth works great to transfer phone 's photos . Price was cheap so it was n't worth returning .	-1
Bought to transfer photos out of my Samsung phone . Did n't work for anything but a charger . Save your money and go elsewhere !	-1
This was a waste of time buying it do not protect anything it should be called a shutterbox because your phone may breK INTO PIECES IF YOU DROP IT WITH THIS VERY THING RUBBER ON IT .	-1
This was the best case I had ever had at first ... then the light quit coming on on the face of the phone because the case stretched and began drooping and covered the sensors . I did n't ever remove it or stretch it , so this just happened over a 2 month period . The protection this case offers is awesome and I do love the case , for this reason , I just ordered the defender case . I hope it does n't have the same problem . I did contact otterbox about this problem and they were nice enough to send me a new case , no questions asked . I just feel like the same problem will occur again and I wanted to try the defender . I know many people with the defender case and all of them love it and have had no problems with it , so I recommend getting that one instead to have over a longer period of time . Hope this helps= )	-1
OK , HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ? I do now . Get the Defender case which has hard plastic and rubber . this all rubber case is a waste of money , but better than nothing . They are priced the same , so get the better one.this is going back .	-1
This case was absolutely perfect when I first received it . It offers great protection , is lightweight , does n't slide on a countertop etc , and is comfortable to hold . However , after 3 months of continuous use I noticed that when I placed a phone call when I took the iPhone away from my ear to use the keypad , speaker , access an app , or end a phone call the screen would stay black and would n't allow me to do anything . I went to the Apple store thinking that something was wrong with my phone however the case was the issue . There are little sensors near the speaker on the front of the phone in the little triangle cutout on the case . The case had stretched out and covered the sensors so once the case was removed it works perfectly .	-1
I can not believe that OtterBox puts their name on this product . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! ! This is junk .	-1
As many recent reviews have noted , this thing stretched out for me after about a month and now no longer aligns properly with the earpiece , sensors , and buttons . It is not as sticky as some other rubberized cases I have used/seen but , still gets stuck in your pocket and covered with a fair amount of lint . I stopped using mine and went back to the the Marware Sport Grip case which can get really linty but holds the phone nice and snug . The Otter is a `` Do n't Buy '' .	-1
I agree with the other reviewers . This completely awesome case will be nearly useless to you after a few months . Every silicone case I have tried for my iphone ( about 5 separate silicone cases by different companies ) will eventually stretch out of shape . In the case of this case ( hah ! ) - it stretches out of shape and if you are trying to use the camera to take a pic , the little hole for the lens no longer lines up ! So you end up taking half covered shots or you take it out of the case . Either way its very annoying.I really wish someone could make a case that wo n't stretch . Is it really that hard ? Can we send men up to a spacestation and rovers to Mars but we ca n't make a rubber case that wo n't stretch out of shape ? Of course I am clueless about chemistry .	-1
I have trusted OtterBox cases for years and I have relied on them . This case did not fit my iPhone 3 phone . I tried to return it , but the vendor did not to admit it was a poor fit . It may be a fluke , but that was my experience .	-1
The screen cover was stuck to the installation tab , which left residue and made the screen cover itself worthless . The cover is a stretchy silicon that offers little , if any , impact protection . The only thing it does is make the phone bulkier and a little bit less slippery . I was looking for something that would actually be protective , since my husband 's favorite trick is to drop his pants on the floor with his iPhone still in the pocket . The pants offer more protection than this thing does .	-1
Why when i type iPhone 4 case this comes up ? There is no reason for it ! Amazons Fault . Does anybody else feel this way ?	-1
It was white plastic , it did n't come with the hard shell just the sleeve that goes over it . My daughter disliked it and frankly so did I. I will have to do a little more research next time I buy cases for my phone .	-1
But it also gets caught in my hair and after a while , it actually started to interfere with the touch screen . When making a call and wanting to use the functions during the call , I would have to quickly pull the case off because the edges keep pressure on the digitizer and when you pull it away from your face , the screen does n't activate and light up like it should . So if you want to mute/use keypad/etc , you have to quickly pull the otterbox off and then the screen will activate . Annoying . I switched to a different case .	-1
The cover sags a bit after sometime and it does not fit perfectly anyways . I would not recommend at all .	-1
Bought this case and hoped it would be the harder version that is a little slicker and would not pull my hair but it does ! Works okay to protect the phone and for men or short haired women this would be fine , but if you have long hair , it will sure pull it . Also will not go easily into my back pocket . Going to look for another case . Bummed ... ...	-1
This case was just ok for the money but it was hard to get in and out of my pocket and it collected lint really bad.The same day that I put this case on it fell out of a locker onto the tile from about 3 feet up , it landed face down and made a small crack around the home button on my phone and the home button did n't work until i took it apart and reconnected it . I guess i got what I paid for though ...	-1
I bought this to put in my car as I am on the a lot of rural roads with poor service , and I like to stream music off of my phone . I was barely able to pick up a bar of service , no matter where I mounted the antenna , and I still dropped calls in typical spots that I dropped them before I had it . I could n't ever tell a difference when it was working and when it was n't , and after 3 months use the USB power port broke and it is now useless .	-1
I was researching ways to boost cell signals when I found this . After reading many reviews I realized that the issue of weak cell signals can be fixed , easily and permanently , with a cell phone that can use WIFI to make receive calls text and data . A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out . But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office . Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago . It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming . It also works world wide on WIFI for $ 5 a month . Service is unlimited and has no contract . An unlimited call and text plan is $ 10 a month , and unlimited cell , text and data is $ 25 a month . You do have to use their phone ( Moto X $ 299 or Moto G $ 149_ because they need Republic 's proprietary software to work . I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly . They give customers this link for $ 20 off when you join . [ ... ]	-1
I 've always been skeptical of cell phone boosting devices ( short of picocells that use your Internet connection and are officially sold by the wireless carriers . ) But given the mediocre AT & T ; ( yes , I 'm an iPhone 3G user ) reception in the heart of Silicon Valley I thought this device might help . A co-worker told me good things about the Wilson Electronics brand and this device is made and supported in the USA ! First of all , I 'm not a fan of using mobile phones in cars for the distraction reason -- and adding more lighter plugs and cords is a messy affair . So my goal of this review is to explain how the device works in my apartment sticking the antenna to the window . First of all , per the instructions , you do need to keep the actual device ( which you 'll keep near the phone ) AT LEAST 8 feet/2.5 meters from the included antenna or there will be no effective coverage change ( and the device will light yellow instead of green . ) After doing that , I placed a couple of calls with my iPhone ( and still had a dropped AT & T ; call , though that probably is n't the direct fault of the device ) and the 2 out of 5 signal strength bars did n't go up a bit . I was n't looking for the device to improve 3G or EDGE coverage as I 'm using WiFi at home for that anyway.As other reviewers have said , your phone needs to be within 6in to 12in ( 15cm to 30cm ) from the device to amplify the signal . Yes , I tried that and no change . That 's not real great for using a `` mobile '' phone if you truly need to be stationary . Then half the time when standing right next to it the light turns yellow which makes the device useless for boosting the signal . Maybe I 'm better off using theWilson Electronics 801247 Desktop Cell Phone Signal Booster for Home or Office - For Multiple Usersfor that purpose , but as I have n't tried that , ca n't comment on whether it really helps or not.The device , however , is well built . All the necessary accessories are included , and , handily , the device is powered over the USB standard so you can use whatever existing cords and adapters you may already own . Perhaps in some conditions with other carriers , phones , or a different location you 'll get better reception , and in that case , it might be worth the high asking price . I 'll have to try it out the next time I visit family in rural Marin County ( north of San Francisco ) where cell phone signals are very sparse to begin with to see if this device improves extremely poor conditions . I really wanted the product to work and the device is well documented , but I ca n't extend a positive review beyond two stars ( and perhaps that 's too generous . )	-1
This battery never made it through a single day 's use on my wife 's phone despite & # 34 ; breaking it in & # 34 ; with several charges . I would not recommernd this battery to anyone although I know the price is cheap compared to the OEM batteries sold by AT & T . I definitely do n't know this for sure , but if I had to guess , I 'd say these were rejects or recycled .	-1
Not sure what all th hip is about . This is one of the worst headsets that I 've ever owned , and beleive me I 've just about had all the expensive ones . The fit is just down right in the toilet . Constantly messing with the piece to keep it touching your jaw . The volume control is the worst design that I 've seen . I could go on and on about the design of this bluetooth , but why , , , Just let it die . Theres better ones out there , , , ie plantronics 510 and the Voyager/Pro .	-1
do n't buy this , no one can ever hear me , i have to repeat everything and always just give up and disconnect .	-1
I returned my Jawbone after just one very frustrating day.All control buttons are hidden from view and touch . Attempts to adjust the volume cancelled my calls.Not recomended .	-1
Krusell and Amazon are playing games with product coverage . 1.5 mos after purchasing , one of the belt loops came completely detached . Amazon wo n't return or exchange since it 's over a month old . Krusell claims to have a lifetime warranty , but after completing their online registration process for warranty , they require activation - which they never send ! Buy at your own risk - your product will NOT be protected !	-1
The material is of decent quality - good faux leather with seams enforced by strong stitching.However , as my title suggests , it is too snug of a fit for the Nokia N900 and the Samsung Vibrant , which it states it does ( the Vibrant ) . It is fine for insertion , but the problem is when you try to take the phone out - you have to REALLY yank the phone out . Since both phones are touch screens , I 've had too many instances where I mistakenly rejected calls trying to get the phones out.Not to mention it could be potentially disastrous when you yank it too hard and the phone ends up flying out of your hands.The inner dimensions are stated at `` 115x61x18 mm , '' which do not properly fit the Vibrant 's length and width - 123x64x13 mm- and the N900 's depth - 110x60x19 mm ( my own measurements ) .Look elsewhere if you have these 2 phones.MEASURE your phone first !	-1
Bought this for my 3GS and it did not fit right . Only came with adhesive ( double stick tape type ) that fit the top and bottom , not the sides . When I placed the glass , it stuck just fine on top and bottom but bowed a little in the center . It was not a problem with placement . It was perfectly aligned . Because of the way it bowed , the touch screen would not work properly .	-1
sO FAR i HAVE ORDERED 3 DIFFERENT REPLACEMENT SCREENS FOR MY IPHONE AND NONE OF THEM WILL STAY ATTATCHED TO THE MOTHER BOARD . THE DIGITIZER RIBBON SNAP IS THE WRONG SIZE ( TOO BIG ) AND WILL NOT STAY ATTATCHED . I CHECKED IT WITH A DIFFERENT ORIGINAL APPLE IPHONE SCREEN , JUST TO MAKE SURE IT WASNT THE MAIN BOARD AND ITS NOT . MY OTHER SCREEN SNAPPED IN JUST FINE . THE RIBBONS ON THESE SCREENS ARE WRONG	-1
My IPhone did not fit in the case - very disappointed . Was looking forward to using the case with my phone .	-1
Do n't let the picture and wording fool you . This is not a good product . Some type of fake leather wrapped around some thin cardboard .	-1
you get what you get for the price . The & # 34 ; magnet & # 34 ; to close lasted a day . Dont waste a penny on it	-1
Genuine leather .. ? the back piece is not leather , it 's synthetic and bad quality material . So , the belt clip in a few weeks later is completely damaged ..It seems that poor quality starts from the factory as one of the side panels also came unstitched.A star , they do not allow half placed ..	-1
This is a great looking case , especially considering the low price . Unfortunately , the side strips that hold the case together very quickly rip at the seam , leaving you with an unusable case -- worse , if they finally snap while you 're wearing it you could be dropping or losing your phone.I used to own a similar case for a different phone , and they used an elastic material for the side strip instead of the thin band of leather used on this one . The elastic band was perfect for the job ; the leather just rips within days . I purchased two of these cases , and they both failed the same way.Until the manufacturer rethinks the construction of the side strip , I can not recommend this product .	-1
Actually , the title says it all : Contrary to the website description , this pouch , while nice by itself , DOES NOT FIT AN iPhone 4 in a very thin protective skin ( and hardly fits it without the skin ) . The width of the pouch is insufficient . Ca n't use for iPhone 4 ...	-1
It looks nice but the quality is bad . Used only less than half year it 's broken already . Wo n't recommend this case to anyone .	-1
The pouch looked better in picture . After putting on the protective cover for the iphone , I can scarely put the iphone into the pouch . The pouch was so tight that it kept hitting the call button . I do not use it now . This pouch was meant for iPhone . Seriously , who do you know do not put protective cover on their iPhone . Should have made the pouch with a little more width . Not a lot of choices .	-1
For the price , you get what you pay for . This item is cheaply priced , therefore the quality of this case is also cheap .	-1
this case looks great but doesnt really offer anything in ways of protection . i dropped it and my phone poppped out of the case causing minor scratches on the sides . i know having the sides exposed doesnt protect it much anyways but i didnt expect it to fall out of its case so easily .	-1
Do yourself a favor and look somewhere else for a case for your Zune Hd . This case is NOT real leather as advertised and it 's suppose to have a magnetic closing device on it and it does NOT so the case never closes . I emailed the seller and they promptly refunded my money .	-1
This did case did not hold up very well . Although it 's really cute , it got dirty and fell apart rather quickly . If I could do it over , I would 've invested in a different case .	-1
I had one that was magnetic closure , this is a snap , wish I had known that , its is flimsy and not up to my standards	-1
The spring in the unit pushes the two way out of the 12v socket . I contacted the seller and got no repsonse.Update , it partially melted last time I used it . Fire hazard ? Possibly .	-1
So it is now in the closet maybe to be sold at a yard sale one day . bad purchase decision on my part , Great concept just does n't work with older vehicles	-1
I was really excited about this ! I wanted to be able to charge my phone and use my radar detector simultaneously , it worked great for almost a month and then all of the sudden it stopped . Nothing is broken or out of place that I can see and I never moved it but it definitely does not work anymore . I did get a refund and the sellers were very polite but the fact remains the same ... It does not work forever	-1

A weak cell signal is a common problem with concrete and metal buildings shielding those signals out . But we always have access to WIFI at home or in the office . Republic Wireless solved this problem over two years ago . It uses VOIP calling backed up by both Sprint Cell and Verizon roaming . It also works world wide on WIFI for $ 5 a month . Service is unlimited and has no contract . An unlimited call and text plan is $ 10 a month , and unlimited cell , text and data is $ 25 a month . You do have to use their phone ( Moto X $ 299 or Moto G $ 149 ) because they need Republic 's proprietary software to work at these rates . I have been using them for over 18 months now and it has worked perfectly .	-1
I tries several different spots through out my home and it just could get a good signal to replicate . I will try another brand to see if it works .	-1
I made sure this was compatible with my phone before i bought it and it is . This did not work for me at all . I was so excited when it arrived . i followed the instructions carefully and it still did not work , in fact it seemed to mess with my WiFi signal a little . do yourself a favor and dont buy this garbage . good thing i can get a refund .	-1
I went to great lengths to make sure I bought the 33 dollar one direct from Amazom . It came with Blackberry packaging and authentic looking markings . 2 weeks in it 's already failing to hold a charge throughout the day . I do n't know if it 's related or not but the unit now seems to reboot spontaneiously once every other day or so- I 'm talking the full 10 minute reboot too , not just a soft restart . Really unhappy with Amazon on this one . I bought a cheaper one about a month ago that was bad right out of the box . Why is it so hard to just get a real battery to replace the OEM one ?	-1
I have the white iphone and ordered a white color elago case to go with it . From the picture it looks nice but in reality , it 's cheaply manufactured plastic junk . IT 'S PLASTIC covered in white paint and the plastic edge rough and will scratch you iphone . Spend some more money and get a better casing .	-1
the case fits great but it only covers the back of the iphone . the chrome border is very exposed and still prone to scratches . the case also makes it hard to reach for the volume buttons . decent cheap case overall .	-1
Pictures would have you believe this a near mil-spec case , protecting your phone from shock , moisture and dirt . Not even close . Specifics ... Once assembled around the phone , the unit easily falls out of included belt clip . The two little ears on the belt clip do not securely hold the phone and case in place . At best , this is a case you store in your pocket or purse , although the case makes the phone quite bulky . With the phone in the case , the charge cord can not be connected , or at least we ca n't get any of the multiple chargers we own to work ( we own 11 I Phones ) . The outer rubber housing , meant to absorb shock is thin ... far thinner than standard Otter Box soft phone cases and the inner yellow shell is made of hard , unyielding plastic , so I doubt if this case offers much real protection if your IPhone is dropped from any height . This is one , poorly conceived design meant , I suspect to look tough but not much else . The Otterbox Defender Series 3 case fails in every way and given how poorly it performs , it is grossly overpriced to boot .	-1
i got my money taken up and all they did was reply thats it now i ca n't even contact them , i sent the otter back and never got the money do n't waste your time buying this	-1
Any otterbox is over rated.griffin is the way to go.period ! never buy otterbox . they are not as protective as many others . but they sold a walmart so its all people know .	-1
I own this and a Tilt , and I provide Windows Mobile applications and video drivers in my spare time.Easy to Google for benchmarks and details , as with the Tilt , this is another HTC/Qualcomm device with well-documented , inferior ( 4 TIMES slower ) multimedia capabilities compared to other ( Samsung , LG , Toshiba , Apple , Nokia ) devices . The FUZE actually benchmarks slightly slower than circa 2002-2003 200MHz PocketPC devices when it comes to multimedia . It 's unfortunate the htc class-action law suite has n't panned out.This does have a superior keyboard compared to the Xperia X1 , but the GREASY , finger-print attracting thin casing makes the phone feel like a toy . The `` Diamond '' points in the back of the case also will wear in less than a week due to the poor plastic quality.VGA is amazing on this device albeit wasted on less than 2.8 '' size instead of a more useful and eye-forgiving 3 '' . You can actually also take photos with this versus the blurring/stuttering Tilt camera , and the pictures look spectacular . Accelerometer-enabled album viewing takes much of the pain out of portrait vs landscape . Too bad the album still is n't syncable with Picasa or such for easy off-loading.However , the new USB drive mode ( directly accesses the microSD/HC and locks off access Windows Mobile ) , makes it easy to transfer files , or use a directory-based album browser for the photos.The auto-backlight tends to be too bright and does n't get dark enough in dark settings . Luckily there 's apps such as LevelSight that can deal with this.HSDPA is locked off until you work around AT & T ; 's registry locks so 3G speeds will be quite slow . This is either because the towers are overloaded by iPhones , or the back haul off the towers are only 1Mbps max.The Push-To-Talk is useless and there is n't an obvious way to reassign the button for some other use . Luckily , there 's some hacks you can Google for to reassign it to do two different things such as bring up the Comm Manager , and the Camera app.Another major issue is the GPS is really slow for the initial lock . It can take up to TWO minutes before it locks compared to a Tilt . Turning on A-GPS ( without signing onto AT & T ; Navigator ) does n't improve the speed and will actually cause all 3rd party GPSs to loose their GPS lock repeatedly ( in a 1 minute time span and beyond ) including Garmin Mobile XT and iGo8 after finally getting that GPS lock . Luckily again , there 's an app called FusionGPSFix that attempts to deal with this.It 's too bad this is a One and Company Design because the design is mostly about show and not reliable usability.For instance they destroyed the d-pad . It 's almost impossible to hit left or right on the 4-way direction pad because there is no pad , and the control surface is shared with 4 other buttons . You 're more likely to hit Dial or Home with a sloppy press for left . You 're more likely to hit Back or Hangup with a sloppy press for right . These limitations hit especially hard if you want to just navigate in the Calendar program or play a game.Combined with the bad d-pad design is sharing the same surface with an iPod capacitive scroll capability . Superficially , it would be nice for one thumb to be able to scroll iPod-like through lists and then hit the center button to select . Reality is the drawing a circle around the center button results in not very responsive behavior , and moving the thumb to the center for selection can cause accidentally more scrolling.It 's also inane to put the Volume and PTT button on the side of the slider face that makes it slide ! If you push any of these buttons , the whole face will twist and wiggle . This really shows the keyboard-slide was a sloppy add-on to the original Diamond design .	-1
When I plugged in the earphones to this adapter , I was able to hear sound , but when I talked , the person on the other end of the line could not hear me . I bought it so I could use it to talk on the phone , so it is worthless to me .	-1
i bought this for a friend of mine who has the samsung blackjack 2.Unlike other wired headsets , when you use this you can not plug it in before or after a call . you have to call someone , and then plug it it during the call.whent he call ends you must remove it becuase when you are not talking anyone , the adapter has a bad habit of constantly redialing and hanging up over and over and over.I am not sure if its the adapters fault or the phones but i dont recommend this . use a bluetooth instead or get a new phone ( or cell providor )	-1
Samsung 's use of a proprietary jack for both charging the phone and connecting a headset is a miserable design decision , from the consumer 's perspective . I 'm sure it adds to their bottom line . I 've tried three of these adapters from two different suppliers and none work with a known-to-be-functional headset . Giving up and going back to my bluetooth earpiece .	-1
I ordered 2 of these items and they shipped something totally different , then they shipped the right item but neither of them worked . One of them was broken , and the other one didnt pass sound wouldnt buy from here again . although they were kind enough to give me a refund thats good .	-1
Havent gotten them yet . Ordered them November 18th , and its December 9th . I emailed them and they said it is because they are out of the country and to gove it 2 weeks . It had already been more than that when I emailed them on Friday . So , I guess my kids will get them sometime next year .	-1
this is a piece of cheap junk . well i guess you get what you pay for in some cases . i bought this for my daughter and the tip broke off in her phone the same day that i gave it to her.the noise hush is real good.Big C .	-1
One end is longer than the other and its mic is bad i hate it and it broke after 2 months	-1
this is the 3rd or 4th pair of headphones they always stop working after a awhile . : / and its always one side of the headphone .	-1
The sound is terrible . The mic is bad . The ear buds are uncomfortable . The wires are thin and very fragile . If you have not guessed by now , I would not recommend . Spend a few dollars more and get better quality .	-1
Well , there is not much to say than `` you get what you paid for '' , this are really cheap headphones , the jack almost fell apart in my hand once i connected it to my laptop and even worse when i tried to unplug it , but again ... i got what i paid for.On the sound quality , average ... i couldnt ask for anything like `` Stereo '' or something like that ... at least they worked .	-1
its ok one ear phone is longer than the other after a while they will break on you u get what u pay for .	-1
Went through 3 of the 10 that were sent the first day I got these . I needed these to open a HP Sleekbook also a old iPod touch . Using them on the HP I broke 2 of them and 1 on the iPod . These are disposable tools once used so look else were if your needing something that will need to be used daily .	-1
I bought these strictly for the price which was a mistake . I needed them to help me replace the back housing on my Verizon Galaxy Nexus , which was all beat up by the prior owner . These spudgers came as described , but there 's a good reason you get ten of them ( 5 wide , 5 thin ) because they are flimsy . I broke two of the thin ones off trying to get the housing free from the digitizer . Once I got it pried up , the back came off with no further help , so , mission accomplished but only after losing two of these guys . Also , they are poorly constructed . Most of the thin ones had molding flash on the business end which had to be removed by shaving it off with a knife . Further , the ones that did n't break left little pieces of debris behind . In the final analysis , for light duty , you ca n't go wrong on the price . If , however , you do this kind of work a lot , pass these by and get something more substantial , say , from iFixit .	-1
Adquiri este telefono hace un par de meses pero no le habia activado hasta un par de semanas atras , luego que le hice la actualizaci & oacute ; n del software me dej & oacute ; de funcionar el edge . Lejos de eso todo bien . El empaque y el env & iacute ; o bien aunque no en su caja de Blackberry original	-1
This charger is reliable for about 6 months . It has recently started to not fully set into my phone tightly and unless I lay my phone , while charging , in a flat , stable surface , although plugged in , does n't continue the charge and is very loose . Probably going to have to buy another one because I do n't want to wake up in the morning and realize that I have no charge on my battery .	-1
I bought this as a second charger for my Blackberry Tour . It appears to charge the phone , but the phone is basically non-functional when the charger is connected . Once the charger is removed , the phone starts working , again .	-1
It worked for a couple months then just up and stopped charging my phone . I was very upset . I set it on fire .	-1
I bought two as spare chargers . I wasted my money they never charged and I actually think they ruined one of the phones . Thank God I have the protection plan and got the phone replaced . For the price I did n't even bother returning them . It may work for some but it did not work for me and my gs3 .	-1
I bought this for a gift and it was dead on arrival . Maybe it was just a bad one but the trouble it takes to return something bought online is just too much so I just trashed it .	-1
I DO NOT recommend it.It did not last very long , is VERY CHEAPLY made . Please dont wast your money on it . Pay a little bit more and get a better one . It is a piece of junk I had I known it I would NOT had purchased ! KarlaC	-1
Not reliable . I bought 2 and they both do n't charge very well . 50 % of the time it stopped charging for no reason .	-1
Gave it to girlfriend to use on her blackberry phone , she said it got hot and it stopped working . Maybe only charged phone once or twice ? ? ?	-1
Just like another item I bought from Orange Discount Center , it was n't OEM , even though it said it was . My fault . I know better .	-1
I had at least 4 sets of these . I run and they were great to run in except as one of the other commenter 's said they constantly cut out . I finally placed my LG up on my shoulder about 10 inches away and it stayed in contact.Every one of them quit working after about 20miles . Company said might be due to sweat getting in . They sounded great so I was hoping the company would fix this problem . So far they have n't . So if you are a couch potato who wants a wireless head set that answers the phone , these are great . 5 stars . But if your active and sweat just a little , do n't purchase . Donnie	-1
I was given a set of these and I ca n't for the life of me figure out why people like them so much . The sound quality is great but there is no bass at all , but thats kind if expected for the size . Call quality is superb and hands free works flawlessly too . Very comfortable around my head too . Battery life is also great . So why is it I hate them so much ? The signal ! Its terrible ! Do n't expect to work out with this pair . The more you move the more your audio cuts in and out . And if I stick my phone in my pocket it cuts out to the point I usually get frustrated and shut them off and use my loud speaker . Ashame really , if not for the signal issues i 'd give this pair 5 stars . But its a major deal breaker !	-1
While the sound quality is awesome , the limitation of not using these outside is just plain dumb . I had two sets of these- thinking the first one was defective . In smaller enclosed spaces like offices , living room , airplane seat , etc. , they work great . Try to use them in a large fitness center or outdoors like for jogging , cycling , etc. , and the audio cuts out about 3-4 times each minute . Apparently , the bluetooth receiver in this thing is n't very sensitive so it depends on walls to bounce the signal from your player to the headset . No walls = poor performance . At first I thought my first set was defective . But after getting a warranty replacement and experiencing the same problems , I read the instructions . ( I know , I know ) . They explain that you should put your music player in a back pocket , preferably as high/close to the headset as you can . How dumb is that ? I did find that if my music player is placed in line-of-sight within 6-8 inches of the headset , it works uninterrupted . I had a great deal of trouble jogging while holding my MP3 player behind my head.One more thing that really bugs me . Motorola outsourced its customer service jobs to outside the United States . If you care about this , ( as I do ) , you might want to know .	-1
I was so excited when I got these headphones ( no more cords ! ! ! ! ! ) . The first time I used them walking across campus they worked great with no problems at all . They were/are very comfortable around my big head . But the 2nd time I used them was in a crowded restaurant and the voices from a couple of movies I tried to watch ( online then a different movie on iPhone ) were inaudible . I tested it once I got to a quieter place and I could understand what they were saying but I do n't think this would work while on a treadmill . And the reason I 'm returning them ; today while walking across campus trying to listen to an audio book it kept losing the signal . I do n't know if it 's interference from others around me or what but headphones are pretty much useless to me if I ca n't use them in anything other than the library or a tomb .	-1
I had several copies of the previous version of this and they were great until they died which was typically around 6 months after purchase . I do n't know whether or not this model is still sold but it is too heavy over the ears .	-1
I never use them - always cutting out , even as normal telephone headset . I tried with multiple types of phones , and it just does n't cut it .	-1
I have no idea how Motorola can claim this as ever being a 'flagship ' of their stereo bluetooth headphones . I had no problem syncing it , installing it , figuring out how to use the buttons ( though they are a bit small and annoying ) . However , I never use it , because it drops syncing with no provocation . Compared to my much cheaper motorola stereo bluetooth headphones ( S305 ) , these simply do not work . They sync for 3 minutes and then drop the connection . I can re-sync , I can stand in the exact same spot listening to the exact same music on the exact same phone as my S305 , and the S305 works just fine and this piece of carp just skips and then drops the signal . And this is using a MOTOROLA phone ! ( Z6m ) Do not buy any S9 or S10 or S-anything from Motorola , unless you like to curse . My only questions , how could the S9-HD be an upgrade from the S9 ? The S9 must be used as a coat hook only .	-1
I tried the S9 because of the reviews . A mistake ! ! ! The fit , wrapping around the back of the neck and pulling on the ears , drives me crazy . I used the S9 only for iMac computer . Had a terrible time pairing.But the tight grabbing at the neck fit was totally un acceptable.Exchanged for the Jabra Halo BT650s set and have loved the Jabra Halo 100 % .	-1
These headsets sound great . My problem with them is due to my usage . I use these when I go running or I 'm at the gym and I tell you they are terrible for that . It starts off okay but then as you move , the bottom & # 34 ; power & # 34 ; button becomes very VERY sensitive and gets pressed when it bounces off the back of my neck or back . This has a domino effect in that , suddenly the volume goes to the max or the track skips . Lately I 've noticed , it hates the charging also . When I plug it in , it may or may not charge . I like the idea but the execution is terrible . I would not recommend it . I 'll use it until it dies and will just simply buy something else .	-1
It fit my wife ok but for me now way . Had to return it . Also from what I could hear it was not very good .	-1
I got Motorola S9-HD for a week now because I did not want to deal with wired headphones while running . The product I have received came in original box with authenticity hologram attached to the arm.The short of it is that when it works , it does the job great and sound quality is very good . Contrary to other reviewers , I have a pretty comfortable fit . Pairing is also very easy . I like the button placement etc . I had it paired with both my laptop and a iPod nano wireless transmitter ( i10s ( Luxurious White ) Tiny Bluetooth iPod Transmitter for iPod/iPhone/iPad/iTouch ) .I have a couple other Bluetooth headphones but they were not suitable for active sports . While this one does better job of staying on my head , there is a big annoying problem with signal cut-offs . S9-HD frequently loose signal with the transmitter . I can not keep the iPod reliably in my pocket . I have to hold it in my hand . I thought the issue was with my wireless transmitter but these headphones do the same with my laptop when I am sitting directly in front of the laptop and also my other Bluetooth headphones do not cut-off this frequently , at such a short distance.Edit : The cut-offs seems to be less when both iPod and S9-HD are fully charged . When battery starts to drain over time ( say an hour or so ) the cut-offs become more often . Either the battery is too small or not fully charging fully ( or both ) . Perhaps , with a few more charge/discharge cycles the situation may improve . I 'll update this review if I see an improvement.Edit2 : The cut-offs are continuing after over a month use . It is such an annoyance and probably a flaw of this device as my other bluetooth devices does not have this problem . Unfortunately , besides Motorola S9 and S10 , the other Bluetooth headphones are not suitable for active sports .	-1
As soon as I plugged an item in ... nothing happened . This does not work or connect solid enough to get my car 's 250 PSI air compressor to work . ( I tried to pump up the tire of my wheel barrow . ) And yes , the compressor works fine plugged in to my car 's lighter .	-1
It is okay but only works if you use it with something which requires very light current . I got a new one replaced by them but that had the same issue . This was being upsold along with Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator but never worked with it	-1
Of course , I wanted this to run an inflator to blow up mattresses and paddleboards . No such luck . Its not designed for that . You might figure that out by reading the amp rating , but I ask you : What is this thing good for if not for running an inflator ? What do you have that only has a 12volt plug that is 1 amp or less ?	-1
I got it so I could plug the Slime COMP02 12-Volt Tire Inflator in a wall socket but eventhough the little diode lights up it does n't power the inflator ! ? Not recommended .	-1
I have not tried all the various functions of this phone , but it seems to work for everything I need it to do . I do n't like the round prongs power plug , but I had an adapter since I have lived in Shanghai for the past several years . I think the user interface is simply horrible to use . The various functions are needlessly buried in layers of senseless options . Try to make a call to a company that says press 1 for English , 2 for Spanish , etc . You have to press and hold the touch screen area called unlock . Then you have to press another area to get a touch screen numeral pad . By the time you get to this point , the number you called is asking you if you want to repeat the options . The microprocessor in this phone must be the slowest on earth . Everything is so slow and counterintuitive that I get upset everytime I use it . In text mode , they use the same layout as a digital phone . Why they did n't have the option of a Qwerty keyboard is beyond logic . So there you are pressing every button once , twice or three times when it could have been a full keyboard layout . It does have the option where it tries to guess the word you are spelling , which is good . The phone is usable , but frustrating to use in my opinion . I tried to give it to my brother , but he returned it to me saying it has the worst user interface in the world and he would n't take it even if I paid him money .	-1
I 'm not sure what is going on with all the high ratings , but I was sent a flimsy plastic case that was painted , poorly , black on the outside and white on the inside - plastic as well . This will quickly scratch the phone and has nothing to prevent plastic-on-plastic scratching . Of course , this is what you get for ~ $ 8.00 ( cost plus shipping ) I suppose , but you need to think twice before purchase if you want your $ 200 or $ 500 phone ( depending on contract or not ) scratched in days.By the way , there is not a single thing rubber about this . Absolute false advertisement . I might have been sent the wrong item , but the invoice and package do not indicate that .	-1
I bought this because of the name ... ... Samsung but it does n't he characteristics of a real Samsung product . The charger is flimsy and the cord is small unlike the unit that you get when you but a phone . Not worth it in my judgement .	-1
Not secure , and does not fit my HTC EVO 4 phone . It seems small even for the G1 , but I do not have one to test . I did not realize that there was closing system such as even a zipper . I knew there was no secure flap .	-1
Bought one of these as a convenient way to charge and sync my Ipaq Glisten . While it will charge , it simply wo n't connect to the computer via USB . Tried it with another phone and another computer . Still no joy . There are other similar products on the market that work . So buy one of those , not this piece of garbage .	-1
Ratchet failed after a few weeks . Bought another , failed again . Also , data communication is not reliable ; became worse over time . `` zipcord '' ratchet was better , but its data capacity also deteriorates over time . But both of these charge the phone just fine . Data communication works perfectly with a short non-retracting cable with Gold-plated plugs , so I believe the cause of my problem is dust or cold solder on my laptop 's USB socket . Wish I could find a retracting reliable ( short is OK ) gold plated cable .	-1
USB cords just are n't able to survive in this kind of design . The cord worked for a few days but soon it started losing connection with my phone . Every few seconds the computer would drop it then find it again , and repeat . It would charge the battery but I could n't use it to transfer data once it got like this .	-1
Cable connection is not good and will damage your devices.seems to charge ok , but so does if you get a good cable , and keep inserting-removing from the USB port ... the phone will not even flash the charging state if you are fast enough , and that 's what happens with this cable . for data i keep get reconnects all the time to the point it 's impossible to transfer one large file . which proves the connectivity and continuity in the cable or connectors sucks big time . tested 2 cables.No phone shows you micro disconnects on charging , you may not even not it 's flashing on and off.will not even bother returning . will probably use the spring mechanism for other cables i have around , but this one i would n't use to connect to my expensive phones . at all .	-1
It works , however is apain to use . The cord is VERY short to be practicle , I assumed the lenght would be standard , NOT ! It..is a hassle to use it , you have to pull it soo tight , then it comes out/unplugged , ie with cp used as GPS et . Additionally , it gets tangled to rewind it as short as it is . Although it works I do not reccomend it.KarlaC	-1
I have had this in my ownership 3 days.Today went to plug in my phone to the PC and POW ! Spring over there , 3 pieces of plastic broken over there.Yes the wire still works but it is NOT retractable anymore ! THIS IS GARBAGE !	-1
From the moment I got this product it was broken . When you pull the cord out to extend it , it 's supposed to stay extended but it always snaps back into the retracted position . This means I have to keep my phone one inch away from my PC to use it . Was n't worth the cost of shipping to get it replaced . I suggest you purchase a slightly more expensive model with a `` push button '' lock to keep the cable extended .	-1
I bought this item and it 's competitor & # 34 ; Micro USB Retractable Cable - Ideal for Any Micro USB ... & # 34 ; . The another one looks more durable . This one already broke while another one still works .	-1
I honestly have to say this product had no quality it only lasted a week and one of the ear jacks already broke not to mention that they really do n't stay too well in your ears in the first place	-1
The product is good , it just does n't work for me . The little rubber fittings that go is the ear always slide out . Defeats the purpose of handsfree if I have to hold them in . When I looked at the product , I could n't tell this was the style . A better choice would have been made .	-1
I have owned now 2 BB brand headsets and both failed ( one side stops working ) . I have now replaced it withAltec Lansing UHP326 Backbeat Series In Ear Headphone with Ultimate Ears technology . It 's more expensive at $ 30 but worth it !	-1
I dont think this wrked very well for me . People couldnt hear me too well.. Just good for listening to music	-1
I use a number of earbuds that fit in the ear like this . The others do n't bother me , but this one does.Otherwise it works fine .	-1
This headset sucked and for the price it just annoyed me to pay that much to get a cruddy result . I lost lots of calls and no one could her me ... awful .	-1
I 'm totally convinced that this bluetooth headset from VXI BlueParrot Roadwarrior was n't a good choice . It has n't a very good noise cancellation and its clarity is n't a great new . I tried another product .	-1
It worked great for 2 weeks , but now it disconnects about 5 minutes into a call . I do n't know why . I reset it , reset the phone , re-paired the headset , did what I could , but it 's useless now . Returning it.Also , the head band is a bit too tight -- gave me a headache , but I was willing to live with that for the clarity . Oh well .	-1
These are not made to be used everyday with a phone that gets lots of use . It will work for a while then once the wire gets bent it will split .	-1
I was looking for an adapter that I can use with my Nokia E66 cell phone for regular earphones ( 3.5 mm plug ) . If I fully plug it into the cell phone the sound is mono , but if the plug goes almost all the way into the cell phone I get the stereo sound.So , the adapter does n't work as described but I had to find a way to make it work .	-1
It does n't work on a lot of phones ... .And I do n't know why . Sometimes it works , sometimes it does n't . Kind of disappointing .	-1
Can not get audio out from the 3.5 connection . I tried several standard headphones . More so , when plugged in , the phone starts auto-dialing last dialed numbered.I spent quite a lot of time trying to understand how I can make it work . Searching and reading over the Web taught me that it is no slam dunk . 2.5 and 3.5 connectors can be wired in a number of different ways and support mono , stereo , mic , etc . There are plugs with 1 , 2 and 3 rings ( respectively with 2 , 3 and 4 connectors - the connector is the metal part between the rings ) .However this is HTC part meant to work with my HTC Mogul Sprint phone - and it does n't . My conclusion so far is that this adapter came with some short of a defect or a 'short ' in its wiring though my empirical tests are not conclusive . For example , I can get mono audio out by plugging in a telephone headset into the 2.5 connection . The weird thing is that if I plug my stereo standard 3.5 headphone into that same connection ( using another 2.5 to 3.5 adapter ) I do not get audio.After many frustrating hours I came up with one workaround that works - plug an earphone into the proprietary port and check for sound , then plug another one in the 2.5 and test and then plug -slowly- the 3.5 in - this gets me audio out and then I can unplug the other two.I just returned mine and ordered another from the same vendor . I hope the part was defective ; I shudder to think that is how it is supposed to work or that there is a problem with the phone itself .	-1
I was fairly excited to hear about this product . While I do find the iPhone screen simple to use , I thought I could get some extra finesse with this thing.Well , finess is one thing it does not have . It is very light - and there is a sort of conductive foam tip . This foam tip seems quite flimsy and I have no confidence it will remain attached for very long . The whole thing is put together with perhaps 20 cents worth of stuff - and they have the gall to charge $ 15 or more for it.So - to the function : It take a great deal more effort to effect the screen than your finger alone . The screen really does not read it well - and you have to push far harder than I am comfortable doing.The screen does recognize it - eventually - but really - it 's flimsy tip is the problem in my mind.Overall - not worth the effort or the $ $ - fingers are free and work far better on the iPhone or iPod touch . Get a nice screen protector and you will be far happier .	-1
Nice headphones , wireless and lightweight . But the short live time of the battery makes them pretty much useless . I get two hours maximum . Then I need to recharge them which takes another two hours . Wireless headphones need to be able to work for at least 8 hours to be useful .	-1
I bought this for my wife to go along with her Creative Zen M300 4GB player . The concept is great . Small , light weight headphones that are bluetooth . We had problems right away . It was a pain to connect earbuds to mp3 player because the lights on the earbuds were not doing what the instructions were saying . I started playing around with it and after an hour figured out what the lights on the earbuds were indicating . The earbuds hold the battery that you recharge . You pull back the flap on the back of one of them and you plug in the charger . Even though my wife has small hands , she struggled with getting the plug into the earbuds . This caused a lot of frustration and the back of the earbud eventually broke exposing the charge port on the earbud to moisture from my wife 's workouts and it eventually stopped charging . The sound quality was not very good . As for battery life , expect 2-3 hours with normal volume . I have low expectations of bluetooth in general , and these were worse than what I could tolerate . I read reviews where folks had great success . Unfortunately , we were n't one of those couples that had great success with these .	-1
After 4 months of moderate use , it stopped working . After many customer service hours and phone lines , I found out that they no longer back this product . If it breaks , you 're on your own .	-1
I bought this thing to replace a Samsung that sounded great but was a little clunky . I was immediately dissapointed by the charger that was clearly designed for some other item and kind-of-half-way attaches to one earphone . It 's not a micro-USB type , but something that must be plugged into the wall -- NOT your 2 USB car charger , next to your phone . The actual headset was remarkably sleek , so I kept an open mind during the eight-hour initial charging session . I was again dissapointed at once by the flat , tinny sound that finally came through the stylish and lightweight headset when I finally played the new coldplay album from my Android phone . I am no audiophile but the sound from these earbuds was really , really noticeably poor compared to the Samsung they replaced . If you like heavy deep base you are really in for a let-down . In summary , it looks cool , it 's functional , I 'll wear it to the gym , but it sounds substandard.UPDATE : Downgraded to one star . After listening to these earphones for an hour , I decided that the sound quality was unacceptably poor . Fortunately , Amazon has a fantastic way of handling returns and I was able to print a return authorization and shipping label -- postage included -- for a full refund . My first return experience with Amazon will make me less hesitant to purchase items online and more likely to choose Amazon over other sellers .	-1
This headset died in 2 months , just after the warranty expired.I took a look at the online forums and it seems that I may have bought a & # 34 ; knock off & # 34 ; . I 'm no expert on supposedly original devices , but I would 've expected to be original if purchased from Amazon.Anyway , do yourself a favor and buy the LG headset . It 's durable , has a battery indicator , and it does n't die on you after some light use .	-1
Sony does not seem to care for customer needs . They once again are behaving stubbornly with just another proprietary charger instead of simply using the universal usb that most serious companies use . Why do they want to force us to carry another charger ? When is Sony going to care about customer needs instead of just thinking how to extract a few more pennies from us ?	-1
While this headset is unique and quite sleek , I ca n't say too many positive things about this . Here are the list of reasons why this headset is terrible:1 ) Fidelity - The sound quality was on par with a set of Coby earbuds , all mids and no highs or lows . I had the earpiece properly inserted into my ear , sounds horrible . Do n't understand why some reviewers are saying the sounds are great , it truly lacks bandwidth and frequency response.2 ) Charging - Looks like the & # 34 ; charger & # 34 ; was an after thought or their attempt at recycling old stock . You get this whacky , what I guess is a cell phone charger , but only a few pins on the charging are used , so only one & # 34 ; latch & # 34 ; out of two of the connector on the charger-side is used . The charger looks Mickey-Moused.3 ) Lack of Volume and Next Track/Previous Track - Ok , no volume control I can deal with , no skip track or previous track ? That renders it unusable . A while ago , I figured out that making playlists were really a waste of time , so I like to randomize my entire mp3 library on my iphone . No next track/previous track means I have to whip out the phone . The default corded iphone earbud with remote allows me to skip to next track , adjust volume without having to whip out my phone . This feature is what garners this product a two-star.4 ) Wrong Material Choice ? The rubber on the ear bud fittings are of chalky , & # 34 ; dry & # 34 ; feeling rubber , as such , it will not grip the inside of your ear . The slightest movement will make the ear bud fittings work itself out of your ear . I miss my AcoustiBuds by Burton Technology . They seemed to have gotten this part right , why ca n't a corporate giant like Sony/Ericsson get a simple material selection ? Did they not test it ? Did they test it on their own moist ear and said & # 34 ; good enough & # 34 ; and called it a day ? This is a piss poor selection of material , these in-ear buds have been around since they started handing out headsets on airplanes some 30 years ago . With today 's wider selection of all sorts of exotic rubbers , they could n't get this little detail correct ? 5 ) The remote ( if you can call it that ) seriously is in a wrong place . It 's too high up . I think this length was design for people with shorter necks . It just was n't well thought out.6 ) Accessories that came with this earbud - the little clip that came with it is a joke , and removing the clip damaged the insulation on the wires . The protective bag is just a cheap cloth bag you find in gimmicky audio accessories from generic manfacturers.What ever happened to Sony ? This brand has really gone down the drain . Their TV sets suck , their audio accessories suck , their video game console sucks , everything from this company as of late really sucks . This company is a joke . And partnering/absorbing/merging with another dying company like Ericsson is n't really helping Sony developing good products at all ...	-1
I am by no means an audiophile - but for people to say these have good sound is crazy - I was so excited when my iphone got the 3.0 update because I thought for sure that stereo bluetooth had finally evolved ( based on these reviews ) -- my first experience was with the motorola s9 - which sounded crappy too . These look awesome out of the box - but the sound quality was terrible - now these are songs that I have purchased from itunes if that makes a differnece -- but the sound made these basically unusable -- as I have found with previous BT stereo headsets - oh well -I guess I 'll keep waiting .	-1
Randomly my phone will stop charging then start back causing the screen to go on and off constantly . This probably is n't that big of a deal , but I ca n't imagine it is very efficient because it is not charging half the time . I think it is the part that plugs in that is causing this issue , not the cable .	-1
These headphones work as they 're supposed to , but the fit is so poor it 's weird . Despite the fact that the cups are large , they seem to touch you only in the middle , and the whole affair is so loose that it becomes a balancing act to keep them in place.Unfortunately there 's ai n't much choice on the market for headphones with discreet mike that go over the head . I 'd happily pay more if there were an alternative .	-1
I had read plenty of reviews of wireless headsets . I really wanted a headset that I could wear in the gym and be active in while still listening to my music . I 've had terrible luck with arm bands in the gym . So I thought I 'd give this a try . I 've already gone through a Motorola headset that died after two weeks . The reviews on the Sony are positive so I thought I 'd try it.This headset works quite well . The base unit is smaller than about the size of a man 's thumb in my estimation . The unit comes with a few different ear buds to switch out . The cords do get tangled easily though . Then again , most headsets have that problem . The unit paired in seconds , charged well and keeps a decent charge . On some of my songs , the sound is somewhat tinny but still good.Usage is a bit odd . The cords are not long enough so that you could clip it to the end of a sleeve . And if you wear it in the gym , you 'll have to clip it to your collar of your shirt . And this is a bit odd . Basically you 'll have a thumb sized bulge on or under your shirt at neck level . I 've gotten a few stares because it looks weird . Then again , while running on the treadmill , it 's super convenient.The iPhone is the bummer since it does n't support the full volume control and track skipping . But this unit works just fine beyond that . I 'm very happy with it.Update : I must have doomed the stupid thing . Minutes after I wrote this review , the unit wo n't power on any more . I have no idea what happened but it 's dead . Thankfully it 's under 30 days so I 'm returning it . Downgrading my rating to two stars . The price is fine , just a shame that it might not be that sturdy .	-1
All buttons work and functions normally however there were several scratches and paint chipping . It feels quite old and very used .	-1
A total waste of time . Folks , learn the hard lesson I 've learned , ONLY order items frm PRIME certified sellers . Ohterwise , you dont know what youre getting , spending your money like going to Vegas . Its a gamble .	-1
Battery came quickly and in good condition . It 's in my cell and seems to be working fine . The true test will be this next week while I 'm at work . So far so good and it looks like I would purchase from them again in the future . Will update next week .	-1
I purchase this battery as a spare for my blackberry phone . When I placed the battery in the phone it did n't even recognize it . I plugged in the charger and the light continued to be red for over two hours . I have sinced moved and lost it which is great because I still have the phone with the original battery that works fine . Do n't buy this it 's a waste of good money .	-1
Refurbished , I believe . Terrible batteries . If your going to buy these , I would recommend buying at least 3 ... I only bought 1 . It did n't work . As soon as I got the package , I swapped batteries with my old one in my blackberry . I charged it for about 3 hours before checking the battery level . It was stuck at 90 % ... when I unplugged my phone from the wall charger , the battery died within 30 minutes . It does n't hold a charge . Wow . $ 7 is too good to be true for a good battery . ( $ 7.00 is with shipping . )	-1
This is apparently a listing error by Amazon . They do happen and they can persist for some time.The cable measures 33 inches long , that 's not even 1 meter , much less than 1.5 meter.I have no quarrel with the Amazon Marketplace vendor whom I bought from or Amazon . Mistakes happen.However , if you need a 1.5m ( 65 inch ) cable as I do , this just wo n't do.Yes , the cable does work , but it is not what is described , what I ordered or what I thought I was getting . Thus , 1 star : the product described is not the product you get.Jerry	-1
Should read 1.0m not 1.5m . I got the cable and it clearly showed ( on the bag holding the cable ) that it was 1.0m . I contacted the vendor to ask what to do and they told me to check with Blackberry on why they switched the cable on the vendor . If I were you I would n't touch this product or work with this vendor .	-1
It 's a pity . This worked fine until I got the 1.5 `` cupcake '' update to my G1 phone . Now it is not recognized by the phone , so it 's useless .	-1
It will charge with a car charger and work with a cd player that has an 3.5mm aux outlet on it at the same time . You just have to buy a male/male audio chord and plug that into the HTC headphone jack wire that comes with your phone . But if you are looking at using the 3.5mm jack on the adapter , then this is going to be useless . Your phone wo n't recognize the after market headphones that is plugged into it , unless you buy the `` Sound Route Switcher '' on the app market.Overall , it works great for roadtrips but , not good for taking on a walk or jogging . The adapter will just add more weight to your phone .	-1
This phone connected to the internet via WiFi yet gave me so many freezing problems both on and off the internet . I ended up with the Nokia 5530 and have had no freezing problems and am very happy with that phone . I can not recommend the Nokia 5800 because of the freezing problems . And I did think the 5800 was a very pretty phone with big screen had it not been for those freezing problems ... Oh well , life goes on ! Glad now I own the Nokia 5530 !	-1
I was sorry to see that what could have really given the iPhone a run for its money is actually trailing ... Here is what I liked:1 ) Great sound ! For a phone , the full body sound from its stereo speakers was amazing ! Great for music , and as a speaker-phone.2 ) The size - fits very nicely in the hand . Body is plastic - but feels solid.3 ) Fastest GPS initialization I have ever seen in a portable 'period ' let alone a phone-gps ! 4 ) Great video playback.5 ) Loved the handwriting recognition.Here are my dislikes:1 ) The Phone user interface is lacking . Especially if you use systems that require DTMF tones to operate . There were several occasions when even after getting the soft dialer on the screen , the digits did not send out the tones - on other occasions it did - I was not able to figure out what I was doing differently to get consistent behavior . The phone had to go back because of this.2 ) Applications just suck up power - if you use the phone for more than th e phone , you 'll run short.3 ) Application hangups - podcasts downloaded caused the media player to get stuck . Had to cycle power to restore.4 ) Email application does not support HTML.5 ) No flash player6 ) WiFi selection is stupid ... it does not automatically pick known wifi when in its proximity ... 7 ) Feels the phone could use more horsepower.I 'm waiting for the N97 ... Cheers !	-1
JANUARY 2010 UPDATE : After having used the Nokia for a week , decided on returning it because of the short battery life and then even with an updated firmware , the screen became unresponsive needing turning off and on again the device in order to use the phone features . As much as I like Nokia , they still have a long way to go with touch screens.INITIAL REVIEW : After one year using a Nokia E-71 which I dropped and stopped working , I searched for a replacement and found this XpressMusic5800 for $ 219.00 OnLine . Ordered it from the blue computer store and have been `` playing with it '' for only 24 hours . Nevertheless , being a recently introduced device in the US , thought on sharing my first impression for those who are considering it.Users familiar with Nokia products will love how user friendly this phone is . Those unfamiliar with Nokia , might have a hard time setting up the many phone 's features but it 's worth your time . Once you open the box , will find a device much smaller than what you thought it would be . The most attractive thing is how narrow it is . Slightly shorter than an I-Phone and E-71 , much narrower than both but somewhat thicker ; a tad more than half inch . Included is a wired remote control for the player , mic/headphones , the wall charger , strap , MicroSD card and a mini disk for installing the Nokia features.On the upper part of the device there is a micro USB dock , the port for the regular headset , the charging port and the on/off switch . On the right side there is a volume switch , the unlocking switch and a separate camera switch . The left side houses an 8GB MicroSD card ( included ) and the SIM Card from your phone carrier . The expected Nokia strap hooks on the lower left side of the phone . The battery is on the back , facing downwards and to access it you need to remove the whole back cover . The phone comes in shiny black which is a fingerprints magnet.When you turn it on it vibrates , shows the usual Nokia welcome and then allows you to program it . I was able to configure my two main e-mails but guess you can do several more . On my E-71 I had four different mail accounts constantly receiving messages . The native wallpaper is black with some waves but you can easily change it to your favorite photo . I downloaded several screens from the Apple website since the screen is somewhat similar to the I-Phone and I-Pod in shape and dimensions.On a very T-Mobile way , you can have your `` four favorite people '' on the main screen and once you touch their corresponding picture/icon , the phone shows a history of calls made , received , text messages and e-mails ; quite innovative . On the lower area you have an icon for phone dialing and another for your contacts . The phone dialing keyboard works only in the vertical position but the font keyboard is accessed also while the device is horizontal . Making a call trough the contact list is very easy the device is loaded with features.Call quality is excellent and even at its loudest setting there is no distortion . The touch sensing screen is not as fast and accurate as the Apple devices but good enough for not needing the stylus that is housed on the rear of the phone . As a music player it is outstanding . Playback is trough the two micro speakers on the lower sides and sound quality as well as stereo separation are very good . Nokia offers on this device all the goodies that make them unique such as saying the caller 's name/ID , unique caller ringtones & photos and several customizable user modes . There are many features that I have not yet tried but will do during the next week or so . My service is with ATT and works in both frequencies ; EDGE & 3-G , Now , the limitations of the Nokia 5800 : First ; the battery life . Nokia products have been famous for their extended batteries . My E-71 could be used without recharging up to three days . On the 5800 , the battery drains in six hours . The stated four hours of talk time and two weeks of standby time are far from reasonable.What I did to prolong battery life was disable the vibrations when the screen gets a command , disable the 3-G ( use EDGE only ) and made the Bluetooth available for search for only one minute . As of today , with regular calls , internet use , e-mails and music , after 15 hours of nonstop use , the battery still has like 40 % charge.Second and quite disappointing , the installation mini disk as well as the software upgrades on the Nokia Website is not compatible with Windows 7 . After downloading all the suites , OVI , and ancillary software , many of these do not work with Win-7 . Then tried these with a NetBook running Win-XP and no problem with the updates.Having stated all this , I consider that for the price paid ( $ 219.00 ) , the Nokia 5800 is a bargain when compared with their 51XX and 53XX series , mostly because of its music playing capabilities , awesome call features and quality . But in my case , the battery issue might make me consider other alternate phones . Let 's see what I decide and meanwhile , I hope that this initial review helps you to decide if the Nokia 5800 is the phone for you . In case that you are considering an I-Phone , you should wait . The new , smaller and slim I-Phone 4-G goes on sale in June 2010 .	-1
Phone features are very nice . However after a few months , it started to shutdown without warning ( battery was charged ) and sometimes , when this happens , it would erase the entire contents . I 've contacted amazon 's customer service several days ago asking what I should do , and did not receive any replies . Despite the fact that this is a nice phone , it 's better to buy a more sturdy one.UPDATE : I 've contacted Nokia USA which confirmed the phone is under warranty and asked to ship the phone to be serviced . They returned the phone with the same problem . I contacted their customer service and they asked to send the phone again . Waiting for the outcome , hopefully the phone will be really fixed this time .	-1
Oh Boy , where do I start a review for this product.I saw this product on Sale at Dell website and overly impressed with the specs and the reviews on Amazon - almost immediately I ordered one for myself and just about to order another one for my wife . I put it on hold till I try out one of them - glad that I did not order the 2nd one.Initially I did not like the idea of going for a $ 30 data plan with At & t ; and being stuck to a service provider for 2 long years and badly wanted to buy something with no data plan.Let me break down each of the feature functionality of this product in detail - it is probably the most detailed review you will find on this product . First the good part and then the bad stuffAs a phone - receive/make calls : 10/10===============================Full marks to Nokia as a phone - the phone has excellent signal reception , compared to any of the smart phones out there in the market . I have used a blackberry/iphone/samsung and Nokia score above allCamera ( stills ) : 5/10===============Camera is good for outdoors , but very poor for indoors - the photos look very grainy . Front camera is decent and you can use it to make video calls with your friends running fring on their iPhone/Android and other nokiaCamera ( video ) : 7/10===============Video quality is excellent , I have shot a few videos outdoors and almost compares to HD qualityCamera/Video/Front/Rear switch : 2/10==============================Since the phone feature video , stills , front & rear camera : Switching from a video to still and back to video . Switching from front to rear camera and back is so difficult and non-intuitive . I am a pretty good geek with stuff and I found it extremely difficult and confusing to switch between different modes.Calender , Memo ... : 5/10======================Can sync with Exchange on your computer , but can not sync directly with exchange servers unlike android/iphones which can directly connect to your company servers . Which means , everytime , you need to connect the phone to the computer for syncMusic player/Video : 7/10==================Music player output is very good , lacks a audio book player . It does not playback divx movies ( sorry torrent folks : ) Youtube playback : 2/10================Ok , I thought I will be able to use this to play youtube videos to entertain my daughter while driving we are driving . I was not able to play even a single youtube video without pauses and jerks , made several attempts and finally gave up.Read on the forums and some suggested me to use the desktop version & try it on wifi - But even on Wifi , while it is better than 2g/3g - it is still disgusting playback speed.I was very disappointed with this whole youtube playback partYahoo/Gmail access : 3/10==================Imagine that you open a mail and it comes up as new mail & lt ; href image= ... . > This phone does not even support html emails , no images either . Other than that , the good part is that it does a pretty good job of syncing with Gmail & Yahoo and downloads the emailsKeyboard : 7/10=========The keyboard was a bit impressive - you have 3 options - mini keyboard , full size keyboard or you can write in your handwriting . I liked to input text with the full size keyboard as this one was the most convenient.Apps : 2/10====Yes , there is an app store , but it the store is so poorly organized and very user unfriendly that you would end up spending hours to find the right app for you.Next the apps itself - there are some decent apps available for gaming and productivity , but if you have used any android/iPhone app - you will realize that Nokia is waaaaay to behind in the game.Touch Screen : 3/10=====================First of all this is a resistive touch screen , means you need to actually put pressure on the screen for it to work , unlike the modern day capacitive touch screen which will only need you to just touch and the screen will pick up static charges from your fingers.So the Nokia 's resistive touch screen works , but it is very poor in response - you will almost always need the accompanying stylesRadio : 3/10======It does have a radio , but it will not play unless you plug in the headset which acts as a antenna . Even after plugging in the antenna , it picks up a few strong signals , but did not pick up some of the weaker signals neither indoors , nor outdoors.GPS ; 4/10====I have a 3 year old GPS from garmin and I thought I will throw it out after I get a Nokia . Oh oh , big mistake . The Nokia phone comes with a assisted GPS ( means it does triangulation with satellites as well as with cell phone towers.While the phone does a good job of finding your current location , it is extremely poor in finding directions and reading out the street names and directions . It works , but it is no where near to a regular GPS or a built in GPS like the ones in iphone/android=========== summary =============Honestly , I have never felt this frustrated with any phone in my life- when I really wanted to love this so much.Nokia - where art thou ? come down from your ivory tours and give us a good phone . We do not want to be stuck up in the vicious circle of At & t ; and apple - we want unlocked phones and we do not want to see crappy phones like this from you . Pls wake up .	-1
DID not fir my phone and I forgot to send it back . On screen the battery resembles the one that is in my phone but I received a completely different battery . I shoulda sent it back but I forgot	-1
I purchased this item as a temporary replacement bc i lost mine . I didnt read the reviews correctly . So i was surprised when I found out there is no way to get on the internet at all with any data plan but i was only going to use this phone till I ordered my insurance replacement . It worked fine for three days and would n't turn back on . I returned it and I am getting my refund . So far they have been very helpful and quick . I mailed the phone back Monday and Thursday I got an email saying they have issued the refund to my bank and its being processed with the shipping amount I paid to have it returned ! ! for this alone Im giving it two stars . Fast and Easy refund !	-1
I got this phone for my little sister ... . she broke it the first week and overall it could n't do a lot ... so not my fav .	-1
I have wanted a sidekick for a couple years and finally found this one for under $ 50 , and I did n't have to extend my contract . I opened the box , put the battery in , my sim card and SD card and it worked.Over the past couple days I have made a list of the pros and cons.Pro : It has a real cool screen with awesome color that swivels open and made everyone at work say Ooooo ! Cons : * I think there are more buttons than you need , many are repetitious , but they look impressive . Most of the functions take several steps . I work with computers and accessories all day , I am not intimidated by something different . But this was not a well thought out design . * A tiny button on the top opens the camera . It 's a very tiny black button , flat to the surface and the same color as the phone so its hard to find and difficult to push , I used my fingernail when I found it . You can take both photos and video . I somehow got the camera into video mode and it took a while to get it back to photo . The picture it took was good quality . * There are no one step calls as with other phones . There are several ways to make a call which I wo n't go through , but it is neither easy nor convenient . The swivel screen is in the way when making a phone call . The basic function of a cell phone should be making calls quick and easy . The Sidekick gets an `` F '' for that . And the same grade for reception . My last phone , a very basic and inexpensive phone , gets reception in places this one ca n't receive or make a call , like in my house . * I do n't think this phone should be categorized under slider , I have a slider and closing it is a simple one hand move . This does n't slide , it swivels . * With all the functions they have available , there is only one alarm . * I had TMobile turn on data so I could download features I need like another alarm , but The phone was never able to access the Internet so I cancelled that service . * It makes loud annoying sounds for whatever you do , opening the screen , keystrokes and just about everything . So I adjusted the settings to silent and turned the ring volume up , a multi step process through the menu . When I am at work I turn the volume down , then later when I turn the volume up , it resets all the sounds back on . * Texting is not easy to access , another multi step process . Getting texts is in a whole different location than writing a new text . * There are many buttons , and some just duplicate what others do . It looks impressive , but that 's all . * The screen and buttons are not customizable so there is no way to set up one step shortcuts for features you use often.Everything that other phones do with a simple one or two steps , this phone requires attention to what you are doing and has multiple steps many starting from the menu . Doing almost anything with this phone is like carrying your PC around , and trying to get into programs without shortcuts on the desktop.This is not a phone you can hand to a friend and tell them , here , use my phone . You either have to dial for them , or hand them the users manual . Which in this case is a DVD .	-1
It did not work for me . It is not that adhesive and creates bubble easily . I tried it till the last film ( 3 films ) but still the same . Good thing it is cheap . Well ? That 's the price i had to pay & what you pay is what you get ! My bad . Good thing seller gave me a refund thou . : )	-1
Bubbled up by button and earpiece , did n't like this product , would n't buy it again and I do n't recommend it.Hope this helps .	-1
I MUST SAY THE PRICE WAS AWESOME.. BUT I MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SOME BAD ONES.. BECAUSE THEY WOULDNT STAY ON.. : (	-1
I was not happy because I have to take my phone out of the Otterbox Defender series ( what a pain ) to snap the phone into place in this holder . I do n't love having to do that but , if you dont use a case it does hold on to the windshield great . The suction on the windshield is great .	-1
this broke in a few days of using it never going to buy this again waste of my money good luck to everyone else	-1
What junk . I am terribly disappointed in the lack of quality these sweatshop made covers have . They feel like cardboard painted with clear polymer . It is a huge Rip Off .	-1
The case is skinniest case that I found but still with some grippy sides to avoid having the whole thing slip out of the hand . It does not provide protection i the top edge or bottom edge of the iphone , as well as over the volume & vibrate buttons . I would have liked to make this my only case , but when the leather which seems to be glued on literally started peeling and ripped off of one entire edge ( see picture ) , I had to demote it .	-1
I bought this `` leather '' iPHone 5 case before I received the iPHone 5 . The phone arrived before the case , so it took a long time coming . I know better than to order anything other than Amazon Prime , but this case LOOKED good from the `` description '' . NOWHERE on the box does it say the case is leather . When I took it out , it was sticky and had the look and feel of plastic coated fabric . It even has a fabric grain . I also know better than to order from this seller , as I have had dismal experiences with ordering cases for other devices . They arrive and do n't fit right , but to return them you have to pay almost what they cost to purchase . Not worth it all the way around . This case WILL NOT protect my iPhone 5 from anything , let alone a fall ; and the feel is downright off-putting . It seems like a hastily made case to try to cash in on the iPhone 5 rush -- but they could n't even get it here on time with plenty of pre-order time . DO NOT order this case if you are expecting leather ; and no where in this world would it sell for the supposed retail of $ 49.95 immediately reduced to $ 9.95 before it ever came out . It is an opportunistic way to cash in on the 5 needs without providing a quality or usable product , and severely misrepresenting this . DO NOT BUY , unless you are willing to write it off when you do n't like it , because return will cost -- even on a defective and misrepresented product .	-1
Very uncomfortable , people could not hear me well at all ; would not stay in the ears . I sent back .	-1
I 've had 2 . I used one set that broke after about 4 days . I believe it was damage from sweat . The power button quit working . I sent the other one back just because I regretted not getting a refund in the first place . I have owned multiple bluetooth headphones and I know what the normal range is . These have very poor range . The will disconnect with out line of site . Especially when you are outside . Do not work out with these ! Not only will the sweat break them , but they do not have range to play music in your pocket if you are outside .	-1
I was given this headset to use during my workouts . After less than a month , it 's started malfunctioning . It will randomly ( and repeatedly ) activate phone functions such as redial or voice control . When this happens , it becomes impossible to turn the headset off . Eventually it goes back to normal , but then it just starts malfunctioning again . Seems it ca n't handle a little sweat , which seems odd for a device that is made for sporty use .	-1
I bought the 906 version which is identical to the 903 , but adds a bluetooth transmitter dongle for non-bluetooth devices.This is my 4th Plantronics bluetooth device and the 2nd that has been stereo BT . I will be taking this back after a day of use for these reasons:1 ) These are uncomfortable . I hate ear phones and love earbuds ( or canal phones or In-Ear-Monitors ) . These seem to be somewhere in-between . After about 30 minutes my ears hurt . Granted , I 've been using Sony earbuds for the last 8 years , so that 's what I am comparing them to . I can wear my buds for 8+ hours with no discomfort , I 've been wearing the Backbeats for 3.5 hours today and they 've been uncomfortable throughout . You only get one size and I 'd say I have average to small ear canals.2 ) These only sound alright . Again I 'm coming from 8 years of the same $ 60 earbuds from Sony . These have a lot more treble and sound tinny to me . I had a much better experience with the older Plantronics 855 stereo bluetooth which used earbuds similar to the Sonys . I like more defined bass that gives rock and alternative music a punch . The Backbeats make music I am familiar with sound much less dynamic . I had to use the bass boost option on all music . I think most people will be fine with the sound , but more discerning listeners should look elsewhere . There is a feature called OpenMic which is supposed to allow you to hear the outside world better when you press a button . I had no problems hearing around me with this option turned on or off , one of the 2 settings just adds a low static hum.3 ) I made one phone call for 30 minutes while driving in my car with the windows up and after 5 minutes my friend told me to take them back because I was difficult to understand and my voice sounded `` hollow '' . They were functional , but not transparent . On my end , I had no problems understanding my friend so no complaints receiving.On a positive note , all of the buttons on the Backbeat worked as expected with my HTC Incredible . I was able to pause , back track and forward track songs , adjust volume . Pairing was easy . I use Meridian music player on my Incredible and the Backbeat controls it well . If you go into the Meridian player 's preferences you can turn off the headset controls and that will allow you to control Pandora , Last FM and Slacker . Slacker sounded terrible - it seemed to have a dramatic lack of bass which I 've read is a known problem with Slacker when not using Wi-Fi.Battery life seems great . I 've been listening to music and made 40 minutes of phone calls for the last 4 hours and the Backbeat battery indicator shows that it is still 1/3 to 2/3 's full . I 'm not willing to use these any longer due to ear discomfort.The over the ear design was n't too bad when I had my thick Arnette sunglasses on . But add a baseball cap on top and you 've got a problem . The cord behind the neck is solid , but as others have noted , if you want to lay with the back of your head against a pillow or headrest , it will significantly apply pressure to your ears and this really highlights how uncomfortable the Backbeat is to wear.The separate dongle that you get with the 906 model worked as expected . I had to go through the pairing process each time I switched between my Incredible and the dongle . I 'm not sure if there is a better way , but it did n't seem automatic after the initial pairings.Bottom line , do n't bother trying these out unless you can take them back for a full refund . They look good on , but if they do n't fit you just right , I think you are going to be disappointed . I 've also read that there may be some huge reliability issues with the Backbeat and they do not seem to hold up to sweat so you should probably avoid these at all costs .	-1
I 've a had my now for a little less than a year . I bought them last May and they have stopped working ! I will still probably buy another set because over all the $ 40 is cheaper than buy the $ 15 wired earbuds that last about a month . I just want the manufacturer to admit these are not sweat proof and make a pair that really are water proof it can be done !	-1
I 've owned the product for 3 years . I bought it and a Plantronics Voyager Pro at the same time . The Plantronics Voyager Pro failed 1 year and 1 month later . The folks at Plantronics basically said `` tough , would you like to buy our latest model ? '' They had no interest in the fact that I was dissatisfied , and had contacted them several times about the call clarity of the unit . ( They blamed it on my iPhone , even after I exchanged the phone for another one to resolve the issue . Then they said it was an iOS issue that would be taken care of in an upgrade . Then later said , too bad , your exchange time is up , live with it and hope `` Apple '' fixes the issue . Turned out it was n't an `` Apple '' issue . ) Since everyone I talked to regularly was complaining about the call clarity on their end of the call when I used the Voyager Pro , I decided to look on it as a chance to replace it with something from a different company . ( They also complained when I called from the airport on the Plantronics BackBeat 903 , but I used it so seldom for a call it was n't important , the stereo sound , without tangling wires , was nice on the plane and in the airport . ) The Plantronics 903 BackBeat , purchased at the same time as the Voyager Pro , was purchased solely to use on airplane trips . It has only about 80 hours of total use , and looks brand new ... including `` standby '' time , it has only been turned on about 81-82 total hours in the last 3 years . It has been stored in a special travel case ... which I purchased for it , in my dresser drawer with some clothing . I got it out yesterday to check it for pairing with my phone for a trip I intend to take next month . It did exactly the same as the Voyager Pro when it died ; worked for a few minutes , fluttered , quit , and refused to re-charge or turn back on . I had bought Plantronics products because I have an 8 year old Plantronics bluetooth headset ( that I still use as a backup ) ... .it still works fine and nobody complains about the call clarity when I need to use it . The quality of their older models was excellent , both in use and longevity ... you really got your money 's worth from their earlier products . ( I bought a Jawbone Era to replace the Voyager Pro , and everyone has always been very happy with the call clarity ... it is two years old now , so I recently bought a Bose bluetooth headset , and again ... everyone is happy with the call clarity . ) My point being , that something seems to have happened with Plantroics manufacturing quality a few years ago . Their older bluetooth headsets were well made , reliable , had good range , good battery time , and the call clarity was wonderful . The products I bought 3 years ago , including the Plantronics 903 BackBeat just turned out to be a big waste of money . Unless Plantronics has revisited their `` roots '' and begun making quality products again , knowing what I do now , I certainly would n't consider this headset . The 903 BackBeat would not have held up to someone using it for jogging or exercise ... it did n't hold up , even for occasional use while traveling on an airplane . Anyone considering this headset should take a look at other products . I 'm not sure Plantronic 's newer stereo headset model is better , but I do n't think I will risk it.I 'll either used a wired headset when listening to stereo music , or enjoy the sound in only one ear from the new Bose headset I bought ... .it really is fantastic how rich the Bose sound is when playing music ... even though it is only in one ear . I really hope they come out with a stereo bluetooth dual ear model . After my past experience with Plantronics poor customer service , I 'm sure a call to them about a hardly used , 3 year old , 903 BackBeat would be another futile waste of time . I really do n't expect my electronics to last more than a couple of years with constant use . But , anyone should expect more than around 80 hours of use time from a product they spend , $ 99.99 for ... .the price was still on the box from the `` Apple Store . '' ) If I decide to buy another bluetooth stereo headset , it will be some brand other than Plantronics . I 'm glad I read the reviews and did n't buy their latest single ear headset when I bought the Bose instead last month . Stick with Jawbone and Bose , you will be happy .	-1
I bought this headset to replace my beloved BlueFox 401s . I like to listen to audiobooks during my long commute . If I have a lot of telephone calls , a full charge is not enough to last all the way home in the evening . The issue with the BlueFox is that there is no iGO tip available , so I ca n't charge them at work unless I carry around the wall charger . The BackBeats charge with a standard micro USB tip ( A97 ) . They fit on my head much the same as the 401s except that the flexible ear pieces fit a little more comfortably . The controls work very well with my Droid Eris , while only some of the 401 controls worked properly . I love the behind-the-head style headset because my hair hides the headset so nobody can see it . The behind-the-head part on the BackBeat is flexible.This headset is multi-point , you can pair to more than one device at a time.If you are trying to decide between the BackBeat 903 and the 906 , the only difference is that the 906 comes with a bluetooth adapter for devices that do n't support bluetooth . If you are using a mobile phone the 903 will work.UPDATE August 18 , 2011 : Although I really liked this headset , after less than a year of use it stopped working . The volume suddenly dropped so low that I could n't hear . It happened while I was listening to a recorded book from my iPad . No amount of messing around with the controls or resetting helped . I ordered the Motorola S10 as a replacement . I dropped my review to 2 stars because I think a headset should last longer , especially since I was not a heavy user - only one or two days a week .	-1
The wire in back will chafe your neck and grip your shirt collars , the buttons are not ideally placed , the FF/REW/VOL switch is cool but slow to operate , and they 're inconvenient to charge . They are n't complete junk , but I do regret having kept them . : ( Update : the left earpiece does n't sit in my ear no matter how I orient the multiple adjustments .	-1
THIS DEVICE SHOULD BE PULL OFF THE SHELF AND TOSS THEM IN THE TRASH.THEY NEED TO REFUND CUSTOMERS . IT DOES NOT TUCK INTO THE EARS . YOU HAVE TO HOLD IT WITH BOTH OF YOUR HANDS TO LISTEN TO IT WHICH NOBODY WANT TO DO IT . THE IDIOT WHO APPROVED THIS PROJECT SHOULD STEP DOWN AND FIND ANOTHER BRIGHT PERSON	-1
I had it for about 2 weeks . The Altec Lansing Backbeat sound quality was good when it came to music . However , sometimes when I was receiving calls the caller could n't hear me & vice versa . When the call did work and came through the caller complained of excessive background noise . But the main problem I had was the fact it did n't want to stay snugly on my head ... in my ears . I am a female with , what I 'd like to believe , an average size head , but at times one side would come out of 1 ear and I 'd have the worse time trying to get it coiled back around my ear to stay . While finally getting the one side fixed , the other would come off . Very annoying . It could have just been me , but it should n't be that difficult.Over all , it connected to my phone ( EnV Touch ) very easily & kept the connection in spite of where I was at or what I was doing . I returned it and will be trying the Motorola MotoROKR S9-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headset .	-1
I bought them to use with my iPhone 4 . It worked great for 24hrs . All the controls worked and life was great . Call quality and sound were both very good . On the second day , the pause button stopped working and I could n't change tracks anymore . Resetting and reconnecting did n't do any good . I sent them back and am now looking for other options.Believe me , I wanted to like this product ... and I did when it worked . Maybe you 'll have better luck , but for the price luck should n't have anything to do with it . Sorry Plantronics .	-1
Unfortunately I had to return this headset as many others complain of the same problem . The audio is lost when your in movement . I tried keeping my cellphone very close to the headset to no avail . Needless to say , they 're of no use if you have to keep entirely motionless .	-1
The product itself seems decent . Quality is good etc . however it was advertised as fitting a Galaxy Nexus , it does not . If you have a Galaxy Nexus and want your phone to fit completely in the case do n't buy this . Because it wo n't . It sticks out top , the screen part that sticks out is not used for the disply but is doens't look good . Very dissapointed for the price I paid for this . Do not recommned it for larger phones at all .	-1
I received it broken , and they did n't offer to replace it . You get what you pay for . Do not buy ! ! ! !	-1
I purchased this charger for my Samsung Google Nexus phone , and was quite disappointed . While I believe that it might have technically been able to charge my phone if it was off or not in use , it did not meet my needs . It was unable to charge the phone while I had it on and in use for navigation . At best , it was keeping the phone at the same charge . I believe this was a 700mah charger , and my 2000mah charger is doing a much better job . YMMV , but I 'd suggest looking elsewhere .	-1
Made in China.The quality of this Samsung unit is questionable.The two halves of the case do not line up correctly , there is excess molding around the front where you insert it into the 12v cig lighter . The sticker was on crooked.I think this thing is a fake . Works fine on my Girlfriends Samsung galaxy , but doesnt work on my LG . Came in a small zip-loc style bag with no other information.I 'd avoid it and get a different unit . I have owned samsung products in the past and they never have released anything as poorly built as this .	-1
Do n't work , as simple as that . Tried in the 3 cars of my house just in case . I 'll have to buy another from another source . Shipped in time and in a normal-good package .	-1
Should have read reviews before I ordered this item . Do n't both buying for the Samsung S3 . Snail pace charging . I wasted my money .	-1
I receive this charger after 10 day and it stop to work after hourpiece of junk pleas to not buy do n't spent your money on this charger	-1
The product claims to have a `` Dynamic IC Chip '' ( a built-in smart chip that recognizes a full charge and automatically switches to a save-mode that protects your battery from over charging and preserves your battery 's life span ) and I can not verify that the feature is working . How do you tell that it 's stopped charging ? Because the green light on the charger stays lit all the time , even after the phone says it 's fully charged.The green light could not be brighter . It 's distracting in its brightness . It is SO bright , I 've put a piece of masking tape over it . Sounds pretty attractive , right ? ! ? It is very hard to plug it into my vehicle 's outlet -- I have to really shove it and both the charger and the outlet bend in the struggle . My last charger inserted much smoother . My last charger had a longer cord too.Good thing I did n't need it desperately , because it only ships one way : By mail from China .	-1
Have had a few samsung chargers like this one before , and they honestly do n't last very long at all . Do n't understand why the crap out so easily , but be advised that you are taking a chance .	-1
Worked fine for about 3 months and then it just stopped charging , swapped it between a couple of cars and all had the same effect . Checked the fuse and it was n't blown ; it just stopped working .	-1
This looks like it 's built well and has engraved & # 34 ; Samsung & # 34 ; , but I have had nothing but trouble with this charger . It fits too loose in the socket and the wire has to be wiggled and held in position for a constant charge . There are def some loose connections . Vendor sent me a replacement that wound up doing the same thing . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I am highly disappointed with this product . Not to mention I received this product that fits a little loose into my actual car charger . It charges my phone on and off now . I really thought I would n't have to buy another charger for a while , but it looks like I was wrong ! I bought a usb car charger ( I just hook up my usb cord to my phone charger ) for about 3 $ from walmart and this product lasts longer and is more durable . I find it quite sad and I would never buy this product this again . It 's like I threw money out the window go find another product .	-1
I bought this charger and it did n't work . I obviously would n't buy it again , it was frustrating to plug my phone in and never have it charge .	-1
When I originally wrote the review I stated that this charger actually worked . And it did . Unfortunately , only for a couple months then it just died . I do n't know what happened , but I had to throw it out . Do n't waste your month on this . It 'll end up in the same place mine did ... the trash .	-1
This item is very cheaply made and fell apart in multiple places within a few months . The microUSB port got twisted and bent so that it would not connect . The DC plug in section came unglued/attached and the wire got loose . The whole unit basically just opened up on its own and could not be closed again in a way that it would stay closed . Had to just throw the whole piece of junk in the trash . I do not recommend this product for any price .	-1
It was working fine for a while . Then it began to take longer to charge until it eventually conked out , which is why i normally like to wait before submitting a review .	-1
Within a few weeks of having this I had to have the phone at a certain angle for it to charge . Then , the wires on the inside wore out . Do n't buy it .	-1
I confirmed my suspicion after purchasing a real OEM Samsung charger and comparing it with this product side by side . These are cheaply made Chinese knock-offs . Stay away from these . They do n't work ! ! ! !	-1

bought this phone from west net online and wouldnt charge , got a relacement and the same issue . these are old phones with dead batteries or nearly dead batteries . dont waste your time or money . if you want an iphone i suggest you go with a newer model unless your able to change the battery yourself . just not worth the time or money . two iphones and none of them worked , so a word to the wise , buy something newer .	-1
Do NOT buy this phone . Just do n't . The phone is slow and there are not many apps that can be used on this outdated phone . Also , my phone got stuck on the apple logo start-up screen after a few months of use because of the jailbreak . This phone was horrible . Do not waste your money !	-1

I bought 2 of these for me and my wife , the price was just that good ! Granted , the price is just too tempting , I do n't like the sound quality ; it 's just too distorted/muted . When talking to someone , they need to concentrate when talking to me ; things I say are not very crisp . It became apparent to me when talking to my wife , she has to clearly say everything so I can hear her.Today , I got frustrated and asked her to switch to her phone , the sound clarity amazing . This is the main reason why I 'm returning the headsets.If you 're looking for a cheap hands-free headset , this is for you . I 'm looking for better sound quality though , so I 'll be exchanging these two for something else ( probably PlanTronics Voyager 510/520 ) .	-1
it was very cheap . it didnt really work and was very uncomfortable . BEWARE OF THIS PRODUCT . although its inexpensive it is not worth your money . TRUST ME .	-1
Everyone could n't understand me on this headset with my iPhone 4s ... they said my voice was garbled and would cut in and out . : ( I ended up buying the Plantronics one instead ( see link below ) and it works SO much better ! No complaints on that one whatsoever . I initially went with the Samsung because I trusted the name brand . Do n't make the same mistake I did ! Plantronics M50 - Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Black	-1
Our Motorola Bluetooth died after many years of use . Coincidentially this SAMSUNG WEP 460 was on sale and seemed a bargain but buyer beware , you get what you pay for.With the Motorola Bluetooth when you open the thing to attach it to your ear the unit turns on . When you remove it and close the ear thing it shuts off . This Samsung WEP460 has to be pushed to turn it on and off which is a pain in the neck to get used to and is an extra step . If you forget to shut it off after taking it off the power stays on and the battery will get drained.Worse is the fact that the charger it comes with is a standard AC adaptor for recharging inside your home . The way the packaging is , the charger is hidden inside a plastic bubble container and hidden behind black paper . You have to look very closely at the back of the packaging where an image that is 1 millimeter is shown -- look closely at that fine line drawing and that is how you will know the charger inside is AC for indoor use.We had been in the routine of using the Bluetooth when driving the car and charging it in the car and just leaving both the Bluetooth and its charger in the car all the time . We do n't presently own a cigarette lighter car recharger that fits the SAMSUNG WEP460 so that would be another purchase for us ( therefore raising the price of the cost of owning this unit vs the Motorola Bluetooth ) . Today I see the compatible cigarette lighter car charger sells for MSRP $ 45 which is more expensive than this SAMSUNG WEP460 Bluetooth unit itself which seems crazy ! The sound quality is just fine.We regret this purchase . Next time we 'll buy the Motorola Bluetooth.We also learned a lesson that the cost of these accessories is not just the accessory but the charger units . When replacing existing accessories you can save money by purchasing accessories compatible with the charging units you already own .	-1
Very uncomfortable . None of the different ear buds fit my ear and you could barely hear any sound on the highest volume .	-1
I ca n't believe Samsung puts their name on this piece of junk . I mean , who would sell a product , designed to fit on the ear , and be held in place with a flimsy piece of plastic ? The warning of things to come was the fact that 2 ear clips came with the unit . And , once the 2 clips break , the piece is unusable.So , you get what you pay for ! Junk .	-1
THE JABRA EARPIECE HAS BETTER DEEP RICH SOUND . ITS A MORE REALISTIC SOUND AND THIS HAS AN ANNOYING BEEP EVERY NOW AND THEN	-1
I 've had a number of bluetooths before . A couple of Motorolas ( which I love ) , an Emerson , etc . This one has great sound quality . The volume is pretty low when you first put it on , but after turning up the volume it works great . The buttons are easy to press and it answers without any issues and seems fairly reliable . It comes with two ear hooks , but not two different sizes . It 's strictly a replacement if one gets broken or lost . It also comes with several speaker covers , so that it will fit inside your ear better . It 's too bad then that the ear hooks do n't come in sizes . Also there are no instructions at all on replacing the hooks nor the covers.My problem is that it refuses to stay on my ear and rubbed a sore right onto my ear . I tried switching all the speaker covers , but that does n't have anything to do with the ear hook . Also , because there is no wire in the hook , you can not bend it to fit your ear properly . That is a definite design flaw . I have tiny ears compared to the average person . This bluetooth assumes that there is a lot of space between the side of my head and the edge of my ear . That is not the case at all with my ears . This is why a curve is important for me , but there is none and no way to make one.In fact , if you look carefully for a side view of this bluetooth , you 'll see that there is no curve whatsoever for the ear hook . It is commonly known that all should have a slant . I guess you get what you pay for . I never had this issue with my higher grade models . The ear hooks were both comfortable and reliable . This one makes my ear bleed and will not stay on . It 's not how I put it on , my daughter ( who works at Radio Shack ) even tried to help me , but without success.If I could replace the ear hook , then it would be a top-notch bluetooth , but that is impossible so it gets a lower rating . Sorry Samsung !	-1

I bought this to replace my 5 year old Plantronics . Which still worked great but the flexible earpiece was finally beyond my tweakability.With pretty decent reviews - and a sale price trying to be frugal - I got what I paid for.Binding issues . This puppy does n't stay connected well to my HTC Incredible . Anytime It gets somewhat separated I have to push the connect/device button on the android to get it to reconnect . It 's very frustrating and my Plantroncs was awesome about staying connected / re-connecting.Volume does n't go up quite enough . I drive a Toyota Tundra and a Honda Odyssey which are both pretty quiet ( both loaded vehicles ) with a little truck road noise ( tires ) or kids . And it 's barely loud enough if there 's no other traffic and/or kids are quiet.Noisy to callees . People I call always complain about having difficulty understanding me so it does n't do a good job of cancelling ambient noise.For both Noise and Volume reasons I end up driving with my left hand cupped over my ear and towards my mouth . Hands free ? Not longer ! Battery charge life is also poor . So unless I keep it plugged in ( problematic with the AC only adapter and a pita ) I never know if it 's just failed to re-connect -- or is dead again.No more inexpensive / mid / low end headsets . You get what you pay for . Be sure to look for good reviews on noise cancelling , power , binding . And compare against more expensive models - as that 's where you usually get references to `` this replaced my crappy xyz '' which you may otherwise find got good reviews from people that got lucky or did n't know better etc .	-1
I got this and found it to fit me like a brick in the ear , then changed phones and it would not sync with new phone . still have it , using it for target practice .	-1
I like to keep my reviews short and simple . Do n't buy this item for your BBry 8900 . Look elsewhere for a quality product .	-1

I bought this as a replacement for my husband 's iphone . Previously he had the noel collection case which came with mirror screen protector . This product compared to the old screen protected is extremely poor quality . The mirror is very faded and when in active mode it makes your screen a green/blue color.I know these are cheap but I recommend going for the better quality ones . I went for these and now have to buy a better one and pay shipping all over again , do n't make the same mistake .	-1
This screen protector is very thick and therefore , very easy to apply . However , the mirrored surface makes the display on your phone dark at best and invisible in bright light . I t makes a glare that you can not see through . I plan to return these even though it 's not much money .	-1
Do n't like it , when I in the sun outside cant see the screen and it was n't reusable at all .	-1
This screen protector performs as shown . What it does not tell you is you can barely see the screen after applied . I increased the brightness to 100 % and still had a hard time seeing the screen .	-1
Do not buy this product , not worth your money ! The mirror effect is blurry and ca n't see anything . Service was great but product not worth it !	-1
i bought these as a replacement for the screen protector i purchased when i got the phone . my old one had been beaten up and had a few nicks in it ( after a year and a half ) . i put one of these on a few months back and it 's already pretty beat up . it works but is n't great quality . i would recommend getting some at at & t or sprint for a few more bucks . if you do n't mind changing the cover ever few months , these are a good cheap option .	-1
I expected the mirror screen protector to be like the one i have on my iphone right now . Instead , it 's a cheap funhouse mirror type of mirror ... who wants to look at that ? ?	-1
These do not work well . You can not see the mirror portion and it is very difficult to apply . I would not try a product similar to this again in the future .	-1
THESE COVERS ARE COOL BUT IN DAYLIGHT OR OUTSIDE ARE WORTHLESS you cant see your screen if you are in any light what so ever	-1
the product works great if you like to look at yourself . but visibility is very poor in most situations .	-1
didnt fit my iphone cheaply made but they came very fast iwas very suprise at how fast i got them but didnt fit	-1
these are nearly impossible to put on without getting bubbles from dust ... . I went through all 5 before i gave up completely .	-1
This product is slighhhhhtly bigger than the iPhone screen , big enough to leave bubbles at an edge no matter how it is aligned . I spent some time to try to fit it and gave up after the second sheet to decide to throw away the whole package.Do n't bother to buy it .	-1
Do n't waste your time on this product . The backing will not peel off , so you ca n't use them . The screen protector appears to be very thin , but I could n't tell for sure b/c I could n't actually get to the protector in order to apply it to my phone . There is a little tab on the side to help you peel it , but it simply would n't separate the backing from the screen protector -- I returned these as defective even though it 's not much money -- It 's the principle of the thing . Cheap , shoddy stuff .	-1
Another gentleman who gave this product one star said it all for me . The product has a tab to help you put the protector on the phone ... the tab does not come off completely so you are left with some sort of ugly goo that will not scratch or smear off . There is no way to get all the bubbles out and my package did not come with a card to help me remove the bubbles . I used 3 of the 5 screens so far and they all look horrible . Not sure why others gave it more than one star .	-1
receive very fast , they where where very cheap , however i have not use them yet.. I hope that they will be easy to install onto the phone .	-1
There 's a reason why this is so cheap - i should have guessed , but until i find a better one , it will have to do . The seller is probably trying to get rid of inventory at a loss.- The size is off ; it does n't cover the glass entirely - it 's too narrow and too long . When it comes to protectors , being off even a half a mm is a pain . That 's why even if you know how to put these on , you 're gon na go through a few to make the adjustment for wrong sizing . I went through two.- The plastic is super cheap so your fingers will not glide on it . Which means they get sticky , like if there 's some kind of glue on it . That also means that you 're not gon na be able to get all the bubbles out . I still have two small bubbles i ca n't push out from underneath.- And this is probably the biggest problem - the plastic film is so cheap that it has a rainbow effect ; if you look at it from most angles , you will see the rainbow unevenness going across horizontally . It 's like what you see when you mix water and gasoline . It 's very annoying.Save yourself the trouble and disappointment - do n't buy this product .	-1
Very terrible protection too glossy and it bubbles ridiculously its horrible . Came in a pack of five went through all of the them in 2 days . Sucks	-1
Horrible quality , get what you pay for . Reminds me of the plastic that comes on a fruit roll up . I will never buy these again , I bought something else that was shipped together and thought it was free ones that they sent as a compliment .	-1
I applied the first one to my phone and the left and right edges about .25 '' on both sides just will not adhere . I put one on my wife 's phone and the same thing . I took mine off , started fresh , even cleaned the screen with rubbing alcohol and put on gloves ... same problem .	-1
These are a waste of money to me because they put this white paper tab on them and once you put it on your phone you ca n't get the stupid tabs off them .	-1
These `` protectors '' love smudges and the oil from your fingers . They do protect the screen , but were a major disappointment . Look elsewhere .	-1
It 's OK.. Have seen better though . Probably would n't buy again . Not would not recommend these screen protectors but the cloth lint is great for cleaning your reading glasses after you have used up the 5 screen protectors in about 5 weeks !	-1
I used three of these . I had to trim them a bit , they were difficult to install , and I did not end up using them very long because they ended up making my phone look kinda junky . They offered some amount of protection , but they seemed to scratch up quite easily whereas the 3GS glass was quite scratch resistant on its own . Since these would not in any way protecting your screen from breaking , I decided that it was n't worth having them on as they only made my phone look a bit crap .	-1
really hard to put on phone , blew thru 3 of them before I got one right . I would not try them again	-1
They left a lot of bubbles after applying . I spent a good amount of time trying to work them out but still some remain . And I as I was writing this my 16 month old daughter pulled it off the phone sooo they are n't that sticky either . I 'll be throwing them out . Waste of money . Do n't buy .	-1
All five protectors were bent and would not adhere to the iPhone on the edges . Poor quality . I 'd rate this zero stars if that were allowed .	-1
It took forever to receive these since they come from China . Also , it is almost impossible to install these without getting a speck of dust or an air bubble under it . Then it looks like crap . Just buy a good case .	-1
I did not like this product . Very difficult to apply to screen . Air bubbles are terrible to get off the screen .	-1
Bought these fo my iphone but they didnt work to great . Came off my phone in just a few days . Not a good value .	-1
These screen protectors came as part of a combo purchase recommended by Amazon . I ordered a charge/sync cord and wall charger for my iPhone and the best price available included these screen protectors . I needed to replace the one on my phone as it had a scratch , nothing minor so I had been putting it off . When these arrived I pulled off my old protector , cleaned the screen on my phone very carefully and started to put on the first one . It apparently came with dust already attached to the sticky side so I ended up with a small bubble under the protector . I also noticed that it had a very noticeable kind of swirly rainbow look to it under the lights in my office . I decided that since I got five of these I would try again . I managed to get it on a bit crooked on my first try and discovered the rainbow effect again . Since I had three left I decided to give it one last try . I got it on straight this time but once again ended up with a piece of dust on the underside of the protector and the rainbow effect was still there.Do n't waste your money on these . I threw the last two away .	-1
I bought iPhone 3GS for my family member few weeks back and to protect the screen I decided to buy a cheap and good screen protector . I read some nice reviews about this product and decided to give a try for $ 1.00 . They delivered 5 pack of screen protector ( Good thing ) but unfortunately none of them worked so well . All my 5 front side screen protector are went bad . Some of them gave me bubbles , some came off right away after sticking on the screen for 3 minutes . Very cheap material . If you even try to put on screen protector very accurately by following their methods and procedures then also it will leave some bubbles . Putting on screen protector you will get some scratch . For me it was a bad purchase . I would definitely not going to recommend this to anyone . Pay little bit extra and get good quality and durable screen protector .	-1
They did not work for me that we 'll , I would n't really buy more of these , they even feel like bad material .	-1
It did n't work even after I charged it 24 hours . I tried many ways and nothing . It was only included headset and wall charger . No instruction manual included . I have returned it to seller with my own expense shipping charge . I am waiting for the full refund from the seller for they said so .	-1
This device did not perform at all as well as I expected from a Plantronics product . The range is very poor , and the noise level is completely unacceptable , even inside in quiet environments . Outside in even mildly breezy conditions it is unusable . I will be returning it and replacing it with another Discovery 925 that I lost a couple of weeks ago .	-1
I just bought this piece of junk . I did n't use it the first night . I then charged it up overnight and used it . Seemed to work okay , but had some interference , probably from the WiFi hub I have about 10 feet away.When I let it charge overnight ( like I charged it initially ) , I woke up and found the red `` charging '' indicator was out . Good . Fully charged . Then I tried to turn it on . Nothing . Dead . Nada . `` Okay , I 'll just plug it back in '' Maybe 2-3 minutes later , the charging light stops . Let 's try turning it on again . Nothing . Dead . Nada.Had I been ripped off ? I doubted it . I 've had a lot more problems with eBay than Amazon , which is why I switched . Being the problem solver I am , I searched `` Plantronics 220 wo n't turn on . '' The best advice I got from NON-PLANTRONICS people ( AKA other costumers ) was to take the cover off and short the battery . I did n't want to muck around THAT much , so I called Plantronics `` customer service . '' I called after hours and the system referred me to Plantronics.com . Thanks for nothing.Got up today and called again , business hours . THEY STILL REFERRED ME TO PLANTRONICS.COM AFTER 2 PROMPTS . Great people , right ? So I went ahead and pried open the cover , which is easier said than done , and shorted the battery for a little while . Pressed the `` let 's make this do everything '' button , and it turned on . SAVED ! HALLELUJAH ! Still worked with my phone . Then a couple minutes later , it died . Now I 'm back to the troubling task of charging the stupid thing up . Will I have to pry it open again ? Hopefully not.TL ; DR ? Do n't buy Plantronics . Never again ... 2 stars because it worked for a while .	-1
The Plantronics 220 just doesnt work . It pairs , it connects , and it gives you a static filled connection even when holding the phone in your hand more than two feet away . Just garbage . The plantonics Voyager 510 - now THATS a headset -- can leave a phone thirty feet away and it goes through two walls in that distance . The 220- garbage . Also , beware buying so called Motorola bluetooth earpieces on a 'bay auction site . They are mostly counterfeit and work just as poorly as a real Plantronics 220 .	-1
so just wanted to up date my last review . I still have n't recieved my order apprently lost in mail and company said on may 20 they would resend order . so three day now and no shipping info but will see	-1
I only text and do email - no music or surfing and the battery just does not last . Frankly the original was not good either but much better than this .	-1
DOES NOT WORK ! DO NOT BUY STUFF FROM Sold by : The OEM ShopTHEY MAILED ME 2 DIFFERENT CABLE AND BOTH DAMAGE !	-1
It 's not that great , it usually charges when it wants to . Sometimes it will synch and charge and other times it will say that it 's not supported .	-1
As with many third-party cables , it just does n't fit the phone as well as the original . The one I got feels `` gritty '' when attaching it , like it 's grinding on the connectors when it should n't be . I should have known better.Update : As expected , it broke under normal usage in less than 1 month . AVOID .	-1
this is not good.this product never worked as advertised.When i plug into computer I get this warning on Iphone and I quote . `` this device is not supported by Iphone '' So i thought Hmm maybe they are not telling the truth ( IPHONE ) so i left it hooked up for 6 hours and it did not charge 1 % .the company contacted me after last negative review i gave on this product . They sent me another . this is a review of the second one.I will give these to any one who wants them . Opps first one is in trash . I have no use for a product that does n't do what it was advertised to do .	-1
Cable went bad after a month but being that it was only $ 3 bucks I guess I cant complain . Spend the extra $ $ and buy an original .	-1
Not sure if it was the blackberry or the battery itself , but this did not last very long . I since got a new phone so I dont have that problem anymore .	-1
HURTS THE EAR , WHERE IT HAS A CORNER ON THE BACK SIDE THAT PRESSES INTO THE EAR AND STARTS TO HURT , THE SOUND IS OK BUT NOT THE BEST , WONT GET LOUD ENOFF .	-1
Although the most comfortable headset I have EVER worn , NO ONE could hear me unless it was angles juuuuust right on my face . And worst of all , unless the phone is about 2 ft away from the headset , it will not stay connected . I either had to hold the phone or place in my shirt pocket . I returned it after 1 week.I DO NOT recommend this headset .	-1
As the Sound 20 is no longer a current model , the price has dropped significantly -- I paid around $ 20 for mine . At that price it is a good bargain for anyone who wants a plain vanilla headset with decent sound quality . I find that the sound itself is excellent -- far superior to any other bluetooth headset I 've used . The device is simple and thus easy to use , and the design is a notch better than most of the devices out there . As for fit , the device sits in your ear rather than over it , though there is an optional ear loop . I find that it nestles comfortably in my ear so that I do n't notice it 's there . The downsides are that because it 's not a current model there are a number of things it ca n't do , and in addition I find that the range is not that great -- sound degrades rapidly once the earpiece is not in a direct line with the phone or other device.The device has one multicolored LED which is difficult to see if you are not looking directly at it . Mine came in the original packaging with additional ear pieces and was black not blue so I ca n't comment on the color . If you just need a headset ( earpiece ) for calls ( no music ) and can live without voice recognition , this can be a good buy.Update and why I changed this review from three to one star : Product was ok while it worked but item 's internal battery stopped holding a charge after less than a year . Even though it is moderately inexpensive , that 's substandard performance in my opinion since the item is worthless once it ca n't hold a charge .	-1
It looks sleek and gets a lot of good reviews , but in my experience , it has not performed to expectation ( not that I have particularly high standards ) . My chief complaints:1 ) the little rubber ear pieces that are supposed to hold it in your ear make for a good fit . BUT they incessantly break , forcing you to buy and replace them constantly.2 ) it is supposed to offer simplified use with only 2 buttons . BUT it requires you to figure out which combination of buttons to press , how long to hold it , when to let go and what to do next . It makes it surprisingly difficult to use . For example , I want to pair it with the phone but end up turning it off instead . ( Does anyone else have this problem or am I just incompetent ? ) 3 ) minor annoyance , but often times , it is difficult to tell if it is on or off . So often times , I think its off and I try to turn it on , just to find out that I just turned it off . The different colors on the light are supposed to indicate its current on/off state , but I just never seem to have good luck with it . ( Again , may be it is just my incompetence ? ) However , there are some nice aspects : it looks sleek and is compact , fitting nicely in the ear . Battery life seems to be ok as well . I never found much use for the dual microphone noise reduction capability . People on the phone always told me that they could hear no difference when I used it.As a result of the challenges I found with it , I rarely find myself using it anymore . So the long and the short of it is that I am not very satisfied , certainly not at the price . My personal opinion is that it does not offer good value , considering how much you are forking out on it.I used the Plantronics Voyager 510 before and was quite satisfied with it before I lost it . Yes , it was a little bit large , but very usable , long battery life , etc . And it is less than half the price of this one . Based on my experience , I would recommend that one.Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [ Retail Packaging ]	-1
GOOD MAILING TIME , CAME IN USED , I COULD SEE THE DENTS AND SCRACTHES ON THIS BATTERY , NOT IN PACKAGING , IN A PLASTIC COVER , IT IS NOT NEW , USED OR JUST IN BAD SHAPE BUT AND I SAY BUT IT IS WORKING VERY WELL .	-1
I got this from ACC Stop at the end of May . It was for my daughter so she can stay connected . She probably charged the phone maybe 6 times since she does n't use it much . It died while on vacation and never accepted a charge back up . Bad Battery .	-1
Very light duty only ; if you have a device that requires a 1 Amp adapter , then get a better cable . This will work for a short time only . It should always be fine as a data cable , but not as a charger .	-1
When I searched for a Samsung galaxy s3 charger this product popped up . When I received it in the mail it did not even fit my phone .	-1
I ordered it thinking that this was a Samsung cable but when it arrived I was really disappointed , not only was it not as long as the original but it was very poorly made . The quality was very poor and the shipping took incredibly long . It works just fine , but feels cheap and is cheap , I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
These cables are great for stuffing into a bag , or using at home or in the car . They 're not too stiff , and the cables are thin enough to avoid being bulky . ** update **After some strange charging issues over the last few months , I 've determined that these cables can carry data but little to no charge , regardless of whether the power is coming from a battery pack , wall wart , car charger , single USB port , or Y-cabled double USB port.On the other hand , it 's strong and flexible enough to tie a door open .	-1
These cables do not look like the PRIMARY picture . They are extremely short and have the big head to it . I did not look at every picture , so in the end it was my fault . Alternatively , I should n't have to look at every picture when the primary picture is a complete false advertisement of what it looks like.The cord also falls out of my phone VERY easily . Do n't bump it.I would end up losing money to return this , so I 'm stuck with it . The best advice I can give is spend a little more money and get one that actually looks like what they falsely lead you to believe it SHOULD look like.The shipping took over 2 weeks as well . And you can NOT track your items with this company . After emailing them , I just got an email back saying , `` it should be there by the end of the week , but there is no way for us to know when '' . 2 weeks is not 3 - 5 business days .	-1
I bought this to use to charge my cell phone , plugged it in and left it overnight . The next morning , it said fully charged , unplugged it and it was not charged even a bit ... It may work for some , it did n't work for me !	-1
This cable does not work with Galaxy S4 . It is clearly not Samsung OEM ( which is obvious from the price ) but it does not work at all which makes it a piece of garbage .	-1
Cable did n't work when I got it - pinching the correct spot on the phone end seemed to make it work , but it was obviously internally defective.Seller immediately refunded me .	-1
How hard is it to make a charging cable ? I bought two of these for my Galaxy Nexus and my Nexus 7 , they do n't work . I tried them in a car charger and in an AC charger ( both of which work extremely well with other cables ) . In the car charger I got nothing , in the AC charger one would work at AC if you wiggled it enough , if not it did nothing . The other worked as USB instead of as AC . I got the same results with both the Galaxy Nexus and the Nexus 7 . Absolute junk , stay away .	-1
Came much shorter than I expected but it still did the job . Just do n't expect this to stretch very far	-1
I sent for charging cords from three different places hoping that one would work for my Samsung SII phone . This one did not charge at all . The one I ordered from Wireless Hub , Brooklyn , NY worked immediately .	-1
Says its arrived but , I have not got it yet , I will update this once it comes in and I can use it on my phone .	-1
worked pretty good for a while until recently few weeks ago kept getting more loose when plugged into phone then just would n't charge anymore after some significant jiggling around . oh well , not bad for a $ 2.50 purchase . the other imitation i bought with the more straight ahead plug not the slanted to the side like this one actually fit better and still charging strong !	-1
Stopped working after just a few week . You get what you pay for . At least I am only out a few dollars .	-1
The picture for on this product listing is innacurate as I did not get a Samsung replacement cable but a cheap generic one . Ca n't complain too much its only a buck and change , but this is just to let people know the picture is not what you will get .	-1
I bought these two of these cables looking to replace damaged Samsung ones that I had laying around . I needed them for data cables and charging of my GS3 . When I got them , much faster than I expected , I was pretty happy at first , till I used them.They are n't the style in the photo nor are they replacement cables for Samsung . They take about a minute to register with the computer that the phone is plugged in ( upwards of 2 minutes ) , and when connected , they do n't allow sync to occur.When used as chargers ( plugged in to USB outlet adapters ) , they take over 10 hours to get a dead battery to 80 % ! I though it could be the charger , so tried different ones . Also tried other devices ( a Mifi , my GS3 , a cheap Samsung flip phone ) , all with similar results : Mifi - from dead to 77 % after 8 hours ; GS3 - 10 % to 60 % after 7 hours ; basic flip phone : dead to 75 % after 8 hours.I also tried the other cable and repeated my tests : same results.I 'll keep these to keep the charge ( it 'll keep my GS3 at it 's current level for hours , as long as it 's not under heavy usage ) , but I 'm looking for better ones after this .	-1
you get what you pay for . looks similar to actual cable . broke within 1 day of use . wires showing thru cable . buy better quality cable .	-1
I bought this cable a few months ago and it worked fine until I dropped my phone about 2 feet off my lap on to the floor while my charging cable was plugged in.It unfortunately landed on its end pinching the micro end of the cable causing it to split the plastic at the connector point causing complete failure of the cable.The plastic was very cheap and molding weak.I am going to try buying a better brand .	-1
These do not work in my ZTE Warp or my Samsung Preval . I order ( 6 ) of them now I 'm stuck with them shame on me !	-1
Right after getting this , the plastic around the phone connector broke , exposing the wires . It still charges , but it slides out too easily . That said , I still use it . it works , just real shoddy build .	-1
Cable is hardly a foot long . I ca n't even connect it to my computer 's USB ports and leave my phone on my desk it 's so short . Real samsung cable is well over a meter long , almost 2 meters . This is less than 2 feet .	-1
I only had this a few weeks before it broke ! It 's really hard to find a cheap quality replacement USB cable . This was NOT the one .	-1
CHEAP ! And flimsy ! Not worth even the low price , waste of money . Lasted maybe a week . Not even worth returning .	-1
Appears to be Samsung from the labeling , but only ~30 '' long . Barely enough for a computer to charge/mount/ADB , but too short for a Mini Cooper to get from the CLA-to-USB to the dash . Too short to be able to plug into your computer and hold the phone.Definitely shorter than illustrated on the Samsung site . Definitely a different micro-USB plug than current OEM -- current ones have a small + and - on the back.These are going back to Amazon ( purchased from Amazon themselves ) .Samsung 5 ' cable as shipped with T959V is ECC1DU2BBEUsing my `` left over '' Nokia cables which are a foot longer and a better length -- USB CA101 Connectivity CableorNew OEM Nokia 5310 8600 Luna N81 Micro USB Cable CA-101	-1
I received this cable and immediately noted that it not only deviated from what is pictured but that it was obviously a cheap , fake cable . I used it for a while although it unfortunately necessitates removing my SGS3 from its Speck case . Today I discovered that after only a few months of very occasional use , it has stopped transmitting data at all . So I am back to using the original cable that came with my phone.Do yourself a favor , pay a little bit more , and buy a quality Motorola or other branded cable .	-1
the one I received almost seemed like it was used instead of brand new . went bad really quickly , so I 'd recommend if you want a good replacement cable , just go to a store that will have less hassle to return it if it goes bad	-1
Bad Samsung imitation . Does not work . The cable get loose on connection and it does n't work . I though I have a deal but this time failed .	-1
I constantly charge my phone , so any cable is going to get a lot of use as I plug/unplug at least 5 times a day . With that said , I still think a cable should last more than a few months . I purchased several of these , and all have gone bad . The problem is with the micro USB section . The prongs that make the connection start to fail by not sticking up as much as they should . When the problem first starts , I have to wiggle the cord to make a connection . It continues to get worse so that I have to wrap the cord around the phone and do other things to make sure it is plugged in at a certain angle . Finally , it gets so bad that I have to throw out the cable . New cables fix the problem - it 's not my phone .	-1
When I plug this cord into my phone for the first time I had to wiggle it around to get it to make a connection . I have 3 other chargers that I do n't have to wiggle to get to work . That 's how my old one did before it stopped working entirely . That 's why I bought this cord.Think it may have a faulty wire ?	-1
This cable dont work ... im so dissapointed , this cable is junk , can not believe they sent me a cable that doesnt work , what a waste of my money and time ! ! ! ! ! ! Ahhhhhhrrrr s***	-1
Horrible . Did not stretch long at all . If I wanted to plug in my phone to the wall , it would have to sit on the floor . Plug was a USB but only worked in one phone .	-1
i have an app that shows the actual charging rate . my original cord from samsung charges at 1 amp , but this cord plugged into the same charging block only charges at 400 milli amps . My factory cord charges 2 1/2 times faster . you get what you pay for .	-1
Be aware of this product.It 's not real Samsung product . I ordered 4 cables and every serial numbers are the same.It 's a really faked one and may break your phone.The pin is too tight and if you use this too long time , your phone 's usb jack would not fit to any other genuine Samsung USB cable.Shame on Hongkong ! I 'm going to claim now ! Update 5/4/12 : Got an email from seller and they refunded full amount but I keep the one star review because of faked one ( useless ) .	-1
I bought these after seeing them for $ 9.99 at a local store- They work great , I use for my Samsung Galaxy S 4G phone and a Comet phone.. No complaints , they work great , and awesome price ! ** Updated review * I bought these again 5/13- I have a note II and it takes along time to charge.. These are n't Samsung and seem bigger than the Samsung version- Have to be-careful they WILL rip your charging port out.. Wo n't order again..The second group two years later was generic.. Buyers beware for a newer Samsung Phone ...	-1
I got it to replace my charger cable but thos cable is a waste of money , in order to charge my phone it has to be at a certain angle , I tried it in my wife 's phone and it has to be wiggle to find the right angle in witch it will charge the phone . If you are smart spend a little more and get a better cable .	-1
I bough a single cable and it did not work at all . The price was so cheap that I went ahead and ordered two more . They worked perfectly . Guess this does n't make your decision easier huh ?	-1
Bought a pair of these cables and they took almost 3 weeks to arrive which was expected so issues there . The first arrived DOA , never worked . The second died shortly after less than a week of use . Both cables are very short and barely reach anywhere . They had to be forced inside the phone connector which made me cringe every time . If you are looking for a charging cable , look elsewhere , even for under two dollars , these cables are simply not worth it .	-1
It failed after approximately six months of use . I would not buy this again in the future . i would come off better purchasing one at the store .	-1
The good : it 's a micro USB cableThe bad : it 's not what 's pictured . Not Samsung type small profile plug , but larger connector that is hard to fit into some phones - particularly if the phone has a protective case .	-1
Like others have said in their reviews , this cable does not seem well-made at all . I have tried to use it over the past several weeks . Sometimes it charges and sometimes it does n't -- when it does , it charges VERY slowly -- like 4 hours to go from 40 % to 100 % . Half the time , the computer does n't even recognize that my phone has been plugged in . I do not recommend this product .	-1
this equipment is obviously not a samsung product . it takes bare minimum 2 hours ( uninterrupted ) charging time to get a full charge with this cable and even then the batter dies quicker than usual . I would not recommend this product to anyone else . I purchased 2 of them and they are both horrible	-1
Cords looked good when I got them . Decent quality , especially for what I paid . I then used them to connect my Galaxy S4 to my computer . Phone said it was charging but computer was never able to connect . No big deal since I figured I 'd just use these with my usb plugs next to my bed and whatnot . Woke up the next morning and my phones battery percentage had actually gone down ! I figured I messed up and accidentally turned the power strip off or something . That was n't the case but maybe I did n't plug it into my phone good enough . I decided to take one to work to keep there and after plugging it in to many things with none of them working I connected my S4 to my computer and took note of the time and battery percentage . In one hour my battery went up only 2 % ! ! What the what ! After giving these cords the benefit of the doubt time and time again I finally found the best place for them , the trash can . Thanks for nothing .	-1
Despite the description and the pictures of a `` Samsung '' USB Data Cable , what I received was a generic Micro USB cable that bears no resemblance whatsoever to what was pictured on line . I would not have purchased this if I had known that I would receive a cheap generic substitute instead .	-1
These actually discharged my Samsung Note 2 . I bought 3 and none of them worked . I have n't checked to see if I can access pictures and music on the phone yet , but at this point it is meaningless . I have to buy more cords to charge .	-1
This is a completely re-written review . This cable works on all my devices except for the Google Nexus 4 . I bought three of these cables , and none of them work on my Nexus 4 . However , these cables seem to charge and transfer data for Nexus 7 , Motorola Droid 4 , & Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 . When I connect the cable to my Nexus 4 , the phone would sporadically charge and disconnect every few seconds.Do not buy this if you are concerned that your device is incompatible with the cable .	-1
Cables do n't even charge the phones . You can tell they are n't official because the micro-USB end has a thicker plastic than the official samsung cables . I bought from a seller named Touch Global . ended up shipping from Pakistan or somewhere , cant bother to return it I 'll just count it as a loss and pay more for proper quality next time .	-1
Maybe I did n't read the description thouroughly enough but this cord sure didnt work for the Samsung Precedent phone from the prepaid/pay-as-you-go plans . I was disappointed but was only out a couple bucks ...	-1
This charger broek within two days of getting and no help on returning it for it being falty . WOULD NOT RECOMEND	-1
The seller Amamax is shipping a junk 3 foot generic charging cable . This cable will break within a week . The micro USB end will let loose from the insulation and render the cable useless almost immediately . Others have had good luck with OEM products , but Amamax does not ship OEM products , and they take a week to ship it ...	-1
I bought these to charge my Nexus devices ( 4 and 7 ) , but they do not maintain a constant connection . I plugged in my Nexus 4 using these cables , and the charging notification flickers , suggesting that it was constantly losing connection and reconnecting . This does n't happen with other micro usb cables that I 've used .	-1
This charger will charge your phone.. as long as you do n't try to use it at all while it 's charging . If you try to simultaneously charge and use the phone.. the phone 's power usage is much more than this charger 's ability to charge . The stock cable that I received with my phone is able to charge while I 'm using the phone . I 'm not sure why this one is so weak..	-1
This is a fake . If you can even get the phone to recognize the cord , it takes something like 12 to 16 hours to fully charge . Absolutely not acceptable .	-1
They do n't tell you how long this cord is . The one I got was about 8 inches long . That was a little less than expected . I guess it works , but I did n't know that they made them that short .	-1
Again , this product description says OEM by Samsung ... data cable ... I can not get it to work unless I `` giggle '' the connection to the phone . I 've tried it on other phones and get the same problem . I give up trying to find a mini usb cable that will connect properly to a Samsung phone .	-1
It came by the date that is the only good thing I can about it . It is short but that is n't the worst problem ! It does n't stay in my phone . It takes my phone forever to charge . If I 'm on it and its on the charger it makes the percent go down instead of up	-1
Brought 3 of these to have around the house . First one worked fine for about 3 months and then failed ( no charge , no data ) . Switched charger and still no charge . Tried using the other two ( both still in original packaging ) . Both did n't worked . Would not transfer data or charge my phone battery . Put the original phone charge cable into the charger and it worked fine so I knew it was the cable and not the charger . To make sure , I tried several other chargers . Nothing . Threw all three out . A total waste of money . It 's been over 3 months so could not return the order . Will not buy this again . Would give it zero star if possible . Very disappointed .	-1
My husbands Samsung Stratosphere 2 will only charge on authentic Samsung chargers and cables . It does not recognize this as a Samsung product .	-1
Seriously , why do n't they just make it last . I am pretty sure I went through two if not three of these . I thought I made a great find for a replacement cable for my GS2 . But I threw both away . They would not connect well or be loose so it would n't charge . I had the hardest time finding the right cable . Ironically I found an amazing short and super long one that work awesome . The short Nokia CA-101D 8-inch Connectivity Cable for Nokia ( search that on amazon ) It connects well and is very solid . Should also work for GS3 but that I do n't own . Then the long Mediabridge High Speed USB 2.0 A-Male to Micro-B Cable - 6 feet ( also amazon ) that is amazing quality , just increadibly long ! But good luck searching . Hopefully those two suggestions will help you find your answer . I have been through 4 or 5 different micro USB chargers and those two just mentioned have been the best ! ! ! ! !	-1
Bad quality , short , thin and breakable . I recommend buying a blue rigger 6ft usb cable . Its cheaper and much much better quality . Do n't waste your money on this .	-1
It 's even worse when my phone is in my pocket and I bend over , but the sound will ( sometimes ) cut out every second or two while I 'm holding the phone 18 '' away . Checking with Motorola about warranty , but really disappointing .	-1
I originally bought the S9 's , which sounded O.K. , but failed after one 30 minute workout with moderate sweating . I said in a review of those that I was going to try the Jaybird 's , but I liked the S9 's so much that I decided to try the S9 HD 's instead . I had read that the S9 HD 's were much improved in sweat resistance . Not true.On the positive , I will say there is no comparison between the S9 's and the S9 HD 's as far as sound quality . The HD 's simply blow the older model away . I was very happy with them initially , although I was so paranoid after my earlier short lived experience , that I found myself CONSTANTLY wiping the headphones off to make sure they did n't get wet while working out . Well , even that did n't work . Sadly after only 3 workouts , these too have failed . This time the headphones themselves still function , as well as the volume controls , however the pause , phone , and forward/back controls have all failed . Sigh ... I really do want to like these headphones , but they are obviously not an appropriate product if you want to use them for workouts . At least they had the decency to fail within the 30 day return period ! This time I actually did order the Jaybirds instead . I know they do n't have the same audio quality as these do , but hopefully they will function for over a week ! UPDATE : I looked at my review this morning , and decided that I was too harsh in rating these 1 star ( although I ca n't go back and change that ) . They really are very good as far as sound quality , and if you are n't using them for workouts , then you will probably really like them . It 's just the only time I ever use headphones is during workouts , so for me at least they are unacceptable .	-1
I decided to totally rewrite this review . I finally started using these again hoping I could cope with the worst bluetooth range I have ever seen to date , and sorry , I ca n't take it.Pros : The sound quality is great . It 's some of the best I 've ever had for Bluetooth Headphones.I have n't had sweat problems at the gym like other people seem to have had.They are very lightweight , although it would be nicer if it was lower so you could lay down with them on.Cons : The rubber glue holding the power button rubber unglued itself.The battery life is about 5 hours ... not bad for the size , but not really that great either.Motorola technical support is some of the worst ever conceived , it 's a joke to even call it that.They bend pretty easy - if you take these on a road trip , make sure they do n't have /any/ weight on them . Mine bent to the left pretty heavy and took some time to bend back.But the real meat and potatoes is that THESE HAVE THE WORST WIRELESS RANGE IN THE HISTORY OF WIRELESS.I have to put my phone in my hood to get the sound to not cut out nonstop . Pockets ? Sorry , you are SOL . Like working out ? It works , kind of . Biking with your phone in your pocket is a long lost dream . I did n't buy these - My HT820 ( which by the way was AMAZING compared to these ) went in for warranty , and they sent me these back . No charger , no manual , nothing but these in a box ( and they were n't even bubble wrapped ! ) and then when I contacted them about it , they said my warranty had expired . That might be due to the fact that it TOOK NEARLY 3 WEEKS to get a response . Getting an RMA on my previous set so bad that I am never buying Motorola again.Overall , I really dislike these headphones because there is no practical use . Look at the 1 star reviews , and you 'll see what I have.I can not repeat this enough : DO NOT BUY THESE , SAVE YOURSELF THE HORRORS OF THIS PIECE OF TRASH ( for lack of better words ) Update : I have upgraded to the Nokia BH-905i - I like BT headphones and I 'm not going to throw my money away on another pair of these losers . The sound does n't cut out on my ( new ) phone with the new pair - it still does with the old ( these ) . When I did upgrade my phone ( from when I wrote the top part of this review ) , I tested out the BT range , and sadly , the problem did lie in these headphones . I want to like them , but with all of the problems , there is nothing about these to like .	-1
This is the first bluetooth headset that I bought . The first few days it worked ok but I noticed I had to recharge it after every couple of hours that was used . Then I started hearing a lot of static noice ( I was not walking around , sitting next to my laptop ) . Bottom line , do n't waste your money , there is a reason this headset was so cheap . Who knows maybe a more expensive one does a better job .	-1
Actually no it kept turning off and on and i dont know the reason so yea it didnt work it was a really very bad one ! Sorry	-1
Have bought from this same product link 6 months ago , and that one was OK . This latest purchase , however , only lasted about 3 weeks , and now it does not hold a charge , drops rapidly to zero after a couple of hours . Again , the one from six months ago is fine on the same phone .	-1
I recently ordered a new battery from another seller for my friends G1 which was no longer holding a charge . The battery worked better than expected . My G1 battery began to die quickly even with limited use so I figured I 'd get a new battery for mine as well . This battery did not work as well as the other I ordered . This battery seems to work just as bad as the original one I 've had for a few years.When I received it , it had about 70 % life and I decided to fully charge it and then let it completely die before recharging . I 've been using it for a few days and I charge it fully each night . By the end of the day , which is around 5 or 6pm for me , it 's down to less than 20 % . I rarely use my phone during the day while I 'm at work . I even tried taking off the autosync feature to save battery life . Last night as usual I fully charged the battery . I 've checked my email and received/sent a few text messages . It 's now noon and the battery is at 44 % ! I believe there are some lower priced batteries out there that actually work . I do n't think this is one of them . Try at your own risk . I 'm just thankful I did n't spend alot on this .	-1
If you want this phone because of the supposed IMAP client , you might be disappointed . There are other problems too , but I 'll start with the long one.If you have it already , and set up your email by following all of the menu prompts , you might like it just fine without realizing what it is actually doing.The way life ought to work , and does on other phones : If you have an IMAP email phone , and an email service which supports IMAP , you get free `` push '' email ( instant delivery , not waiting for the next dial-up ) with no extra charge beyond your data plan . Very simple.Nokia does n't seem to care . There is an option for email alerts , but it does n't seem to actually work unless you agree to the terms of their new `` Nokia Messaging '' service . Instead of the phone connecting directly with your email provider ( eg , GMail ) , the phone installs the Nokia application which connects with Nokia 's server , and that server at Nokia is actually connected with your email provider . Not only is this a ghetto work-around , but if you read the terms of the service , it is only free until Nokia decides they are done `` testing '' it and want to charge you money.So you might be happily using what you think is IMAP push email on this phone , and for all we know it could stop working next month and Nokia could demand that you pay their subscription fee ... for something which ought to just work anyway.No pretend that this does n't matter to you , or you think I am nuts , etc . On to the next problem.If your email provider has IMAP available , the phone will not allow you to set it to download whole email messages . The setting option which allows either `` headers only '' or header+body when you use POP3 is neutered when you have an IMAP server address , and the only option is headers only . So if you look at your phone and see several new emails , every time you click on it you have to wait for it to connect and load the email . My SonyEricsson w595 is not so stupid . I have instant IMAP delivery , and get the body text automatically.So forget about the email client , what about other Internet applications ? Here 's two problems with that stuff:1 . You ca n't turn off the menu option which stupidly asks if you really want to allow a web browser to access the Internet ... every single time you use it . Other phones at least skip this if you installed a signed application ( eg , Opera or Bolt browsers ) . The popup has no `` never ask '' option , and there is no setting for it from the application manager either . Only Nokia 's own browser is exempt.2 . The fancy e63 also lets you select an `` access point '' every time you do something which requires Internet access . This would be a great feature if you use both WiFi and cellular , and want to switch back and forth all the time . But it 's a total annoyance if you do n't . The e63 lets you turn this `` feature '' off for its own web browser , but it still does it for everything else . Google maps , Bolt browser , GMail application ... every one makes you select the access point every time you use it .	-1
i ordered the phone few days ago and it arrived today . initially i was so excited that i got the package so fast even though i took advantage of using the free shipping . but soon : my excitement turned into suspicion , then surprise and finally angry : ( suspicion ) the box felted a bit light ( surprise ) the seal on the box was broken ( ANGRY ) NO PHONE INSIDE THE BOX ! ! ! it has the manual and the wall charger but the phone . this is ridiculous , not even the April Fools ' day yet ! i contacted Amazon immediately and another phone is on its way to my door . i have purchased countless items from Amazon , new or used , but NEVER received empty box . i appreciate Amazon 's effort in resolving this problem quickly , but still it looks Amazon is getting too comfortable being the # 1 e-retailer for too long , WAKE UP , AMAZON.COM !	-1
I ordered a pair of these . One lasted a single charge , the second did n't work at all . If I could have given this product zero stars , I would have . Not worth the postage to return - kept the removable usb cables , and threw the adapters away .	-1
I used this charger for about 6 months , pretty sporadically , with my Droid X & Sansa Clip+ as the two primary recipients of recharges straight from the wall outlet as opposed to a computer 's USB port . Everything worked fine , except I 'd notice the units were slightly warmer to the touch than if they were charging from the computer , or in the case of the Droid X , from the Motorola shipped wall-to-USB charger.A few weeks ago , I left my Sansa plugged in for a few hours for a full charge ( usually takes about 3-4 hrs to charge from empty ) . When I came back , it was completely dead , and very warm to the touch . I smelled something that could 've been burnt wires , but could 've just been the plastic -- very hard to tell . All attempts to restart the Sansa failed , and I RMA'ed it . I 've since stopped using this adapter for any of my electronic devices.I ca n't blame the charger for the Sansa 's death with 100 % certainty so I 'm giving it 2* instead of 1* , but considering I do n't feel comfortable using it ever again , I 'm not going to give it any higher rating . User beware , I guess .	-1
I do n't recall purchasing this product . I no longer have the item , so I assume it no longer works . I will give it 2 stars for this ... .	-1
I bought it after reading other good review about it . Well , it is good quality . However , it is too thick and stay loose with my phone . What is the point to have a good quality cover but it is not sit tie to your phone so that you can not use it ? Well , I ca n't use it , but it is too cheap to return , so I just threw it away . Not recommend it .	-1
I tried this one after striking out on a solar powered speaker system . While this one performs better than the prior , it still does n't pull it 's weight for the money . I will be sending this one back as well .	-1
New out of the box and the speaker pops and snaps and crackles with every beat of the song . Too bad I was playing a violin sonata by Debussy . When I listen to a song I want to hear the music not the hiss of poor received signal or the rattle of loose and broken parts.I knew that at the low price of the speaker that I should not expect much but I did not expect for the speaker to be of such poor quality.PRO : Bluetooth connectivity worked . Came with batteries.CONS : Loud beeps every time a button is pressed . Speaker is unusable due to all the noise it makes. Can not recommend .	-1
The Spracht AURA BluNote Bluetooth speaker originally sold for $ 130 which is an absurd price considering its cheap build quality and barely acceptable sound quality . I purchased mine for about 60 % less than that and still feel this speaker is an inferior value . The sound is simply too poor to make this suitable for any sort of serious music listening . No dynamic range or anything resembling bass . And forget about playing it loud . When a company releases a product this poor it makes me question it as a whole . Pass on Spracht and spend your money on brand that shows concern for product quality .	-1
I heard the BOSE version of this style product but could not afford $ 300 , so tried this $ 50 version.1st : the battery cover is flimsy : it was difficult to snap on and I was afraid I was going to break it.2nd : the stream was horrible . Maybe I got a lemon , but every 2 or three seconds the sound would stop and then start again ... very irritating.3rd : the blinking blue night is also a huge irritation ! Stop the blinking and make it steady. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- My wallet said , & # 34 ; SPRACHT ! ! ! & # 34 ; when it coughed up the dough for this toy .	-1
Not compatible with iOS 7.0.4 . Supposedly this unit ( which I otherwise like ) is compatible with the iPhone 5S . However , the firmware is n't compatible with the latest version of Apple 's software.Also , their customer service leaves a lot to be desired.Returning it .	-1
In the process of returning , apparently received a defective unit , that would not pair with my car or any of my bluetooth enabled phones .	-1
Both my husband & I are using AT & T ; - I 'm on an iPhone , he is not . He has resisted getting an iPhone because until he & I met a couple of years ago , he only experienced dropped calls very rarely . Whenever we are speaking , or if I am speaking to anyone else on my iPhone , I lose the signal 3 times minimum and have to re-dial . This is a notorious problem with the iPhone that has only experienced minor improvement after some software updates.I frequently lose signal strength in some areas in the greater DFW metroplex . I was anxious to try out this kit that could make my phone more accessible ( ie , not flopping around in the passenger seat or next to the emergency brake ) and reduced dropped calls.There was an adhesive mount and A/C vent mount included . I have learned from experience never to put adhesive on my dash . I live in Texas and when the sun comes out in the summer , volcanos send sympathy cards to the asphalt ! Any adhesive will turn runny , sticky and unable to hold onto anything with more weight than a postage stamp when your car sits out in the hot Texas sun . I 've always been strongly mechanically inclined and had to fiddle with the A/C vent mount for 45 minutes before I finally threw my hands up in the air with modest defeat . I decided it was ok for it to hang from one side and bounce around - if only I could get better signal strength.In fairness , I have a new VW Beetle ... they are known for their large sloping dashes , steep angled windshields , etc . There may be no good way to mount this in a Beetle with a 'universal ' kit.Sliding the phone in the cradle and getting it to properly mount on the 30 pin connector is not a one-handed procedure . I had to take the mount off the A/C vent and pull on the plastic in the front to get my iPhone 3GS to finally properly seat onto that connector . That was about as frustrating as trying to get the cradle onto the vent , then trying to remove it.I watched the video , followed the instructions step by step and mounted the magnetic antenna . I was disappointed to see that the antenna that came with the kit was wired so that no matter how you mounted the antenna , there was access to a cable that someone could vandalize . When you live in a city like Dallas , people cut such cords just for fun . I ran the lengthy ( nice length for routing along door/floor trim ) cable under my seat and up the side of the interior of the Beetle and ran the cord out the top of the hatch back where the rubber trim protected the cord from being crimped . The small antenna has a strong magnet - strong enough to keep that thing mounted even in strong winds . I sometimes go to the mall or shopping and will put a jacket on top of things I do n't want people getting tempted by . A cunning thief need only tug on the antenna if they notice the cord , to pull the cradle along the car interior to move the jacket out of the way to see what is underneath . No , they wo n't be able to just pull the whole kit-n-kaboodle out of the car without breaking some glass , but it is something to think about . The kit provides a list of available antennas , including a glass mount which would avoid such problems , that can be acquired for the kit . It ' s shame that a glass mount antenna was not included from the get-go.After going through all of this frustration , I drove around and made some calls . In areas where I know I typically get less than 5 bars , I saw no improvement . I 'd unseat the phone and pop it into the cradle - the familiar charging beep could be heard and the battery symbol showed a lightning bolt through it - it was seated - antenna was securely attached , cable was not crimped - and no improvement . Not only was there no improvement , two people I called said that there was an echo when I talked . The minute I 'd pull the phone out of the cradle , the echo would go away . I was using the Apple-provided earbuds , not the speaker phone.During the demo video , the viewer can clearly see an improvement in signal strength . I saw no such improvement . This could have to do with the car and the area in which I live , but I know I was underwhelmed either way and frustrated with the difficulty in getting my iPhone in the cradle ( this is without a case on the phone , of course ) and trying to mount the cradle in my car .	-1
I put this new battery in a cellphone and it was a waste of money . Cellphone dies every day because battery is low . Do n't bother buying this .	-1
Do n't waste your time . This item came ripped when it arrived and never fit my old iphone . Keep looking for something else !	-1
I love the slip on jelly type cell phone cases but the color was not accurate to the picture and it would not stay on my phone at all . If I even picked it up the cover would just slide right off . : ( At least it was super cheap though so I did n't waste a lot of money on it .	-1
The case does not fit my phone well . It is loose and tends to fall off . It is an okay product but not for my I phone .	-1
I wanted something sturdier to protect my iphone . I thought this was very flimsy and not at all sturdy enough for protection . I would not recommend this case .	-1
Nope to floppy ! And u sent three i only ordered one . Thanks anyway ! ! Happy sales to you all . Pink black	-1
I checked to make sure I ordered the correct iPhone case before ordering , just to make sure since I ordered it expedited mail , which in reality cost more than the item itself . My iPhone case broke and I ca n't afford to replace a cell phone so I needed a case immediately . This case is slippery when you put it in . It covers up the volume buttons , although it does have little `` bumps '' where the volume buttons are but they are slippery . The cover also partially covers up the camera lense . It is impossible to take a photograph with the case on . Truly , this item is total garbage . I should have spent the extra money for the Otterbox . Mine last for over a year and held up to everything !	-1
this product was terrible , it was cut up , smelled bad , did not fit phone like promised . i would not recommend for people to purchase . get an otterbox yeah they can range from 15-50 $ on amazon but they protect your phone greatly and otterboxes are the best cases around .	-1
They are cheap and also cheap made , it is better idea spend more money to get better product i would say	-1
I did n't like this product at all . It feels super cheap and did n't provide any drop protection . There are better cases in the same price range .	-1
It was nice in color , and thats about it . The texture/ material of it made it so rough to slip into your jean pockets . It just kinda slipped around on your phone , It also collected so much lint or other materials ... I wouldnt get this if i was you	-1
It 's in perfect condition but slides off my phone when I 'm using it in any way . It 's not for the Apple IPhone 3GS .	-1
soft rubber and loose fit . rubs against my pocket fabric and it is never easy to take out . good protection tho . good price .	-1
Due to the poor sound quality , I threw this cheapie in my laptop bag as a backup . I bought aPlantronics M20 Bluetooth Headset - Retail Packaging - Graphite/Blackfor daily use . It has much better sound quality , plus I like the sliding on-off switch .	-1
I really wanted to like this charging station , but it turned out to be a huge pain in the butt all the time . First I had to buy so many accessories ( mini surge protector , 2-in-1 USB cords ) that it ended up being much more expensive than I anticipated . Then whenever I needed to adjust the cords for a new device or to move a device in the grass I had to open it up -- HUGE TIME SUCK . Finally the two top layers are quick flimsy ... I bought an iDapt i4 Charger as a replacement -- I wanted something sleek and modern looking -- and have been thrilled with its performance and ease .	-1
I received this and it worked probably the first 4 times and then the zipper broke . I would use the zipper only twice a day and I was very disappointed that it broke so quickly . I guess you get what you pay for it was enexpensive and so was the material as well .	-1
This is way too big to carry in a pocket ( unless it 's a big jacket pocket . I needed a place to put my bluetooth that would protect it and I could keep it in my pocket so I would n't lose my 3rd ( or is it 4th ) bluetooth headset . This will be useful to somebody with a large purse that they keep losing their headset in - you 'll find this puppy ! So I 'm still looking for something to keep my bluetooth headset in when I 'm not using it but want it with me for quick access .	-1
Smaller then the photos make it out to be . My charger did not fit in the case . Although my Bluetooth did fit fine . The case was a little big for only a BT but too small to also place charger int he case . Which defeats my needs ( travel needs ) for the case .	-1
Sadly , . though the description says the Plantronics Voyager Pro headset fits in this case - it does not . Not even close . I unfortunately discarded the packaging so I can not return the three I purchased . My fault . Also , the zipper closure is very tight to the point of being almost impossible to open and close . Lesson learned - order 1 , check for fit , keep the packaging and return it if it does not fit because the description was wrong .	-1
My cousin got this phone , and has had 2 replacements and has never had it wet or even abused the phone any . It had the screen going out , turning rainbowish colors . Her second phone seems to be working , but neither of us seem to think it is an impressive phone	-1
Already the touch screen is going out . I do n't know why I even tried to go back to this phone . Its simple and the slide out keyboard is nice but overall it just stinks .	-1
The price is great . You get three screen protectors . But for some reason when you place the screen protector on your phone it creates air bubbles , which is very hard to remove . I tried many ways to remove the air bubbles , but the air bubbles wo n't go away . That gives the screen a bad look . The product is made of very thin material so its almost not noticeable which is the good thing about this screen protector . If only the air bubbles would not have been created this would have been a good product . But then again it could be because of my phone and may not happen to other phones.In summary , great product if you can avoid the air bubbles .	-1
Con : 1-Very hard to install without bubles . 2-Size does not fit perfectly . 3-Scratched right on the first day of used ! Reusable is a mislead statement.Pro : NoneUpdate : OEM shop has refunded my money , so I give this product one more stars . As OEM shop , I willing to give it 5 stars for quick action to correct the problem . Hopefully Accessory Export would make its product more quality .	-1
They are very cheap . They were for small childred and they did n't cost that much . Was n't long before they were broken .	-1
My son used these and thought they were great . After about 2 months of light use they just sort of fell apart . They could not be used or glued back together . He was very sad and I am unwilling to replace them because of the poor quality .	-1
Earphones with an M & M ; 's theme , are kind of a cute idea . If you are looking for some economic earphones , for young children who are more concerned with appearance , rather than sound quality , you might consider them.If you want a decent sound however , save your money and look elsewhere . The sound quality is muddy , with a heavy bias on the low end . High frequencies are not reproduced well , and for regular music , it can even be hard to make out some vocals . In addition , the build quality appears to be on the cheap side , in some areas . The cord is very thin , and probably more prone to breakage.Perhaps these earphones are intended for small children , as out of the package they come with tiny silicone earbuds attached , that are too small for most adults to wear . Larger sized earbuds are included ( loose inside package , so do n't lose them ) . To install the larger earbud , you first need to remove the tiny one ( do n't tear it ! ) . There is a technique to attaching the larger earbud . Turn it inside out , and attach it to the stem with the speaker , then push the edges down to get it back to the proper shape . With the large sized earbuds installed , you can get a snug fit , but probably not one that cuts out too much of the ambient sound.These phones may look cool to some , but that 's about the only positive . They do not reproduce sound well , and may not last for very long . The fit is comfortable , but if the earbuds get torn , you will probably need to buy new earphones , as a spare set of earbuds is not provided.If you are looking for earphones in the same price range , that sound better , do a better job of cutting out ambient sound , are available in a variety of colors , and have a spare set of earpads , take a look at JVC 's Marshmallow series .	-1
It help open my case but one problem looks used and the picture says ill receive 2 clip openers and I only received only 1 was up with that and one for $ 2.99 and used not cool ill never gon na buy from this product ill just use my nails : /	-1
Item was as described , and the plastic is reasonably hard , but the plastic is not strong enough to do what I needed it for . I needed to open an iPod touch . It may work in other situations , but not what I bought it for . The product is not defective , it is just not up to the task that I had envisioned it for.I would suggest you get the iSesamo metal case opener ( which I also bought ) which works a lot better . The metal does not bend as much as I thought it would , even thought the blade is thin .	-1
This battery was not the same as the original equipment ; it did work with the phone which was a great choice for my mother .	-1
I bought this for my phone and it did n't even work . I was not happy about it at all . One of those moments where you wish you would have just put in the extra money the first time .	-1
this cell phone case it 's ok but it mayed of of plastic so when you get it make sure the ergde 's do n't break off are you will have to but another one.i had 4 of them that broke on me and would not stay on and all .	-1
I purchased this as my first bluetooth headset because I thought it was cute . Bad idea . It has very poor , patchy sound quality and those that I speak to say it is echoey and hard to hear . I have smaller ears and this is very uncomfortable to wear . I am returning this for a different headset .	-1
I had this earpiece . Liked it for the few months ( 4 ? ) I had it . Picked it up one day and the whole thing fell apart . I suddenly had 6 pieces in my hand . Irreparable . I 'm not rough with my bluetooths ; shocked when this happened . Very poor workmanship , very cheap materials.DO N'T BUY THIS ! ! ! As others have said -- and I agree -- it has no longevity . The only positive about this earpiece is that it 's pretty .	-1
Maybe this product just is n't for me . As long as the lens is protected I 'd rather let my camera get scratched up then deal with this thing hanging off of it . The D-Wrap screws into the tripod case on your camera and is sized for small point-and-shoot models . The attachment screw slides on a rail and the material is elastic so it should fit any camera of this class . It adds minimal bulk but does n't protect the sides.The problem is what happens when you unwrap the case . Now you 've got this foot long thing dangling from the bottom of your camara . It really gets in the way - especially if you turn the camera for a portrait shot.In practice , I found this too inconvenient to use . I 'd rather have a case that fully protects it for travel and I 'll put the camera in my pocket or a bag for ease of use during a day of sightseeing .	-1
When I saw that Vine was offering Lowepro D-Wrap , I jumped on it because I own several point-and-shoot cameras . This camera wrap asserts that it fits ( or stretches to fit ) most cameras . Unfortunately , that does not include my Canon A630 PowerShot.While the wrap stretches , it would require three strong men to stretch it around my Canon . So , even though it screwed into the tripod mount as advertised , it would mean more effort to get it into place than I could give it.Giving up on my Canon , I tried it on my Flip video camera . Yes , it folds over and protects it nicely , unless , that is , you screw it into the tripod mount . At that point , it become impossible to stretch it over the entire camera because at that point the camera is vertical and too tall to fit.Finally , I tried it on my mother 's Kodak SureShot . Voila ! It fits ( with a moderate amount of stretching ) . It 's open at the ends , so the camera is still subject to foreign objects entering from the side , but it does protect the lens and viewing screen from dust and other undesirables while the camera is in purse or pocket.By the way , if you carry your camera in your pocket , you 'll probably want to have a large pocket because the neoprene does not slide around easily in a close space and will not slip down into a tight jeans pocket.So would I recommend this camera glove ? It depends . It depends on the size of your point-and-shoot camera . It depends on how often you use your camera and whether you 've already got camera protection . Those who already have a case they use will probably not benefit from this D-wrap .	-1
If I knew I could make the same basic thing by cutting a piece of cardbard to size , I would have saved the order hassle . This is such a flimsy item I ca n't believe all the positive reviews . My wife thought it was trash and threw it away when I left it on the counter . It does n't adjust at all and did not securely hold my droid . I purchased this to take family self portraits but it did n't hold it at the proper angle . Not comfortable risking my droid 's safety by placing it in this thing . I cetainly would n't try to interact with the droid 's screen while in this holder .	-1
I did n't like this product . It was n't very sturdy and I ended up sending it right back . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
A piece of plastic with a crease in the center so it quasi folds . Silicon `` feet ' ? Silicon scraps pushed on the so called feet . Sure , they do n't slip , but as soon as you put any pressure on the iPod , the thing collapses . Junk . Pure , marketing junk . Nothing but a load of bollocks . If it were metal , it would be something but this is easily made from a piece of packaging plastic , I wish I had known how flimsy it would be . There 's more effort spent on the company branding than on the materials . Never again .	-1
Clever gadget , but no extra room in the notch that holds the iPhone to deal with a rubber cover around the edge.When the iPhone is in the vertical position , the data/power cord will not fit neatly into the phone .	-1
I recently purchased this product from amazon for its noise-canceling audioIQ technology . I wanted to use it mainly for in the car and on my moped . However , upon using it I was greatly disappointed ! The bluetooth is very cheaply made , I can not understand what I am paying $ 70 for ! I tested it several times after the recommended full charge and several problems occurred : the max volume and the clarity of the call.I had to turn up the volume to compensate for the poor clarity of the call . Instead of crisp audio , what I heard several times on end was an echo-like quality of sound . It was very difficult to hear my girlfriend when I was standing outside the car in the parking lot . Another instance ( while driving ) , I had to turn the air conditioning practically off so that I could hear my contact speaking to me . The max volume is also very limited , it had difficulty when walking by a busy park and the volume was just not loud enough . It was ridiculous ! Though I asked many times how well she could here me through the line , and she said very well . She did n't even know that I was using a bluetooth- in fact she was wondering why my voice sounded so much clearer than it usually does when I call her . So kudos to the voice capturing system ( AudioIQ ) .Second issue was the clarity of the incoming signal . The next contact I called was a mile away from me , both with Verizon and both with the same reception bars ( 3 out of 4 ) . However , I could hardly hear the nuances in his voice . Not at all what I expected after reading the reviews of this product ! The voices ( all of my contacts ) had an echoing tone and was distracting and I had to spend most of my time trying to figure out what they said than proceeding with my part of the conversation.I would also like to mention that the controls to the ProVoyager were pretty poorly designed . The buttons have to be pressed fairly hard , changing the desired position of the earpiece . A minor annoyance , but after a while , an unbearable process . And the voice command button ( along the base of the boom ) is a bit tricky to use . When pressed it pushes into my ear ( fairly uncomfortable ) and again , repositions the device on my ear.So I will be returning it for the Plantronics Voyager which costs $ 40 and is a lot more reliable . Thanks for reading . Good luck !	-1
This bluetooth headset functioned well enough , but I found it very uncomforable and bulky . Too much of a pain to use !	-1
This product : * was comfortable* functioned as advertised* had good battery life* was loud enough* had good outgoing sound ( based on comments of those who called ) * was FRAGILE -- the stem between the battery compartment and earpiece brokeThe poor durability is my biggest concern . If it only lasts a few months , it 's a poor value at more than $ 80 .	-1
This head piece was too bulky for my liking . However , the sound quality was outstanding !	-1
At my office , for years , I have used thePlantronics CS70/HL10 DECT 6.0 Bundle Wireless Headset System with Lifterand love it . It fits perfectly , is full of volume and microphone adjustments and I do n't notice it is on me.I have also used thePlantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset [ Retail Packaging ] as my primary headset with my previous Motorola RAZR and loved it . However , when I switched to the iPhone 3GS , people could n't hear me well anymore.Upon first using the Voyager Pro , the other person sounded more digitized than the 510 . Also , my biggest problem with this headset -- the other person sounds quiet , tinny and distant . I tried the various earpieces with and without the felt cover , but it was all the same . In comparing the 510 with this model , the 510 's earpiece goes much deeper into the ear canal , getting the speaker deeper in , creating a better sound and sealing out other sounds . Even when pushing in the Voyager Pro , the earpiece collapses instead of going deeper in.I had these hearing issues with the volume all the way up with the windows up in the car . If I had the windows down , it would be impossible to hear.I was n't impressed with the controls of the Voyager Pro compared with the 510 either . The power button is difficult to find and push compared to the 510 . The volume button are difficult to distinguish from one another . On the 510 , each has a different slope , making it easy to know which is which . The answer/hang up/voice dial button forces you to smash the whole headset into your ear canal to activate and it is difficult to know whether you are pressing it . On the 510 , you could hear the button being pushed or let off and you could easily counteract the force with your thumb behind , keeping the earpiece from crushing your ear.This is just not usable for me , I will be returning it . Now back to the drawing board .	-1
Uncomfortable and noise cancelling is much better with other brands . I use headsets to communicate while driving , often at interstate speeds , and this headset is difficult to hear and for my customers to hear me on . It is also very bulky behind my ear and , with glasses on , gets quite uncomfortable quickly.Also , the small rubber-like connector section between the main battery and electronics section ( behind the ear ) and the boom is very prone to breaking . Two of these broke in less than a year for me . Just a less than perfect engineering design IMHO.Finally , if you have any face hair or stubble , it will probably get caught in the mic screen and/or cause scratching noises in your listener 's ear .	-1
I previously owned a Plantronics Voyager 510 . I was so happy with it , that I bought this one , thinking it was a leap forward . I was extremely disappointed . It did n't stay connected as well as the much older 510 , sound quality was n't as good either for me or the people I spoke to with it . It broke where it was supposed to pivit while inserting it in my ear one day . I glued it back and got another 5 months of use before it simply quit working . I attempted to replace the large ear insert , and could not buy them with the covers . I had to change a flat tire in the sun one day , and I guess my sweat , or the heat of being in my ear in the 95 degree sun killed it . I 've done a lot more with the older Voyager 510 , it still works , but after nearly six years the battery is n't charging well , so it is time to replace . I wo n't make another mistake and buy a Voyager Pro though . I 'll look for something else .	-1
My biggest problem with the Bluetooth headsets is they are not loud enough . If that is your main issue with the bluetooth headsets , then this one is not for you . Purchase the Plantronics Voyager 510 over this one . I have them both and the Plantronics Voyager 510 is definitely louder . I tested both with same phone ( Blackberry ) and set max volume levels on both phone and bluetooth.. The 510 was around 25 % louder IMO . I 'm going to return this one .	-1
The headset pairs fine and is comfortable enough , but is n't loud enough to hear well outdoors even at top volume .	-1
This bluetooth lasted me less than a week ... I have had over 15 and I was really interested in the dual speaker for clarity and pick up . not worth the price , the setup is flimsy and cheap . Broke very quickly ...	-1
I go through a lot of head sets and I am going through this one is going to be no different-as in I am going to send it back ! This thing is so big you might as well try to tape your phone to your ear . And behind your ear at that ! It is so big it feels ( too me ) as if someone is tugging on your ear ! It is not uncomfortable but actually painful ! Sound quality ? Maybe I have a bad one ? Static filled , not loud enough and not clear . Sometimes when the phone is in my pocket it does not work clearly . That is only 3 feet away ! Now the real downside ... .I do not have a good recommendation for you but , I just ordered 5 different brands/types that I have not tried before.Someone has to make a good bluetooth headset . I will endeavor to find one .	-1
Probably the best bluetooth headset I have ever tried , the dual mics on the Plantronics Voyager PRO Bluetooth Headset have such a great sound that it 's hard to tell that you 're on a bluetooth.The cons were that it does n't fit me very well , I had to keep adjusting it and every time I did , I would hang up on a call.That said I found myself disconnecting calls , readjusting too often.It 's just not for me .	-1
For the high price of 200.Both BrokeOne usb charge plate broke off ... . wo n't chargethe other just fell apart the rubber its made out of wo n't last wires exposed brokenI bought a wired head set for 2 dollarsGiving 2 stars because plantronics replaced both headsets .	-1
Seller did an excellent job and sent the headset right away . I am very pleased with the seller and the service I received . However , this headset does nothing to impress me . The battery life on this blue tooth is way TOO short ! I thought I was getting a better replacement for my old Motorola blue tooth that finally died after 6 years , NOT ! ! We 've owned several blue-tooth and this one is a big let down . Not only can you NOT put it on your ear and enjoy an entire day out without the thing going dead , everyone I talked to said I sounded `` muffled '' at times . I drive an 18wheeler and this headset captures too much background noise . I only give this an average score . I let my teenage daughter have this one and I am looking for a better one .	-1
I had high hopes for this device , but ultimately I am buying a new device b/c this one is inadequate . I 'll just list the pros/cons from my experience of using this device on a daily basis for almost 4 months . I use this device with the Droid Razr Maxx.Pro : * Good wind noise reduction when outside* Pairs very easily with the devices I 've tried . * Reasonable battery life - I can talk for 4 or 5 hours in a day with no problems.Cons : * Bad sound quality : I get reports from listeners of echos , clipped speech and low sound volume regularly . I know it 's not the cell service b/c when I switch to the device directly listeners say `` Ah , that 's much better now . `` * Bulky : it 's fairly big as a device around the ear , so wearing sunglasses and this device is n't great . * Annoying : After fully charging overnight , the device will report `` battery medium '' after about an hour of use . To make it worse , it actually says `` Battery medium '' in a British female voice during a call , causing me to miss words of the other party . *This can not be disabled . *UPDATE : I purchased the expensive Bose deviceBose Bluetooth headset Series 2 - Left earto replace this one , and while it has a worse battery life , it charges quickly and the sound quality is tremendously better . I use the bose device all the time and have finally found a bluetooth headset I can rely on .	-1
After a couple of months with this headset I have to give it a bad review . It does not perform well with my iPhone and often callers say my speech sounds all warbled and scratchy . Further , it 's uncomfortable to wear and feels heavy behind my ear . I also can not wear my sunglasses with it.I get much better mic quality either holding my iPhone up to my ear without a headset , or using the wired one that came with it.I regret my purchase of this Plantronics .	-1
This has the best sound and useability but it has had to be replaced several times under warranty . My guess if one is an occasional user it is a 5 star but if one is a heavy user i.e . daily user - that is why there are so many one stars . If they would fix its failures it would be a clear winner .	-1
These styluses are cheap enough so worth a try I received 2 and one worked better than the other on my iPhone 4 and iPad 2 though both look the same . It 's a hit and miss really . If you 're just tapping a smartphone you will probably be happier than if you bought it for your iPad.Smartphones have smaller screens so this stylus despite its non-responsiveness to some taps , does a better job than your finger for selecting web links or playing some games . It 's not too great for writing or sketching but still more precise than a finger on a smartphone screen . For an iPad you have more surface area and your finger works pretty well , so you will be more frustrated when repeated taps on the glass bring no response.Once again , it 's a hit and miss with the quality so you may get a decent one or a bad one which is not too great . Not bad if you want to keep them in a couple different places like your car , office etc . They can come in useful in the winter when you do n't want to take off your gloves .	-1
Be warned this microUSB cable can not be used to sync WM6.5 smart phones to PC . My HTC pure wo n't work with this cable , but it works fine with the original cable comes with the phone device . Apparently not all microUSB cables are the same .	-1
I purchased this simple batery for a cell phone one would think that would be a no brainier . wrong This seller does not respond to email and I a having to go threw Amazon jut to get my money back If you are smart you will not buy from this seller	-1
Very hard to operate.Hard to get synced up with the phones . Instructions do not help either . Waste of money	-1
[ Edit : after writing this , I took out the Jawbone again , reset it , fully charged it and tried to see if I could get it to work as well as others are claiming . In a single day over the weekend , I left it on and was only able to make it last just over one total hour of talk time before the battery died in the middle of a call . The total talk time was measured across three separate calls . This was over about 6-hours of total total `` use '' in one day whilst out and about . Same issues still with this one and the others I had . I 'll try calling/returning directly to Jawbone and see what happens since it 's paid for . If I could change my 'star ' rating from a 2 to a 1 star during and edit , I would . Who knows , maybe the green one will work better . ] This is probably the best looking headset available , but that 's really where the positive comments stop . Well , not exactly , it 's also very light and charges very quickly to reach full charge ( & lt ; 1-hour ) .I have had three ( 3 ) Jawbone Primes and all behaved the same with one that simply stopped `` working '' after a few weeks . Why three ? I bought one thinking it looked great and I loved what I had read ( reviews as well as technicals on Jawbone 's site ) . It simply was not living up to the sound quality nor battery life I expect for something in this category that I pay a premium price of $ 130 for . I returned it thinking something *had* to be wrong with it . The second was the same and just quit working after a few weeks . I thought , `` OK , this definitely has problems so I 'll try again and get what I thought I was paying for . '' No go . I returned it after a month.You might be reading this thinking it 's my phone or environment . I would think this too , but I rotate between three distinct phones regularly ( I go through phones more often than headsets ) . I used them on Nokia N97 , G1 Android , and iPhone 3GS . Also , I linked to my computer for Internet calls . The environment varied from sitting at home and driving in a car to office and outside.First , the earbuds were too `` mushy '' and none fit right - the phone was always slipping so I bought a set of Plantronics earbuds . This fixed that issue.Second , The sound was not great . Many I spoke to complained about the sound . On my end , there was nothing special regarding call sound that I could n't get in units half the price . The noise cancellation was no better than a Nokia BH-703 or Sony ( forget the model right now ) that I own . Since this is their claim to fame , I did test this thoroughly in various noisy environments , particularly with the Nokia BH , switching between the units . Wind , train , traffic , riding in a car , TV and others . It was not any better and in some cases worse . Yes , I was carful to make sure I had the Jawbone properly fitted with it touching my face appropriately.Third , the battery life on all three was simply poor . Unlike others , my experience was that it did not live up to the 4.5 hour talk time claim . I have meetings I take on the phone frequently that are one to two hours in length . Without exception , using a full charge to start , each unit would last about an hour . I had one go to 93-minutes , but only once . With light use and leaving on all the time , I had to charge daily . This was bad to the point I found myself wondering how much battery was left all the time . This is bad user experience . Speaking of charging , this is where it actually does great . Less than one hour charging on a completely dead battery and full charge is back . Unfortunately , that does n't mean much.Fourth , the Noise Assassin button was problematic . All three had problems with it sticking and being pushed in so much that it lost it 's raise so I had to push very hard to get it to work : not good when you do n't use the strap ( or even if you did for that matter ) . I also had a problem changing modes frequently when I was simply trying to cycle through the volumes.Fifth , no dedicated power button , but this I could have lived with , but the light that indicates state was under my thumb making it difficult to know if on or off . I inadvertently left the Jawbone on many times when I thought I held it long enough.Sixth , Jawbone documentation and web site state holding the power button for 3-4 seconds for power on/off as well as when putting in pairing mode . Try about 10-seconds and you 'll be closer.Seventh , I had to hard reset all three of them more than once.Eighth , I just forgot what this was , but it 's good . Oh , now I remember , it 's a big pain to remember the various button presses , holds and combinations to get the various functionality ( call answer/hangup , volume , noise assassin on/off , voice call , etc . ) Ninth : I am contemplating if this is the worst aspect : the sound is terrible . A lot of static/noise that I notice and people on the other end have trouble hearing me . It 's persistent regardless where I am ( inside , outside , car , etc. ) . Sometimes it just disconnects from the phone ( bluetooth just drops ) . I 'm pretty sure my pocket or hand are not over 33 ' away from it . Neither issues are apparent with other , lesser expensive units.You 're probably bored reading this by now . What fascinates me is the fact I went through three of these and used with many devices and always had consistently bad experience yet this does seem to get some good reviews and the unit is popular . I do n't think I 'd pay $ 60 for this , but I might because of looks and lightness . However , it is simply too much work , problematic and poor earbuds ( costing you more money ) for the premium price .	-1
My original Jawbone was a wonderful headset . Clear , understandable and others could hear me clearly . When I lost that unit , I went back to Jawbone.The only model available was the Prime . Its performance just does n't measure up to expectations from the Original . The Prime is fine for me to hear , but the microphone is terrible . The first unit went back under warranty because the static from the mike was so bad . My wife used it to demonstrate to me on another phone how bad.The replacement unit ( I had to pay to return the first unit ) had a slightly different but similar issue . Still no one could hear me talking and what they did hear sounded like an echo . The Jawbone service techs were polite but said all they could do with the second issue was to refer the question to 'the front office , ' who have not responded in over a month.Folks in the phone stores recommended other manufacturers for BT headsets . I should have listened .	-1
Good news : it looks cool and it is light-weight.Bad news : Poor fit , for my ears . The ear loop did n't improve the fit . The volume adjustment is not intuitive ; I find myself reaching for the phone to turn the volume up or down.Conclusion : Jawbone being one of the more expensive bluetooth headsets in the market , it simply did n't live up to its price tag .	-1
Good News : Audio is above-average and pairing is rock-solid.Bad News : Three ( 3 ) Design Flaws ... Design Flaw 1 : ButtonsThe combination power/activation button is a major design flaw . My device turned itself on and off ( or activated my phone ) over and over.This is a problem for many reasons , not the least of which is battery life.As others have mentioned , pressing this button ( even accidentally ) can end calls . Ont eh Jawbone ICON , the button was relocated to the back - a `` stroke of genius '' according to owners of both devices.The issue is that it does n't take much pressure to activate the button . Even if the Jawbone button is facing outward ( that is , not touching your leg but rather touching your pants pocket ) , it is enough to click the button.Others have also complained about the separate volume button ( it cycles ; there is no up/down rocker ) .Design Flaw 2 : EarloopsThe second major issue ( for someone like me who requires a loop ) is the connection from loop to phone . I 've gone through three ( 3 ) of the leather loops and one ( 1 ) of the plastic loop displayed on/with the device on the product page . The connector just snaps after 2-3 weeks of use . Customer support was initially rude and arrogant ( requiring me to send back the broken loop ) , but after I provided a photo , they replaced one of the leather loops.Design Flaw 3 : Removing ear rubber thingsAnd finally , the third issue is the ear rubber thing . While you should never have to replace it , based on Design Flaw 2 , I had to ( a ) remove it to get the serial number , and ( b ) change sizes to make the Jawbone fit while I awaited a replacement earloop . This took 30 minutes and three people , before we thought we were going to rip the rubber piece in two.Aliph was in denial on these , but based on their actions ( releasing the Jawbone ICON with an inner power switch ) , the combination button is clearly not optimal .	-1
I thought I would love this piece but the wrap around ear adapter broke off immediately and the stay in the ear rubber plug never stayed in my ear more that 10 minutes before popping out and it I tried to adjust it during a call it would sense my hand touching it and thing I wanted to hang up on the call . I do n't even know where that thing is anymore ...	-1
Cheap ! Cheap ! This phone has the worst caller ID display I 've ever seen . The handset does n't feel right . The wall mount option is a joke . Just try to do the wall mount .	-1
We had the phone for about 3 months before I threw it away . There was static on the phone from the day we got it . people stopped calling out or answering the phone because we just could n't hear . not worth trying to return .	-1
I was looking for some cheap phones to put in our bedrooms and living rooms . We no longer use a landline much since our cell phones have so many minutes . We now use the magic jack and only make occassional calls . I was hoping this phone would be a good choice.Pros : cheap , nice lookingCons : poorly made , when pushing the phone buttons it does n't have much sound feedback to tell you if you 've pushed it , the LED on the front has no light so you can not see the numbers you are calling or the people calling you , and unfortunately it takes batteries to use the caller ID ( that may be standard and I did n't knock of points for that , but it sucks ) .Of the 4 phones I ordered , one was bad out of the box , but that could be a fluke . To me , it 's a pain making a call , since you really have to pay attention when pushing the buttons . Most other phones give you a nice loud sound when pushing the number buttons.All in all , I 'm sorry I went so cheap on this phone , and wish I 'd spent just a few dollars more and gotten something better .	-1
I had the worst experience with Elago . They labeled the product wrong when i searched for it , which led me to receiving the wrong product . I wanted a stylus for a touchscreen phone and they sent me a stylus for a palm device . The plastic stylus was not recognized by my phone so i e-mailed Elago and they informed me that they sent out the wrong model ... way to go , real professional Elago . If that does n't make matters worse , they did n't offer to send me a new one ... they wanted me to ship the original first . I ended up returning the original because i wanted what i paid for ... i returned it through UPS and did n't get a word from them after a few days . I e-mailed them again and it seems as if they completely forgot about my situation ... so when they got the e-mail , they responded that they have sent it out to me . When i finally got the product i originally ordered ... they sent me a stylus that does work but it has a fat rubber tip . The product i wanted had a ball point end . At this moment , I just gave up ... screw this company , screw their products . I do not recommend ... ever ... .ever . Please do yourself a favor and buy a product elsewhere on amazon .	-1
Uh , the descripton needs to read that the Elago Retractable Stylus is for `` some '' Touchscreen Wireless Phones . It does not work on the Android Touchscreens . It does not have the appropriate tip for the Android Touchscreen . And , the seller wants you to walk over crushed glass in barefeet in order to return an item that does not do what they said it would do . So you end up paying for a thing and the shipping on the thing that does not work . Plus you have to make another purchase for a stylus that does work on The Android Touchscreen . Rrrggh .	-1
I bought this for my IPhone 4 and IPod touch 4th Generation . This DOES NOT work on Apple . Not worth the money at all . I feel like I got ripped off .	-1
I do n't like this product at all only had for about 2 weeks and it 's not working anymore so do n't buy this product not good at all .	-1
Cell phone problems ? Complete your `` suite '' of abuse with the `` highly '' rated `` Jawbone Prime Platinum '' by Aliph . Not only is it expensive but even Spock could not get it to stay in his ear . And , dispite it 's high price the audio qulity is not that good.With the previous model ( which did not stay in you ear either ) you could remove all the rubber earpices and jam it into your ear and enjoy resonable quality while driving your convertible with the top down.No more and no more . This baby is going back.This is my 5th headset in as many weeks . Before I go back to a can and a piece of string ... .anyone out there have anything they like ? If it is not going to work very well at least have it be cheap .	-1

I 've got aBlackBerry Bold , as well as an iPhone 3G . I 'm not writing this review exclusively for comparing the N97 side-by-side , but given the price of this phone , the bar is set reasonably high . Obviously , nothing 's really `` as good as '' a BlackBerry when it comes to e-mail ( and you 're using a BES ) , and nothing available right now is `` as good as '' an iPhone when it comes to web browsing or application availability . So for reference , those were n't taken in to consideration.The N97 arrives in a very nice package , with a pre-charged battery and thoughtfully written manual . The included software does n't run on OS X , so I spent very limited time working with it.Within a couple of minutes of receiving the box , I threw my SIM card in and the phone was happily asking for some settings . What impressed me immediately , is that the N97 seemed to know exactly how to configure itself for data and MMS services . This is the first unbranded phone I 've used that did n't need me to enter the settings for my carrier ( AT & T ; ) .The N97 almost instantly showed a strong 3.5G signal , and started filling the home screen with information . I placed a couple of test calls , and was extremely impressed with the sound quality . Without question , this is one of the best sounding wireless phones I 've ever used.And then , the wheels started to come off ... First task : sync my work mail , contacts , and calendars via ActiveSync.This started out reasonably easy , until I realized about halfway through the wizard that I had entered a setting incorrectly . Unfortunately , once you have something in the wizard , it 's there . There 's no `` Back '' button . So , the Mail For Exchange program started complaining immediately . `` No problem '' I thought , I 'll just change the settings . This turned out to be far more convoluted than it should be . `` Options '' does n't give you a path to the settings . You have to go to hit the silver button , then go to Applications , then go to the `` MfE '' folder ( which is incredibly cryptic , if you do n't know what you 're looking for ) to change the settings.Once I had them changed , the N97 happy started grabbing everything I wanted from my Exchange server . I went back in to Options and saw some well thought out options , like setting `` prime time '' for a constant sync , and a schedule for when you do n't need instant access . There were also options for setting Out of Office notifications , and the overall experience was quite good.Second task : set up my personal e-mail account.Having used the wizard already , this was straightforward . The program asked if I wanted to connect to get my mail , and I confirmed that I did . Mail showed up , and all was good . Until I tried to leave the program . That 's when I learned that the N97 is apparently incapable of maintaining two mail connections.Annoyed , but willing to accept this limitation , I tried to put the account on my home screen , along with my Exchange account . Apparently , the N97 ca n't do this , either . You can have one mail box on the screen , regardless of the number of mail accounts you may be using.Third task : connect with my Bluetooth speakerphone.My car has a Bluetooth speakerphone . Since I can remember Bluetooth being a feature on wireless phones , Nokia seems to have dominated this space by including just about every Bluetooth profile under the sun . Pairing the N97 was n't a problem . After it was set up , I made a couple of calls ( which again , had awesome clarity ) and thought everything was fine . Until ... When I returned to my car later in the day , I noticed that calls were n't being directed to the speakerphone . As it turns out , the N97 wo n't re-pair with anything on its own . So while I could use the speakerphone with my Bold and iPhone without doing anything at all , the N97 requires you to hit the silver button , then go to Setup , then Connectivity , then Bluetooth , then Paired Devices , then pick the speakerphone , then hit `` pair '' every time.Speaking of which ... Fourth Task : answer the stupid phone.I 'm not 100 % sure this is even possible with the N97 . When the phone rings , you have a large bar with an arrow that points to nothing , and is labeled `` Answer '' . If you tap it , nothing happens . If you hit the green button , nothing . If you unlock the phone and try either , nothing.Feeling like a complete moron , I had to look it up . It turns out , the bars are sliders , similar to the Unlock slider on an iPhone . Yet , this is really the ONLY thing in the OS that acts like an iPhone.Fifth Task : get Facebook working.This was n't difficult at all . Enter your name and password , and go . The application looks similar to the BlackBerry version , which I happened to like more than the iPhone version.It does just about everything you 'd expect it to , until it crashes . Yes , that 's right . Until it crashes . Constantly . Sometimes it does a full `` I 'm kicking you back to the home screen '' crash , and other times , you get a red box telling you that your phone needs to be restarted . Sometimes the red box goes away on its own . There 's really no rhyme or reason to it.Sixth Task : read my e-mail.Well ... on the first try , I had a message that said my phone was out of memory . You see , despite having 32GB of storage for music and movies , the amount of memory your phone can actually use for programs is quite limited . The out of memory message suggested closing other applications , which I did , and which resolved nothing . Rebooting the phone worked.That 's when I discovered that the N97 is actually quite awful at rendering mail that is n't plain text.That 's also where I started to give up on the N97 . In between all of this , I also discovered that : *Your choices for incoming message alerts are either at the same volume as your ringer , or disabled . *Some things need to be double-tapped , others single-tapped , with little indication as to which is which . *The Ovi Store is basically a kludgy mess . *The keyboard will constantly register any key that you so much as brush your finger next to when typing . *There is virtually no connection between what the battery display chooses to tell you , and how much battery life you actually have . *The N97 is basically a hopeless mess of a phone.Admittedly , there are some bright spots : *The back camera takes surprisingly good pictures . *The included weather application is actually pretty cool , since it uses GPS and updates often . *The overall build quality of the phone is quite good.And sure , there are a boatload of hacks and tweaks you can make to the phone to get it to do things closer to what you want . But in my estimation , the amount of research and effort to do so is unreasonable , given this phone 's cost.I 've also heard that a new software update is imminent ( as of this review , the most recent version available for this phone is 12.0.24 ) , so that may solve some problems . But with the N900 not costing substantially more and a release date `` any day now '' , the N97 is for Symbian fans only .	-1
I have owned Nokia phones my whole life . This phone is nothing more than a N95 with a touch screen and poor integration . There are many bugs in the code right now.It has a chance to become a great phone , but wait till the first software update to see how much time & effort Nokia is going to put into it , right now you are best to hold off.UPDATE : I returned the phone back to Nokia , Too many software inconsistencies , some screens you double touch ( click ) others you only touch once . Some screens you have to use a scroll bar , others you just drag your finger to scroll down . I do n't want to have to learn which screen do what and change my habits depending on the application/menu I 'm on . Nokia should have taken the time to make all their apps and menus work the same . I would understand that 3rd party applications might be different but not the installed applications on the phone.This phone really needs to be in your hands for a day or two to figure out the frustrations with it . Do n't get me started on the poor use of memory and how if you are not a Nokia user from a long time ago , you install your apps on the default drive only to figured out the default drive is not where all the memory is . Or if you get tons of text messages it fills up the C : drive and you-the owner- have to change system settings to tell TXT MSG'ing to not use the default drive.Search the web for N97 to read and see the YouTube videos of why not to buy this dumb phone - um I mean smart phone .	-1
Hard to maintain working properly . Look for another option . there is definetely better phones of about the same or better price .	-1
I would say its a big battery , it reduced the fact that the PSP is not longer slim at one end.You would think after a couple years Sony would make an extended battery thin.Sony does it with all their playstations.I bought a slim for it to be slim , they no longer make regular batteries , so it 's all recycled now from a third party.eCity is the only one I found with a `` name '' .These extended batteries are made from Sony , so I do know they last a while .	-1
The mifi has the potential to be a breakthrough product , but unfortunately it fails in its first iteration.While casual web and email users wo n't notice this , more complicated and data intense connections ( such as connecting to a VPN ) seem to overwhelm the Mifi , and it will drop the connection to Verizon 's network and quickly reconnect . While such behavior wo n't impact email or web browsing severely , it does force VPN users to have to reinitiate a connection and start over . For business users it 's effectively useless.This is not a problem confined to a single location either . So far this behavior has occurred in multiple locations across four states even when there 's a full strength connection to the tower.Another annoyance is the charging behavior . Plugging the device into a USB port on a computer disables the wifi router and converts the device back to a traditional USB broadband access device . What were the engineers thinking ? If the battery is running low you 're forced to connect the old fashioned way to the network with bloated drivers and all of the annoyances that this device is supposed to eliminate . Activation was a pain too as it required installing all of that stuff to get started.Words can not express how truly disappointed I am in this product . Even more so the fact that both Verizon and Novatel are completely silent on the disconnect issue . There 's a good discussion on the Verizon messageboards that describes the problem ( and many users ' frustration ) in greater detail.UPDATE -- 10/24/09Novatel and Verizon released a firmware update for the device in October . I have n't used it enough to make a judgement as to whether or not this improves the situation , but some users are reporting better device behavior . I 'll report back when I learn more.Unfortunately , Mac users are out of luck on the firmware update . The device will only update with the Windows version of VZ Access manager . If you do n't have Windows running in Parallels or VMWare you need to take the unit into a Verizon store for an update . Quite a hassle.UPDATE -- 10/31/09Unfortunately the firmware update does nothing to address the problems I indicated above . I have had no less than three disconnects with the device in the last 30 minutes , and I am in sight of the tower ! I again repeat the above cautions . This device is not for professional use .	-1
I bought this MiFi thinking that I would swap it for my Aircard that I 've been using on Verizon for several years . I was attracted by the ability to have up to 5 devices share one connection.Overall the device will allow up to 5 devices to share the connection . And the speeds have been decent - averaging about 1.5 mb.The problem i that this device constantly disconnects from the Internet and you are forced to wait for it to re-connect . It 's not something everyone would notice ( you can watch it by going to the control panel at the IP address 192.168.1.1 ) .There are also some really odd problems such as not being able to update the firmware from a Mac , not being able to initially turn on the device and have it work on AC power ( I 've always had to start it up unplugged and after it 's connected attach it to the power cord ) .I think this is just a really cheap product that I would avoid . It 's probably near end-of-life and there are much better ( and faster ) alternatives coming ( see Sprint 4G Novatell ) .Before you buy - do a quick web search for issues around this model . I found many that I wish I 'd known about BEFORE I made the purchase .	-1
Purchased from ULIKE , The digitizer arrived after a month and was defective ... . several emails and pictures later they asked me to get a & # 34 ; professional & # 34 ; install , sorry I will not pay someone $ 50 to install a $ 5 screen on a 30 $ phone , I am perfectly competent enough to install a 3g digitizer having done 10~ 3G/3GS without error , and countless iPhone 4/4S . Give me my money back i ordered it on ebay for 3.99 and 2 day shipping for free	-1
I was extrememly unimpressed with this product ! The speaker cable did not fit right , do I could not hear on the phone unless it was on speaker . The earpiece speaker would not plug into the board correctly .	-1
Shipping was prompt and courteous for this item . It really , really was nothing to complain about , so I do n't blame the seller all that much , but the product is just defective . My shuffle did n't charge , and could n't be detected on the computer . I am not going to bother returning it , because for the money I spent , it 's just not worth the time or aggravation . So not worth it .	-1
Does n't work for 4th Generation iPod Shuffle . The charging adapters do n't even work . Total Piece of Mung . AVOID . I also need 20 words so that I can post this review . Really Amazon ? I have Prime with you guys and I have to do this 20 word thing ? I said everything I needed to say about the product in less than 20 words .	-1
Wow . I thought that i couldnt loose at this price . But i was WRONG ! These pens scratched and RUINED my screen protector ! Who knows what it would do to my actual ipad screen ! Not only am i out the $ 2.59 . Now i have to spend $ 25 for a new screen protector ! ! I wish I could give it 0 stars !	-1
This unit sports a micro usb connector this is what ended up breaking on mine they are very flimsey . The case makes it hard to move the ring/silent switch . Over time the case will leave nice vertical scrapes on the back of the iphone . Battery life is only so so at $ 80.00 I would not consider this accessory a very good deal .	-1
The juice pack worked great for my mother 's phone ... and then it just up and died . She had used it since Valentine 's Day ( her birthday ) , and two or three days ago 6/13/13 , it just quit working . Was n't dropped , was n't damaged . The product does as intended , but the lifespan is quite poor . Granted , I paid less than $ 30 for the battery case , but I would expect at least a 6 month lifespan . I was not impressed , but since it 's one of the only cases on the market for the purpose without running a cord to a charger hidden in her purse , I 'll most likely buy again & take my chances .	-1
I have to amend my original review ( see below ) after owning the item now for several months . I bought the Juice Pack Air in October , despite others ' complaints about signal strength , sync not working , and fragile build quality , and I had n't experienced trouble with any of these , so I gave it four stars in my early review.I 've now dropped it down after having problems . Before continuing , I should note THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO REVISIONS OF THIS DEVICE OUT THERE ; I know because I 've now had two different revisions.PROBLEM 1 : On my original Juice Pack Air , the micro-USB connector broke after two months . Sad because I was very , very satisfied with the product until that moment . I only found one or two other people around the web that mention this , but two months after purchase , the micro-USB connector on the case disappeared inside it one evening when I went to plug it in , spelling doom for the case . After determining that I could n't easily open it and fix it myself with a soldering iron or something , I put in an RMA warranty service request via the Mophie website.Service was reasonably good . Never got a human call or response , but I did get a UPS tag . I shipped them the broken case and a copy of my receipt using the tag ( so I did n't have to pay for any shipping ) and now , two weeks later , a new case has arrived . So thanks for the exchange Mophie , but it is worrying that the connector is n't attached in a more substantial way ( the replacement case is the same ) .PROBLEM 2 : Oddly , the replacement case ( supposedly exactly the same product ) does n't fit the iPhone 3Gs nicely as my original case did . This one is a full 2mm longer ( yes , LONGER ) meaning that there 's a big empty gap ( enough to slide a penny in ) between the top of the phone and the top of the case . Yes , the top IS seated all the way . It 's also not nearly as tight . I know that people have complained about the tightness of the Juice Pack Air , but I liked it . This one is still nicely made , but it 's now a much more `` slide on/slide off easily '' affair . Now the case feels less as though it will snugly protect the phone.PROBLEM 3 : The replacement unit does indeed kill my signal strength ( as others have reported ) in a way that my first unit did n't . I wonder what they 've changed between revisions that causes this ? PROBLEM 4 : Sync and charge behavior are frustratingly different with the new unit as well . Clearly there are highly different revisions of this piece of equipment out there . On my first Juice Pack Air , sync worked transparently with the Mophie attached ( just plug it in and the computer saw it ) and charging was easy , since I just left the switch on the bottom in the `` on '' position all the time and forgot about it . Plugging it into USB , both the Juice Pack AND the iPhone would charge to full at the same time . Unplugging , the Juice Pack would discharge first , then the iPhone . Now , both charging and sync behaviors are different.First , sync no longer works with the juice pack attached ( a problem many others have had ) . Second , charging now works like this : - When I plug the juice pack in ( either switch position ) , the actual iPhone does n't charge at the same time ( before , no matter whether the switch was red or green , both the iPhone AND the Juice Pack would charge in parallel if it was plugged in ) . Now , when plugged in the iPhone continues to discharge and will eventually go flat , even as the Juice Pack busily charges.- I have to set the switch to green to charge the actual iPhone , but I MUST UNPLUG the Juice Pack from power for charging to occur ( if it 's plugged in and I switch to green , the iPhone does not charge ) . And green or red , the moment I plug the Juice Pack back into power , the iPhone stops charging , no matter the switch position . So basically : you can only charge the Juice Pack when plugged into power ( not the iPhone ) . You can only charge the iPhone when not plugged into power ( and then , obviously , you ca n't charge the Juice Pack ) .Getting a full charge for both from a full flat for both thus requires the following steps with the replacement unit:1 . Plug in Juice Pack . Wait for it to charge ( meanwhile , iPhone goes dead and stays dead ) .2 . Disconnect power , flip Juice Pack to green . Wait for iPhone to charge ( meanwhile , Juice Pack runs down as it charges ) .3 . Reconnect Juice Pack , replace charge just used ( of course , when you plugged in , the iPhone stopped charging and is now running down again while the Juice Pack charges ) .In short , it 's literally impossible to actually get both to a full charge at the same time unless I take the pack OFF of the iPhone and charge them separately . The first Juice Pack Air I had ( the one that broke and was replaced under warranty ) did NOT behave this way.I suspect that they changed the behavior to this because of the complaints I 've read about overheating when both batteries were charging at the same time . I did n't experience that problem with my first Juice Pack , though they did get quite warm.IN ANY CASE , my new review is this : I 'll continue to use the thing because I bought it and it does provide extra power . But it 's a kind of grudging acceptance and frustration now rather than enthusiasm , and I 'm tempted to try to get ahold of one of the competing ( and now discontinued , no doubt due to similar types of problems ) Incase Power Slider units to see if they 're any better.Maybe there 's just no way to do this right and Apple should consider releasing an `` extended battery '' version of the iPhone that 's twice as thick for $ 200 more ? I 'd pay for it if it gave me double the battery life without all of this `` power case '' nonsense. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ORIGINAL REVIEW : So there I was sitting in the Apple Store in Manhattan trying to find a single case that protected the sync port at the bottom of the iPhone . Could n't find one . But I did find the Mophie Juice Pack Air for less than twice the price of some of the basic black silicone cases being sold at the store . `` Not bad , '' I thought , but I wanted to read a review and see whether the thing was any good , particularly since the Apple Store did n't have an open one on display for me to at least inspect the build quality . Some of the reviews complained about loss of signal strength , much lower than advertised battery power , and/or the inability to sync without removing the iPhone from the Mophie.I contemplated , then I bought , knowing that I could always return it if I hated it . Immediately upon buying , I went straight over to the nearest horizontal surface , opened it , and installed it . Then , I plugged it into the USB port on my laptop . ( 1 ) No signal strength degradation ( knock on wood ) . ( 2 ) Computer found the iPhone and all was happy with syncing ( knock on wood ) . ( 3 ) Later experience has shown that it gives me a good 70 % boost in battery length ( knock on wood ) .Apart from that , I think the build quality complaints are really baseless . This is a beautifully finished , very solid , very nicely fitting ( incredibly precise tolerances ) piece of equipment . Those that are complaining sound like they 're removing the case daily . WARNING : It 's clearly not designed to be removed and replaced over and over again , you can tell that just by looking at it . If you plan to remove it from your iPhone all the time , this is not the case for you . ( And thus , if you plan to use your iPhone with all kinds of docks and docking accessories , this is not the case for you . ) This thing is clearly intended for people in good coverage areas who use the iPhone mostly on the go , do n't have a ready pile of iPhone accessories that require docking , and need a nice cover and a boost in operation time.The only reasons I give it four stars rather than five : I have no idea how long the battery 's lifetime will be ; a lot of lesser rechargeable batteries tend to wear out after 20-30 cycles , which I have n't yet gotten to on the Mophie , and also , the micro USB cable that comes with it is TOO DAMNED SHORT ( like , a foot and a half , literally ) and I had to buy a USB extension cable . Just make the cable longer , guys .	-1
*** April 23rd Update : Unfortunately the power switch on the unit failed within only 4 weeks of having it ( and only light use ) - the switch gradually moved deeper inside the unit until one day it separated completely and just rattled around inside the case so I have reduced my review from four to one star . The idea is great but the build quality of the unit is clearly substandard . I have no confidence a replacement will fare any better since this seems to be a design flaw - in trying to get my money back Mophie claim it is TechNGnet 's problem to solve ( the original seller ) , TechNGnet claim it is Mophie 's problem . I am afraid my advice now is DO NOT buy this case from Mophie unless you are willing to flush seventy bucks down the drain . *** Original Review : I was a little hesitant to buy this battery case based on the feedback , but I knew I still needed something to help my 3GS through a busy day . I had disabled Push and only used 3G sparingly in order to nurse my phone through a whole day and still ended up with low battery warnings at 4pm on some days.I already have a seperate battery but it is clumsy to carry that ( plus cable ) through the day and charging it each night required more organization than I was capable of . After researching all the alternatives I decided the Mophie Air was the best of the bunch available today , even though I had concerns about the possible drawbacks.I received my Mophie 2 weeks ago and I am very happy with it so far . I knew about the issues ahead of time so my expectations were set accordingly.What works : The form factor is great - it makes the iPhone chunky but guess what - it actually feels better this way and is easier to hold when in use ! Materials seem ok , the case does n't feel cheap and does n't have garish brand names emblazoned on it , just a nice low key `` mophie '' imprinted logo . Charge LEDs do the job . Case is snug but fits my 3GS OK and covers the whole phone back and top . Not sure how much protection it really provides but it has to be better than nothing.Battery Capacity : Not amazing but will recharge a dead phone to about 90 % which is more than enough for a long day ( or two short ones ) .Convenience : Perfect - always ready when you need it . Charging is simple , plug it in at night with one cable and by morning you have a fully charged phone and case ready for the day . To enable charging when you are low on juice just flick a small recessed switch and your phone is charging back to life , easy . Syncing works fine through the MicroUSB cable.Drawbacks : Cable - yes it 's a microUSB which means your docks wo n't work unless you slide the case off each time - I was n't really too bothered about this . Extra cables can be found online pretty cheaply.Mute Switch - you ca n't unmute with the case on , you need to slide the top off to get to the switch . Irritating but not a dealbreaker.Reception - I have n't noticed the big drop in signal strength others have reported - might be a slight reduction but nothing that has given me any trouble ( yet ? ) MicroUSB connector - people have complained that the connector breaks inside the phone after continued use - I have n't had any problems yet but I 'm keeping an eye open for this.Price - it 's pricy but if your iPhone is a primary tool for you then you 'll appreciate the convenience and the investment will be worth it.Best illustrations of how it has saved me already -1 ) Business call that went much longer than planned , battery was down to 7 % - flicked the charger switch mid-call and I was good to go for the rest of the call ( and day ) .2 ) Writing this review in Starbucks - 20 % battery warning just came up but I do n't care - it 's just time to get the Mophie going.Overall this has completely solved my battery anxiety and made my iPhone a dependable device all day - highly recommended.I just confirmed that Blackberry Micro USB data cables work fine with the Mophie ( they charge and sync ) and can be purchased very cheaply from Amazon .	-1
No wonder the price was so low , this battery pack is so bad that with the iphone battery fully charged and this pack fully charged , I can not get not even 5 hours of use out of the phoneI noticed it from the beginning I should have returned this item right away.The newtrent I used to have outlast this one here by far	-1
I bought this originally for the outrageous price of $ 90 , but thought it would be worth it if it got me through a full day of heavy use on my iPhone . The first case worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working ( the case would hold a charge , but not transfer any charge to my iPhone ) . I returned it ( in the same box as my roomates , whose mophie also stopped working at the same time ) and received a new one , no questions asked , which is nice . But the new one barely works at all . It extends the life of my iPhone battery for an hour or two but does n't charge the phone , and it does n't seem to work if my phone battery drops too low . For example , if my phone is at 20 % , I attach the case and where I would normally only have maybe 30 min of talk time , the mophie gets me 60 minutes , but then the phone dies , even though the mophie power meter says it has juice left . This has been a very disappointing product .	-1
First , be prepared to loose your signal . Second the case does not protect your phone very well . Buyer beware !	-1
You purchase a unit for extended battery life and if you purchase this for 3GS you will be disappointed . While the unit has a good finish I am careful with my stuff and especially anything with with Apple on it . I have superglued several parts on after moderate use . While it protects the phone well it is rather bulky . The battery after several complete charges looses I would say about 35 % of its ability to hold a charge . This is not expectable in my view . These companies put a list of call times and video etc however it is a deceive rating system . I am going to try the `` Third Rail System '' for a 4S . The main reason I would want to try this is because of its slim profile & smart battery system . While a little on the pricey on for its 1250 mAh swap-out-battery . You can stack them i such a way to get you a weeks charge . Granted unrealistic but these batteries have several functions that you need to follow-up on line .	-1

Mophie should be ashamed . This case does not protect the phone very well and you loose most of your signal while the battery case is on . Buyer beware !	-1
I used the original Mophie Juice pack with my 3G . I had it for 6 or 9 months & I wore it out until it would n't take a charge . The outer appearance deteriorated by then , but it performed to the end . I was perfectly satisfied . When I got the 3GS and the Juice Pac Air came out , I got one right away . I had it for 3 months & it 's busted . The cable had a problem so I got it replaced through the website . Today , the connector on the case itself no longer connects to the cable . I tried my new cable , my old cable & my wife 's cables & nothing . No lights , no iTunes , no phone vibrating , nothing . It 's been only 3 months . I do n't know if it 's the design , the build quality or the micro USB connector . ( the Mini USB connector was fine & tested for years so I do n't know why they changed it ) DO N'T BUY this battery case . Go back to the Juice Pack or wait for the next generation .	-1
I bought these to run with an 3rd gen iPod touch . They are relatively comfortable , although I would definitely prefer an ear bud . Problem with ear buds when you run is sweat makes them slip out , so this is a good alternative . The downside to these is that they do n't really get loud enough -- the volume control is kind of limited . Otherwise , if you need an inexpensive , wireless headset just to work out , I 'd recommend . If you 're looking for great sound for listening enjoyment , look elsewhere.Update : I had to return these headphones ; the volume control just stopped working altogether and I could never get the music to get above the external noise around me . Skip these ... there are better products out there ! I plan to get the Sony Ericsson Bluetooth ear buds ...	-1
The quality of these headphones is pretty cheap . The buttons are awkward , the power button is sometimes fickle and do n't let even the slightest bit of sweat or moisture hit them . Had them for about a month and they are completely useless now . Waste of money . Going to buy cheap ( yet more durable ) Rocketfish brand .	-1
I had these headphones since November 2012 , and over the time it has proven to be cheaply made , bends out of shape easily . On the up and up , sound quality is good .	-1
They work great but when using the buttons on the headphones it feels like they could fail at any given time . The buttons do work though and I 'm not going to judge them on what I think will happen . I 'll downgrade and explain why if I have an issue but for now they 're a good bang for the buck and it beats getting tangled up at the gym.Dropped from 4 to 3 stars because of short battery life and the foam keeps falling off.Edit : Do n't know why my last edit did n't stick , but they stopped working after about 3 months of occasional use . I was able to return them for a partial refund . Steer clear !	-1
This bluetooth headset has great sound for both calls and music . Worked with my iPhone 4S right out of the box , I did n't have to do anything extra to make it play music over the iPhone 's built in iPod . Have n't tested it with my iPad yet but I bet it 'll work fine . I did try for a longshot and connected it to my macbook pro , but no sound came out . Maybe there 's a trick to it . That would be a great bonus if it could do that ! It only gets 4 stars because I ca n't lay down in bed with it on . : ) UPDATE : The headset has started losing its shape and has become very uncomfortable to wear . The hard plastic that goes behind my neck twists up and wo n't stay `` even '' on both sides so I 'm constantly having to try and bend it back into shape . Do n't really wear them anymore because of this .	-1
I really liked these at first , the price is right , the styling is fine , the sounds is ok. Everything you would want from a cheap pair of wireless headphones.But they are just not made to take much abuse . I 've had them less than 2 months and already the volume button is broken ( I can only turn the volume down , not up , and half the time hitting up just turns it down so that now the volume is so low I ca n't actually hear anything through them ) . I suspected this would be the case since right from the start I could hear the buttons ( annoyingly ) rattle while running . Honestly the headphones are fine if there was just a more robust button design . Now comes the fun prospect of dealing with amazon and/or motorola to see if I can get them replaced ... UPDATE : called motorola and they 're sending me a new pair . I 'm somewhat doubtful that the new pair will last very long either but I suppose I 'll find out .	-1
Had these headphones for a year and then static started coming out of the left ear piece . So loud it is painful . even when turned off it keeps making static . Nothing I 've tried has rectified it . Guess it 's time for a new pair of headphones , which wo n't be Motorola .	-1
I 've had two pair of these now . When they work they are perfect for me , but after a few months both of them stopped working . I mainly use them while riding a bike , so maybe the sweat is the problem . When the first set stopped working , I thought I just did something . But now the second set stopped in the same manner .	-1
Sounds Quality - Only the right earpiece is equipped with base . The left sounds like a morning fart when turning it up . Sounds fair on a low to medium volume.Voice quality - have not tested yet , will update you on the receiving end of it.Connection - Easily picked-up by iphone4 . Just make sure wait for 7 secsProduct quality - fair for lightweight earpiece.Cables - Only comes with usb charging cable . Have to use iphone 110W female adapter . Freakin ' cheap companyManual - straight forward piece of paperCase - Feels like an egg tray quality with a zipper . Can probably hold 3 broken eggs insideValue - Might keep it for the price and i hate mailing it in return .	-1
The unit is very flimsy ; I 'm afraid it will break with even the gentlest handling . The on/off switch is small and easily blocked from view when turning the headset on or off . Other controls are equally inaccessible . The sound quality is very average.On the other hand , RF-MAB2 Bluetooth Stereo Headset by ROCKETFISH is an outstanding value . Superior sound quality , durable , and the controls are much more easily accessed than the Motorola unit . The fit is quite tight but with patient adjustment can be made acceptable . This unit is also available on Amazon .	-1
Problem 1 - I bought these because in the details it said it would pair with 2 devices at the same time . I followed the directions and paired it with my iPhone 4S and then turned them both off , turned the headphones back on and paired it with my iPad 2 . I then turned everything off . I turned my iPhone and then my iPad back on and finally the headphones and they would only connect with 1 device . I wanted to be able to watch videos on my iPad and still answer my phone with these . I could not do that.Problem 2 - So after this happend I decided to try it with just my iPhone and listen to music , the music sounded fine but when I made phone calls there was an echo and the person on the other end told me I sounded terrible . I tried restarting everything and still had the same problem.Problem 3 - After wearing these for about 2 hours my ears were killing me , they were very uncomfortable ! Needless to say I returned these the day after I got them .	-1
I 've used several brands of Stereo Bluetooth headsets from Jabra to Plantronics to Motorola . I was mostly obsessed with getting ear bud style bluetooth headsets and did not want to give the over the ear ones a try . I thought they would get more sweaty at the gym or cause me to feel uncomfortable with the bulk but I was wrong ! These light weight S305 's are fantastic . The sound is about as good as bluetooth headsets can get . I do 45 minutes to an hour of weight training and 30-40 minutes of cardio in these and I often forget I 'm wearing them.With my old ear bud style ones I would constantly have to re-adjust them during my workout . I would have a hard time skipping tracks and adjusting volume because the the buttons were so small and hard to use . With these S305 's the button placement is excellent and easy to use and the only time I have to adjust them is when I do incline bench press but even that got easier to deal with after a few workouts.I have taken a few phone calls with these and those sound great too . The other party can hear me clearly and I can hear them clearly . I will say that if you are outside taking a phone call and there is a some wind the other party will hear the wind noise and it can become annoying on longer calls . This is a minor complaint since I mostly use these for music and if I take a call with them I 'm usually at home not outside.Overall I highly recommend these Motorola S305 's . The price is excellent at $ 30-35 and they seem durable . I 've been using them for over a month now and I will not go back to earbud style headphones again.QUICK TIP : If you sweat in them DO NOT charge them right away . When you get home let them sit for several hours ( or overnight ) before you charge them . Charging them after you sweat in them is a great way to fry the battery and burn them out . The battery life is excellent and you should be able to get at least 3-4 workouts with them before they need charging.Edit : Well after 3.5 months the unit broke . The volume button stopped working on them . Too late to return them to Amazon but Motorola is going to replace them . I just have to pay to ship it back to them . If the replacement breaks I will probably look to buy the Kinivo BTH220 . They seem sturdier than these Motorola 's . I am a little disappointed that these do n't cut out any outside noise at all ( like zero noise cancelling ) . The foam pads barely touch my ears so I can hear all outside noise . The guy next to me was stomping as he ran on the treadmill and I could barely hear my own music .	-1
Really bad battery life , connection was lost more often that i liked . Will not buy this thing again . What 's more , i 'm not sure i will buy Bluetooth headsets again .	-1
Im not sure if the pair which I received became warped or if that is how they were intended to be designed , but they do not fit well at all . They wrap around the head as advertised , but the back of the wrap hits the bottom of my neck , and the earphones are not rotated as far as they should be . this causes the forward ( > > ) button to be not pointing forward towards my face , but pointing down towards my chin . This strange setup also causes the headphones not to sit flat against the ears , but are awkwardly angled slightly outwards.I really hope that this was just a defected pair that I received , but based on mine I would not recommend this product to anyone with a normally sized and shaped head . Maybe Shaq would like them .	-1
Weird it seems as if Motorola is buying stuff and placing their name on it and calling it good . These are horrible at reception , I could n't even put my phone in my pocket without having spotty coverage . ****I own another Bluetooth headset that I would recommend Rocketfish RF-MAB2 $ 60 at Bestbuy $ 35 on Ebay . Owned for more than 1 year , excellent range and battery life****	-1
After less than 3 months of use they quit working . I looked into fixing them , but seemed easier to just replace them . The sound was fantastic , and when they worked they were great for phone calls . Not good for fitness , at least not for me - too fragile . I did n't like how easy it was to hit the buttons on the side of the ear phones , so you could accidentally fast forward , re-dial , etc . They were nicely priced and I read others had much better luck than me , but I 'm done with them for now .	-1
When I first got this headset I was very pleased , but then I started having a lot of problems with the battery that do n't last long . Now it 's not working at all , every time I charge it , use it for a little while then turn it off , the next time I tried to use it , it 's dead and I have to recharge it again ... So basically now I have to charge it every time I want to use them ... I do n't recommend this product ... bad quality ...	-1
The headset is comfortable while wearing . Problem is that they lose signal a lot while using and every now and then break up .	-1
These headsets pair easily , and have good battery life . However Bass response is low unless you jack up the bass with an equalizer ( using it with Android ) and being a non adjustable behind the neck design , you ca n't enjoy them while laying down on a pillow as the ear pads will rise up above your ears . Next time I would get an over the head pair .	-1
These are extremely clever headphones . They cram many , many features into a tiny package . They are , unfortunately poor on two key counts if you 're interested in using them to listen to music . The first is that the bluetooth feature for listening to music just did n't work well and was easily disrupted , either by moving around in relation to the source of the bluetooth broadcast or , when using my iPad or iPhone , if I were using any other apps on the device.The comfort of these headphones was also poor and the behind the neck placement irritating if I were sitting . The headphones pinched too tightly on my head and the grip or tension was not adjustable . After a relatively short time , the pressure on my ears was unacceptably painful . The behind the head placement of the loop connecting the individual earpieces is nominally a good idea , but because the loop of the headset is fairly large , it sticks out behind and down the neck . This does n't work for sitting in a chair or reading propped up in bed - the headphones are jammed forward by the loop or levered up , depending on how the loop hits the chair or bedframe and pillow . Either way , not comfortable , not workable .	-1
I purchased these headphones because I am really hard on the corded kind , and I find myself needing to replace them every year or two . A bluetooth headset seemed like the way to go . Unfortunately , it did not turn out to be the case . Sound quality is decent , and charge time is okay , but sadly , this thing can not maintain the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone . Every few minutes , the connection weakens , and sound stutters and even cuts off for a few seconds . Given that I keep my phone in my shirt pocket , the distance from the phone to the headphones is less than 2 feet , yet the connection fails . Not what I 'd call a reliable product . I would definitely not buy this again . Total waste of money .	-1
This headset worked great for a couple of months . I was able to control my iTunes on my iPhone 4 . Unfortunately they stopped working for me . It may have been too much sweat/moisture as I was using them while running . I 'm not sure , but I 'm now in the market for another bluetooth headset , and I will not be getting these again .	-1
after a few months they stopped accepting the charge . The sound quality is good but i expected them to last longer	-1
I wanted a pair of behind-the-head headsets for comfort reasons . These fit okay , but the user ergonomics are not to my liking.The volume controls are not tactile marked : I ca n't tell when I am on the + or - volume controls by touch . And , to make matters worse , when the mode changes , so does the volume . These headphones are capable of a high level so you can unexpectedly wind up having your ears blasted - without , in my case , the means to quickly adjust the volume.I wanted to use these with Skype and have the freedom to walk away from the computer when necessary . You do n't get far with these : I managed about 10 feet away from the computer in repeated tests before the Bluetooth connection was lost.The audio feed from my music source did not shut off when I initiated a call . In fact , as soon as the call started ringing , the volume of the music shot up to its highest level.Overall , this unit offered the comfort level and fit that I was looking for - but none of the really useful things I need . Your experience may vary.Jerry	-1
i 've used about a dozen stereo bluetooth headsets . my stupid dog eats them somewhat regularly . these were ok , but subpar and not worth the price.this was my favorite of the 4 motorola stereo BT headsets i purchased over the years , although i found off-brand options that were better : Kinivo BTH240 Bluetooth Stereo Headphonei also used the s9 , s9hd , and s10 headsets from motorola . these were all ok , above average sound quality , but they would constantly come out my ears enough to lose all the bass response : plus if you 're wearing those in-ear designs while out walking you 're as good as deaf : at least with these over the ear ones you can hear the outside world if you keep the volume at a reasonable level .	-1
the cheap plastic band that goes behind your head is huge and sticks out like a wing behind your neck . if you look up , it hits your neck and moves the heaphones . the band is not adjustable - big design flaw.also , the max volume level is horrible - you can easily hear noise around you with it turned all the way up .	-1
I am shocked and dissappointed in the sound quality from these headphones ! They sound cheap and tinny . The device works fine and has a beautiful appearance , but they sound like something found in the dollar bin at Dollar General . I have the Motorola SD-10 bluetooth headphones , and love them . I ca n't believe the same company makes both . These are simply terrible !	-1
Bluetooth pieces are falling off the market like flies off a baker 's apron . But this piece is probably one of the worst sound quality devices you can wrap around your ears . The Bluetooth makes a very poor connection to your cell phone device and looses and regains connection strength as you are using it . The result is a very poor sound quality experience . Not recommended .	-1
Bad choice if you want to get them for music.Bad choice if you want to use this with your Sony Bluetooth supporting phone ( like Sony Walkman series . Any latest phone ) I understand that you dont expect them to do good as Bose in 30 bucks , but jWin comes in same price , but gives better quality.I think Motorola can never do good in this music earphones thing.With Sony phone ( & sometime with iPhone too ) , the quality was too bad.Sound was like was being interrupted every few seconds.Come on , we are in 2010 . Bluetooth should be no magic , should work ! !	-1
These were awesome headphones until the volume button snapped inside . Could no longer turn up the volume and rendered the headphones useless , as I managed to get them stuck all the way at the absolute lowest volume setting trying to get it to work again.Expected a lot more out out of a $ 50 product .	-1
I have purchased two sets of these and I would give the battery charge , ease of connection/use and range all an A++ rating . However , I was using these at the gym where I do sweat a lot . The first pair lasted me about 4 months but the second pair only about 60 days until they died . Only thing I can think of is the sweat is killing them ? ? Great if you want to use in office or sitting at home doing nothing but if you are looking for some you can use while working out/running I would like to another product it might be worth getting a new pair every 4 months but every 2 months ? More trouble than they are worth at that rate .	-1
You need an average cranium , the sound is not super , the microphone is tinny and people had a hard time hearing me . You can go a long way from the phone and retain connection though !	-1
I liked everything about this headset . Until I wore them to the gym and worked up a sweat . Everything was fine until I finished my workout and tried to turn them off . Nothing happened - held down the power button and they just kept blinking . I let them run out of power ( and dry out ) and charged them again . They worked fine for 30 minutes . Once I worked up a sweat , they started cutting in and out and finally just made a buzzing noise and would n't turn off . I let them dry out again and they worked fine for two days . Then I went back to the gym and sure enough , once I worked up a sweat they started cutting in and out and then started buzzing . I got so fed up that I stomped on them and threw the remains into the nearest trash can . I wish I had sent them back for a refund , but I lost my temper.In any case , they were excellent until they stopped working properly .	-1
I bought this headphones in January 2012 . It worked well for couple if month but then started bad times when my return window is closed . Automatically disconnected from the phone without a reason . Worked well with Skype sometimes . I need to connect the headphone then start the skype app in my iPhone and log-in . ( you need to follow this order ) . Then it 'll work for the first call I make . If I want to hang up and make another Skype call , then I have to disconnect the headset , log off from Skype and follow the above steps again . Finally , + volume controller stopped working . So I could n't use it anymore . Too bad !	-1
I decided to buy this headset , because it has over 1000 reviews , mostly positive . However , these are my points of assessment : Comfort : I do n't know what most people consider to be `` comfortable '' , but this set does not fit for me . It feels awkward , with its ark at the rear of my head , and it does not hug my ears snugly enough . When I lean back against my high sofa seat or pillows , the beam behind my head gets in the way and pushes the set off my ears , since it is not precisely snug around the rear of my head.I also wear reading glasses , and the bow of the set gets into a room crisis/conflict with the branches of my glasses right behind and above my ears . There is room for one of those , but not for the both.I wanted to use it for two things : as my speaker system for the laptop and at the same time , to use as the blue-tooth for my iPhone-4 . The sound quality for music and sound files played from my laptop is poor , compared to the Plantronics DSP 400 I have been using until now . For my iPhone , I tried to pair it 3 times . I turned it off , then on again , to be discovered . It signaled that it was paired for phone calls , but upon testing it by calling my husband 's iPhone-4 , I never got to hear anything in the headset . I had to turn to the phone 's speaker system instead . Maybe it needs that separate adapter that they also mention ( although they claim it works with the iPhone `` guaranteed '' .For all these poor performance reasons , it goes back into the box and returned for a refund .	-1
Pros : light weight , Micro USB charger , controls are easy to use.Cons : Uncomfortable - The loops that go around your ear are hard plastic and dig into the side of my head , I wear a 7-1/4 hat size . The loop that goes behind my head sticks straight out about an inch off the back of my head so with a high back chair I 'm always bumping the back of the headset.Does not work as advertised - This is supposed to connect to two devices at a time but it does n't work with a phone and computer or two phones . Even if I set the phone for calls and the computer for audio it still wo n't stay connected to both at the same time which is really disappointing since that 's exactly why I got it .	-1
I used these for about a month of running , during which I ran about 50 miles . The sweat and light mist from that month ( never did I run in the rain ) caused these to go out . Do n't buy these with the expectation they are even somewhat rugged . I do n't know what else somebody would use them for if not exercising ...	-1
I purchased the Motorola S305 in January 2013 . In November 2014 the battery no longer holds any charge . I do n't think I ever got & # 34 ; 6 hours & # 34 ; of use out of it . The most was a little over two hours . In the past 3 months the unit was running one hour at most , and steadily declined . It got down to 15 minutes , now no more . Less than two years.Phone call quality is fair to poor . Indoors in a quiet place call quality is good . Fair means that people on the other end of the line might mention about the call quality and background noise . Poor means people say they ca n't understand the call.I 'm not a great judge of sound quality , my hearing is not good , I do wear behind the ear hearing aids at times . One thing I like is that this headset does fit with the hearing aids on or off . And I also wear glasses . The unit fits with or without any combination of glasses , hearing aids . Music , speech and other audio sound very good with or without the hearing aids -- the unit sounds much better that sound from the various Thinkpad and Mac laptops I use . After an hour+ with the hearing aids , glasses however my ear tips do feel a pinch.The headphones fit my big 7 5/8+ size head . I have worn them for intense workouts in the gym and during active yard work on hot days . A lot of sweat does n't seem to bother them.I have had no problem syncing these with my Android phones , and with my Panasonic Bluetooth DECT 6.0+ home wireless phone base station . I also have used these iPod Nano 6 , with a bluetooth adaptor . The Nano was only able to drive the micro adaptor for a little over a hour though . Functionality with the nano and the adaptor was good , pause , fwd/rev , all controllable via the headphone buttons . Syncing with my Macbook Pro was tricky and in the end not really reliably functional mainly due the Mac 's poor Bluetooth handling of units like this headset with a mix of both Stereo-playback and phone-headset bluetooth protocols.I like the buttons all on the right ear piece . It took a few days of use to get the button positions down , but now I find they come easily , naturally.I have just ordered a different manufacturer 's model as a replacement .	-1
After reading all the good reviews on Amazon , I finally decided to buy this headphone because I have an iTouch ( with the latest 3.1.2 firmware ) and I wanted a wireless headphone for the freedom that it offers . I got it in a day after ordering using Amazon 's prime shipping . Charged the headphone completely ( until the green light came ) and also paired easily with my iPod and also my laptop . But very soon into my hearing experience , I started getting pauses between listening to my iTouch . The audio lagged so many times even after a full charge that I was so disgusted and I am returning back this product . Also the ear fit is very uncomfortable and I doubt if anyone can wear this product for 30 mins or more . All in all , a very poor product that has disappointed me .	-1
I was very disappointed . This item did not work right out of the retail box . The charge light came on red and never changed to green . The headphones would not power on . I was looking forward to these . I processed a refund ( and was grateful for the Amazon process ) . I will not reorder because I see from other reviewers , and from somebody I know that bought the same headphones , that the overall product quality is poor and my experience was not uncommon .	-1
I sleep fine in any bed , with ( or without ) any pillow . I never send back dishes at restaurants . I 've never had a bad taxi driver . I 've never cried over a haircut , or even withheld a tip . I 'm really not a whiny person.But these headphones sure as hell do n't fit my head comfortably . The earpiece covers my ears at a strange angle . The plastic bar piece that goes over the ear is bulky and uncomfortable . The back part that 's supposed to `` hover '' over your neck is weird fitting and looking.Maybe if I had giant ears that stuck out from my head and pointed forward ...	-1
These little headphones do sound very good for inexpensive phones , good strong bass and clear treble . Being free of connecting wires seems wonderful , I must admit . The fit is very comfortable for me also . I was dissapointed that with my new 3rd generation iPod Touch 64 Gb , the phones will not advance to the next song or go back to the previous song with the push controls as they are supposed to do . I later found that the issue here is that Apple does not support the S305 's particular Bluetooth profile ( AVRCP ) . Neither will my iPod recognize the phones built in microphone for voice recording as a result of this same issue . The phones themselves are great , but for anyone expecting to use them with their iPods , this is definitely a problem to consider .	-1
The Motorola S305 surprisingly does not sound as good as the Kinivo BTH220 ( also sold under other names ) . The Kinivo also consistently had an easier time connecting to my iphone . However , the Motorola S305 looks and feels better than the Kinivo , and appears to be more durable.I would have given the S305 4 stars , but after three months of ownership , the + volume button has completely broken . The - button works fine . I experienced a similar problem with another Motorola model , but that problem took over a year to manifest . No , I did not drop or abuse these headphones . I hardly even used the volume buttons since controlling the volume with my phone is usually sufficient.These headphones are going in the trash .	-1
I was excited opening the package . After reading the directions , I plugged the unit in to charge , and waited , and waited , and waited . The unit never charged . Sent it back . Gave it one star - bad quality control - disappointed .	-1
The head set band twists in the back and the ear cups separate away from my ears . The band also goes behind the ears and presses into the back of my ears and is very uncomfortable . This one may have been molded really bad . It keeps disconnecting from the phone and the phone is only 2 feet away . Keep shopping around .	-1
CONS : These headphones HURT to wear . The reason being is there is no padding whatsoever on the part that actually rests on your ears . The best way I can describe it ( which you can not see in the picture ) is imagine a long rectangular piece of plastic , now fold that in half so you now have a long u-shaped piece of plastic . Now form that piece into the curve shape you see in the picture . Now strap this around your ears with the weight of both sides ( granted they are pretty lightweight ) supported solely by the tops of your ears . Keep in mind , you have a two plastic edges sitting on top of each ear . After about 15 minutes of running I have to take them off . No amount of re-positioning helps . A better design would have made the headband part a solid cylinder so there are no edges , or placing a small section of padding on the part that actually rests on the ears.PROS : For the money , they sound like you would expect . I have no complaints in that department . For my 2nd Gen IPOD touch , the volume works , play/pause , but the track forward/reverse buttons do not work.All in all , I wish I would have gotten something else : (	-1
Poor battery life ... it 's supposed to be a extended high capacity battery but the life of the battery was just like my REGULAR battery that came with the phone , it sucks . DO NOT BUY ! ! HOW DO I SEND THIS BATTERY BACK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I wanted to make my G1 last as long as possible as it is a great phone . The stock battery was only giving me about 6 hours on a full charge so I bought the extneded battery . It definitely works . I was getting 10 to 12 hours out of it , with moderate use ( texting and emails ) . It does make the phone slightly bigger , but overall , it was worth the extra battery life . ***EDIT*** 09/09/2011As of this week the battery stopped holding a charge . For a few days it would not charge about 63 % and this morning it said fully charged and when I got to work the battery was down 40 % . Bummed that it only worked for a few months .	-1
Used this device successfully for about two weeks before the prongs broke off the end that attaches to the phone . And unfortunately , I am a couple of days passed the `` return '' period so I am out of luck . Buyer beware ! Thankfully , it was only $ 5 .	-1
It is supposed to have an auto shut-off when the phone reaches its full charge . I plugged it in at night , and my phone showed it was charging , and then went to bed . The next morning , my phone was dead . It had lost 30 % charge overnight , not charging . The next night I plug it in with this charger , and it does n't work ! Total garbage . And I bought two of them , no less ! Maybe the other one will work ? I 'm not holding my breath .	-1
Worked good , but it broke after a few uses . The cable would not communicate to computer ( ertracted ok ) . I like to praticality .	-1
The tool does the job but it is not the original sim card tray tool by Apple . It is a cheap cutout . Do not buy if you want the original one by Apple . If you do n't care to scratch the aluminum coating on the phone by inserting this tool into your phone then buy it . If you want to keep your phone in pristine beautiful condition , do n't waste your time with this cheap product .	-1
This pin is super fragile ! Forget about it being metal and all . Once I entered it to the sim card area to remove the sim card tray that thing just snapped ! It 's a complete waste of money and time !	-1
the iphone pin I recived was bent all up.When i got the pin it was hanging outside the package.The package was open with many holes in it .	-1
The LG enV touch is an awful phone . The accessories work but it 's just such an awful phone , everything that goes with it deserves a one star rating .	-1
As soon as I plugged this charger in the wall it made a spark . Thank God I did n't blow up but something could 've happened to my phone . This charger is dead !	-1
Im not a fan ... i run outside & it always falls down , & I cant wear it with my sunglasses ... It does work great as far as the bluetooth & the sound all work correctly	-1
It worked ( past tense ) good for a while ( not perfect , but good enough to deserve an A- ) The buttons were great . The comfort was very good . The sound was good enough to get me through my workouts ( I 'm no sound pro ) .At the 6 month mark , the device kept beeping as if I were holding down the volume up key . Yes , I turned it off & on , reset it etc . I turned it off and left it alone for a few hours . It stopped doing it for a little while ( about 20 min ) and then started again . Every time I used it there after , it would start beeping incessantly after a short unknown time interval.When you read the reviews on this item , take note of how long the person has owned the device . I do p90x workouts , so I frequently sweat quite a bit . I wipe the device off when finished . Item has never been submerged , etc . This device , in my books , is only sweat proof for about 6 months.Judging from the reviews of the s10-hd , it 's an undesirable product . People who owned the S9 and went to the s10 said it was worse in almost all ways . Based on my experience with Motorola support on this device , I want nothing to do with them or their products.Support has been pretty bad . I attempted to do it online and thought I was making headway.The rep chat ended by telling me they 'd be emailing me further directions to mail it in ( after attaching the receipt to the chat ) .An email did arrive requesting the receipt again . I replied and gave the receipt . No response from them.Emailed another response with the receipt attached . No response.Did another online chat and jumped through hoops of questioning again . At the end of it the rep told me to call Motorola , gave a phone and case number.Called them . After being on hold for quite a long time , talked to an agent ( who put me on hold a few times ) and they said they 'd be emailing me directions for sending it in . That 's where it is.It 's taking me hours to resolve something that could have been resolved in 10-30 minutes.Why ca n't they resolve this with one agent , one session ?	-1
Bought from Verizon store about 2 years ago . Had been working great , then suddenly I could hardly hear music through the left ear..then not at all . Then it would n't stay synced to my LG EnV Touch..rendering it totally worthless after paying well over $ 70 for it at the time . Very disappointing . It seems these Bluetooth devices do n't last very long . Maybe I should be happy I got 2 years , after looking at some of the reviews for any Bluetooth music player/hands-free mic device .	-1
This headset has no mic and the sound quality is very average however for the price it 's not a bad deal .	-1
I 'd give 0 stars if I could - these arrived dead - I plug them in and all they do is make a lot of scratching sounds , no sound comes out and people ca n't hear me ( mic issue too ) .Ca n't recommend .	-1
Not sure what people are raving about . The sound is decidedly low end and the ear buds run small -- like they were made for small women or children . I can not get good bass response from these as a result . Still , the price is low so I ca n't complain too much . Fair is fair .	-1
Palm dies and all of these licked its wounds and dies with the Palm , I do n't think any other phone compary tried to do this , even though it was a cool concept . But the damn cover would always peel in few months so good they are gone !	-1
It did n't work . I tried and tired and tired to get it to work with no luck . Dont waist your money .	-1
The charger dock requires additional pieces in order for it to function ... Not sure I 'll ever use it . Consider the required replacement back for the pixi is cheap and fails to meet the quality of the phone .	-1
I purchased this charging dock , went throught receiving the wrong product and having to wait to receive the correct item at a later date . After all was said and done , the dock does not work . I have half a mind to think the seller sent me a faulty dock because I complained about receiving the incorrect propduct to begin with . Really frustrated at this point . Not going to bother complaining again , as it has gotten me nowhere . UGH ! ! I hope this seller enjoys my donation ...	-1
I got this for my SGS3 . I picked up the Samsung back cover on e bay ... .this works fine with it , but the phone ( with out a case on ) barely stays in place . You have to get it just right for it to start charging and it is very touchy ... u move it the slightest , it stops working . The sloped design of this thing is makes it more difficult than a flat surface.O , did I mention it wo n't work with even a slim rubber case on the phone . I have this case : GreatShield Guardian S Series Slim-Fit S-Line Design TPU Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 - BlackMight as well just plug the phone in if I have to go through the hassle of removing my case.I assumed that this would come with the cable and wall plug you need to actually use it ... .but no ... this is the DOCK ONLY ! ( the seller has since added this info into the title of the listing ) You must have a micro usb cable with a very thin head , because the `` tunnel '' in the back of this dock that the cord goes in is very narrow . Lucky , one of my older Samsung phones cable was small enough ... .and I have my own usb charger ... .but no indicator lights on the dock ... I found a much better solution : Qi wireless Charger receiver pad for Samsung Galaxy S3 S9300Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - RedI can confirm that these 2 products work perfectly with my slim case on the phone . The Nokia pad is a tad smaller than the S3 , but it sit on there much better than the palm touchstone .	-1
I had no chance to use it because it is the charging dock only ! It comes with no USB cable whereas I found most USB cable will be too big to insert in the dock .	-1
Plugged it in and did not work . Did not bother trying to figure out which from the shipment was broken ( i.e. , stone or back ) . I 'm sure it would have been great had it worked .	-1
this seller is selling junk ! ! ! the battery your looking at must be a D grade unit or the rejects because they charge all the way up then discharge in 14 hours and for some reason get very hot .	-1
I got this thing after I saw it heavily advertised as solid protection for a phone 's glass . I used it and must say that it is no better than the one or two dollar protectors . It wrinkled , was filled with bubbles and gets dirty very easily . Despite repeated efforts to remove them , this thing had more bubbles than a bubble bath . I would not recommend it , plus it 's pricey !	-1
Do n't waste your money on this `` lifetime replacement '' as you can get beeter protectors for a lot cheap prices . Most screen protectors usually last the life of the phone anyway .	-1
Concept was great but tad heavy in the ears , would not stay on . Also , it does not work w/ the iPhone-my ears were almost blasted off when I tried them . I am , frankly , shocked that S/E would make such a cool headset and not have it work w/ many phones , especially the iPhone . It may work well for other devices ... I can not determine the possibility .	-1
Nice looking , small and light weight.Average sound and over-priced.You CAN NOT adjust the volume from a iPod Touch or iPhone . This is a big , big minus.I do not recommend this item . There are better choices out there .	-1
I absolutely love this battery . I 've recently been having problems with my smartphone battery dying by mid-day ( long story ) while I 'm out and about with work . I 'm not near a electrical outlet most of the time so I decided to give this battery a shot . I was able to use my phone continuously all day long with it plugged into the battery pack and did n't even drain half of the juice from it . And all of that for less than $ 50 was a nice bonus.Now the unit is n't perfect . My only gripe with it is that the LED lights displaying it 's charge level only illuminate when the battery itself is being charged ( while plugged into the wall , for example ) not while it 's charging a device . It would be nice to know how much longer the battery can charge your device . But I was still willing to rate it 5 stars because of how portable it is ( fits in a dress shirt pocket ) . I 've very happy with my purchase . I was considering purchasing a similar Energizer unit for about the same price but it was only 5000mAh.Pros : - tremendous amount of charging power- very portable ( small for the amount of power it provides ) - works with any smartphone that can charge from USB- can charge two devices at once- has a 2.1amp port for charging tablets and phones very fastCons : - battery meter does n't display how much juice the batter has left while charging your deviceEdited 5/24/2010 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I 'm disappointed to report that the battery has given up the ghost after only a year of light use ( used it maybe 20 times for trips ) . It will still take a charge ( battery shows that it 's full ) but it will no longer charge any other devices . I thought maybe it was a faulty cable but buying another one did n't correct it . And there is absolutely no tech support available anywhere for New Trent products from what I can tell . I was expecting more . Decided to buy a 10,000mAh Anker ( Anker Astro3E 10000mAh High Capacity Power Bank Pack Portable External Battery Charger for iPhone 5 , 4S , 4 , iPad 4 , 3 , 2 , Mini , iPods ; Samsung Galaxy S4 , S3 , S2 , Note 2 ; HTC One , EVO , Thunderbolt , Incredible , Droid DNA ; Motorola ATRIX , Droid ; Google Nex ... ] ) to replace it .	-1
The case itself is nicer than the picture*does the job protecting the iPhone*it is elegant lookingBUT . This why only 2 STARS.The top closure flap has a very STONG Magnet . Usually the magnet is only in the inside to keep caese closedBut this one , the magnet is also in the outside Which could damage other electronics specially car keys and remote controlOne more thing . You must remove the front cover to attach the phone USB Which is not convenient and if one is not careful the top latch can touch the phone and cause mayor damageThe magnet is so STONG that my teaspoon was attached to my phone caseSo I can not recommend . And if I could would send it backI have glued a piece of Velcro So it will do for a while . But it does not look as nice	-1
I purchased this because I am simply tired of having literally dozens of old cell phone spare batteries for phones I no longer use lying around . Plus , my new phone ( Droid Razr ) has a fixed battery like the iPhones do , so extra batteries were n't an option . I occasionally travel long distance by air , and needed enough juice to keep my movies and music going for 20 or more hours of heavy usage . Finally , I HATE being half way through a movie when a battery dies and you have to swap the spare -- an external battery takes care of that.I purchased this particular model becuase I had a chance to look at the IMP50D . The IMP50D I received was defective , so I decided to go with the IMP70D trading the extra size for for the 40 % increase in juice . As far as build quality goes , the unit is very solid , and very professional looking . The USB output port is a little on the loose side , but connects and charges just fine . As for charging , the micro USB plug for power in is nice , as it is the same plug my phone uses.Keep in mind I originally bought this for air travel . Since getting my new phone , and playing with it way too much , I 've found this charger has been a life saver when I get a late afternoon or evening call . If the battery is burnt down , I can quickly grab the IMP70D , plug it in , and take the call . HOWEVER ... The IMP70D should have enough juice to fully charge my Razr at least 3 times , if not more . I have been able to reproduce this problem : Either the battery pack does not have the advertised capacity , or it is unable to hold a charge . I should be able to fully charge my 1780mAh cell phone battery fully at least 3 if not more times . I am averaging less than two . To make matters worse , after one charge , the LED indicator will show the pack has 3 out of 4 LEDs , indicating a decent charge . I check this by briefly turning the pack on , then making sure it is shut off . The very next use , I ended up with one blinking LED -- indicating the pack was exhausted . I had the exact same issue with the IMP-50D , in that it died after one full recharge , well short of the stated capacity.For the size , the awkwardness of the product , I was expecting something that did what it is supposed to . I am only giving this two stars because I got it on sale , and it does work somewhat . But this is one heck of a brick to carry around and only get 1.5-2 charges out of .	-1
Large ear piece did not fit in my ear . Very uncomfortable . Had a difficult time pairing this item with my phone . Recommend that you keep looking .	-1
This antenna will not work with the Virgin Mobile WiFi , even though it says it will work with all cellular networks . The Virgin mobile device has the antenna outputs on the Sierra Wireless , but an external antenna it is not supported . The only thing you can use is a cradle that they sell , as far as I have been able to find out.I paid an exorbitant amount for shipping from this seller and ended up returning it and had to pay for more shipping . I lost $ $ on the deal and it did n't work . I am sticking with Amazon Prime on everything from now on .	-1
I dont know what happened to mine but it got a crack in it and the plastic disinegrated on me after about 6 hours of use out in the sun . Also it was very uncomfortable , my ears hurt for a day afterwards after wearing it for that long .	-1
The product is fine . I just hate it when rinky dink sellers advertise cheap products one way , then disregard their descritption and what was actually ordered - just sending you `` whatever they have lying around . '' I ordered 1 White and 2 Black cables . I chose this seller because they , supposedly , had the cables in black . They sent me 3 White ones along with the packing slip that showed my correct 1WH/2BL order . They know 99 % of the time you wont return it , because it only costs a buck or two .	-1
It works , but I have a new-style Apple bumper on my iPhone and a silicone case on my iPod . I have to take the cases off of both to get this cord to plug in .	-1
This product claimed it was a charger for iPhone 3gs . However it was not compatible with the phone , because it did not work at all !	-1
The price is great the delivery was o.k . Everything was adequate . Just one small problem the plug was just a fraction too wide to fit into my 32GB 3GS . Even if you squeeze the insert pins , it just does not fit . Too cheap to do anything with so it goes to the landfill .	-1
This case was TERRIBLE ! Very flimsy , very pretty , very useless . I was glad that I paid next to nothing for it because it was one of the cases that made me the most unhappy . I am not a fan of cases that cover any amount of the front of the phone . While this did n't cover too much of it , the poor construction would n't allow the case to actually snap closed around the phone . I 'm not sure if it was broken in shipping , or production , but by the time it got to the end user the product was useless .	-1
Pretty phone caes however , the paint started peeling within the first two weeks of owning it . Basically you get what you pay for .	-1
The fit was great , very lightweight and comfortable . But it stopped working after a couple of months . I have been through so many of these that I 'm going to have to go backed to wired and I hate that .	-1
I put it on a couple of Samsung cellphones and a digital camera screen and the stuff did n't stay on for all that long . I never have tried the stuff again , but I will give it a second chance .	-1
I have purchased a similar item . Was hoping this would be the same . But no luck . I wanted it to hold my iphone in the car . It is not strong enough . the Other item I purchased was strong enough to hold with the metal piece even under the case . But this one is not even strong enough to hold the phone on its own . I should of returned it as soon as I got it . Very disappointed i ordered the wrong one ! .	-1
What a piece of crap ! ! ! ! ! Magnet could barely hold a pencil let alone a heavy iphone 5 . If I could rate this product a half star that would be touch much credit . Do not purchase this product .	-1
The product is useless . It 's so tiny for big size phone.I do n't even know how this works . The metal plate is too thick to put inside of phone case and the power of magnet is too weak.Did n't want to bother return it only because it 's a few bucks .	-1
The T5 screwdriver did no work at all . It was as if the screw I was trying to turn was completely rounded , but it was n't . So I bought a much higher quality brand and it worked no problem . The screwdrivers are complete junk so do n't waste your money . The plastic tool did work okay , but it 's basically ruined after one use .	-1
product is of very deficient quality , the screwdrivers did n't last the first screw before the heads got damaged , it was a cheap product and a waste of money as well , DONT BUY IT ! ! ! ! !	-1
Rather worthless , A torx driver too small to fit anything on & # 34 ; most of phone & # 34 ; , a tiny phillips driver that 's totally useless on & # 34 ; most of phone & # 34 ; a guitar pick ( really ! ! ) two plastic prybars that might have a use , and a suction cup with a keyring attached .	-1
I did this as an add on to some things that I was buying for my phone . When I say it I thought it would be good to have in case I every needed to get into repairing my phone in a major way . Put the order in got an email saying it has shipped and 6 weeks later still no tool I also did n't receive another part of the group of things that I ordered so I would not recommend this or the seller ever at this time .	-1
It would be wiser to spend just a little more money and get a good and sturdy stylus . I do n't recommend .	-1
i do n't really hate this at all , and i am sure it will be a great deal . but i have n't received it yet . i am looking forward to receiving it	-1
These styli will not work on a matte anti glare screen protector . I like to protect all my electronics with a screen protector and these styli DO NOT WORK on a screen protector . I have not tried them on a glossy screen protector . The tips are very cheap to touch and they are worth the amount I bought them for and nothing more . I felt like I just thew three bucks into the toilet and flushed it down . Do yourself a favor and get a better stylus by paying a little more . I guess I was just greedy when I thought I was getting 3 great styli for a cheap buck and a half .	-1
Got here quick but the tips did n't work well through my otter box case and had to glue tips in as they kept falling off	-1
I used one to power my Sandisk Sansa E280 . It failed within two days -- less than two hours of use . I sent it back and got another , which failed again within two days . What a piece of junk . The Sansa does n't even draw that much power , and my old non-low-profile has powered it for years .	-1
Bought this to pack in my travel bag for use in rental cars because of how small it is . But I must say it is nearly impossible to remove . I installed it in a Hertz rental , a Mazda 3 series I think , and it was nearly impossible to get out . Working at it with the car key at an angle and turning , pulling , turning , pulling I managed to get it out after about 5 minutes of work and some scraped knuckles . I think this is probably great for a permanent install in your own vehicle ( though you might not care how small it is then , and of course there are 2-port high power chargers that are almost as small you might want instead ) . For travel its a bust .	-1
Micro auto chargers commonly do n't maintain good contact with cigarette lighter socket . this one is no exception . i have to check the indicator light frequently to ensure my device is being charged . Consider its high price , i do not recommend this unit .	-1
Recommend that no one buy this product that was made in China.Now I know why it only cost me $ 0.01 , even though shipping cost me $ 4.28.I only used it once and it did n't even charge my phone ; instead it drained my phone 's battery.Worst of all , the device smells like a burnt electrical wire . It was very hot to the touch when I unplugged it.It is quite possible that if I left the device plugged in longer , it would have started a fire.Now , I have to start looking for another one , one that wo n't burn up with one use.And , one that will actually charge my phone battery.If shipping charges were refundable , I would return the defective device .	-1
I purchased this from AlernativeWireles.com for my Motorola Droid 2 Global . I could barely get the phone in & out . Wayyyy too tight . The second time I extricated the phone , all the stitches on the side ripped . Very poor quality and does not fit Droid 2 Global as stated in description .	-1
I 'm not sure if the seller is aware that the material is not leather ; I found out the hard way when I used a lighter to burn off some loose thread . Despite the false description , I 'm not completely disappointed with this purchase . I 've looked at quite a few case with similar style , and the reason I chose this one is : it covers the corners , the flap is smaller than some of the ones I considered , and the over all look is simple but elegant . Would I have made the purchase even if I knew it was n't leather ? As long as it 's under ten dollars ( including shipping ) . FYI , it is very roomy for my 4th gen iPod Touch before I put a shell on it , but now it fits perfectly -- just snug enough that the iPod wo n't slip out .	-1
It is a P.O.S . Do n't waste your money . I gave it 2 stars because it had a pretty design . That is all it is good for .	-1
This is a very pretty cover and seems to be decent quality for the price . I like the fact that is has sort of a & # 34 ; suede & # 34 ; type feel to the outside so you wo n't drop it very easily . However , it does n't fit my Verizon iPhone at all- too small . Keep looking if you have that phone so you wo n't be disappointed . I will toss this one as it is n't worth bothering to return it .	-1
So very disappointed . The item arrived with one of its corners already broken ( missing a piece of it , which was not in the package ) . The cover is actually thick , it 's not slick as it seems to be in the picture . It 's made of a cheap material and makes the iPhone so much larger than what it is without this cover . In fact I believe that if it falls down , the cover will click open and will not protect the phone at all , so what 's the point ? Look for something else !	-1
A clip brok off within the first week I had it on . Useless after that since it wo n't stay closed . You get what you pay for . It was pretty while I had it .	-1
I am bummed because this case was super cute and I really liked it , but it fell like a foot and a half and broke and would nolt snap back together . I only had like two weeks .	-1
I did n't like this case at all but sold it on FB to try to get my money back sorry .	-1
Do not buy ! It would n't fit on my phone at all . Just a waste of money since you ca n't use it .	-1
It worked for a couple days , before starting to go in and out , then I noticed the smell of smoke . I unplugged it immediately and threw it in the trash . Do n't buy this product , it 's a possible fire hazard . Glad I didnt have it plugged in at night while I was asleep or while I was out it could have caught on fire !	-1
I do n't think this was constructed to actually charge 2 items at once . Just because it has the 2 usb slots does n't mean it can tolerate the juice . My gave out soon after purchase .	-1
Charger will charge a tablet and something small , but not an S4 and Galaxy Tab 2 10 '' . It will charge one or the other , but for that I have the chargers that came with my devices ... Overall : If you have small , older devices then this will probably work for you , otherwise pay more money for enough ampage .	-1
I would suggest not buying this . It does n't supply a good amount of power to two devices . I would spend the extra to get one that does .	-1
I thought it was great , I did n't even use both ports but then after two days of using ... it did n't work anymore.Seller : Importer520	-1
I bought this for traveling to charge two phones . At first it would work with my iPhone & old work flip phone- IF I plugged the iPhone in first . It would not work with two iPhones . Now about a year later it hums- makes a constant buzzing noise even with only one phone plugged in . But t was cheap so o well .	-1
This item failed on first use . When I opened it up ( I 'm an electrical engineer ... I had to open it , did n't I ? ) I found a decent circuit board , average components and the worst soldering job ever . What failed ? The wires that were soldered to the back of the steel plug blades were cold soldered and came apart . Plus the blades were held in place with a friction fit which also failed , leaving exposed metal in the socket when the plug came apart . Construction is so bad that I estimate that the electrical integrity is likely just as bad and may actually harm delicate electronics like cell phones . Be careful and avoid this one ! ! ! !	-1
Fair car charger for my 3GS . Nice extendable cord.It charges iPhone 4 and 3GS correctly BUT the USB port does n't work .	-1
My phone crashes constantly with this battery.When I tried to get a replacement , seidio gave me the runaround and has refused to issue an RMA . My last two emails have been ignored .	-1
The cover and battery came new as listed , however once I inserted the replacement battery and tried to put on the cover that came with it , I immediately started having problems . First of all , the battery cover wont properly latch into the phone and from time to time it will actually come off . Second thing I noticed was , the battery life of my Palm Pre Plus Was only ever so slightly extended and I mean it when I say , it was hardly noticeable.For the extra bulk it makes , that in its self is not worth the extra 30 minutes of talk time it gives . But the major problem I have over all other problems I listed is that , the replacement battery charges poorly to say the least . Not only does it take forever to charge when not in use , but when I use the Mobile Hotspot feature on my Palm Pre Plus , it drains the battery extremely fast . So upon realizing this , I started plugging my phone into my home charger , however I found that even when it is plugged in , the battery still drains ! I have sense boxed the big bulky worthless battery , bought some car chargers and switched back to the original battery and cover . Spend the extra money on a better quality battery , I wish I had ! ! !	-1
UPDATE : I found a method at precentral to determine the actual battery capacity as identified by the manufacturer . It turns out this battery only has a capacity of 2300mAh and I am feeling very ripped off . I also have another battery from this brand and it is also showing itself to be mislabeled . I will be complaining to Siedio and posting back here if/when they make it right.It still gives me much better life than my standard battery , but if they continue to mislabel them I am forced to recommend the other brands available on Amazon and not anything from Siedio . This explains why I was barely getting twice the life when I should be getting at least 2.3x Grrrr.I love my Pre+ . No one does contacts and calendar better than Palm . No one ever has , no one is now , and perhaps no one ever will . But , the Pre uses the same battery as the Centro and battery life is terrible . I spent my first day doing nothing but internet and appstore stuff , and I got about 5 hours of life from the stock battery . Palm should be ashamed of that - I get a lot more than 5 hours from my notebook PC ! So , this is about 2.3 times the capacity of the standard battery , so it should get you through until evening before you need a recharge . If you do n't use it for more than a phone , you should be able to talk for a week on one charge.This is a great choice if you just want capacity . It comes with a nicely finished back cover that is actually easier to take off or put on than the stock cover.Two problems that you should consider:1 ) It does n't work with the Touchstone charger . I did n't think that would be a problem because I did n't even buy one . Then I tried the Touchstone . They are the coolest thing ever . Sure the wireless charging and intelligent behavior changes when it is on the Touchstone are nice . But , I 'm impressed because I can stick in on my dashboard or console and I have the equivalent of a car kit . So much better than having it slide around , or having to look down to dial . I 've ordered the smaller Seidio 1350MAh battery that fits in the standard cover so I can have 17 % more battery and use the Touchstone when I 'm on those long drives . I would give this battery 5 stars if they had an option for a Touchstone back plate . I 'd be willing to pay $ 25- $ 30 for it , too . Hopefully there is no technical reason why they ca n't make that for this battery . If you do n't care about Touchstone support , this wont bother you.2 ) It makes your phone much thicker . Not a problem for me , and it actually makes it easier to type on the keyboard . But , it goes from being `` Droid thin '' to 3/4 '' thick . That 's thicker than the 1st-generation iPod and about 50 % thicker than a Blackberry Curve . If you are looking for razor thin , you need a battery that works with the stock cover . If you only care about long life , this this is great.There are other batteries that are even bigger , but they are more than twice the price . This hits the right mix of capacity and size for those that can live with a thicker phone . If those two items do n't bother you , this is a great battery for you , and at a great price.Oh , several have mentioned problems with being loose fitting . That has apparently solved , because this fits as well as the stock battery . You should ignore those complaints .	-1
I dont usually get expensive accessories , but I decided to splurge on something nice for my new Palm Pre.Unfortunately you do not get what you pay for , the tabs that hold the case onto the phone broke after a month of regular , well cared for use , so now the expensive case does not stay on the phone and is worthless . Save your money .	-1
This case has many 5-star reviews . I suspect the reviews were written soon after the user got the case , put it on the Pre , and was impressed with the fit , finish , the attractive minimalist design , matte finish , and that it 's the only case that still allows you to charge via touchstone . I give it one star b/c what good is a case that you wo n't be able to use in a month ? One of the main reasons I bought this case is b/c of the high praise from pre cen tral ( seemed like everyone 's standard case there ) and the fact it 's touchstone capable . If you have a Sprint Pre , you know that the touchstone back is not included unlike the Verizon Pre Plus ( edit 5/17/2010 : Pre Plus will be avail for AT & T ; and it will include touchstone back and the charger ! Sprint continues to fail by by selling the original Pre , not Pre Plus , and without any accessories , yet it 's still $ 150 in many cities ! ) . I thought Seidio 's back can replace Palm 's touchstone back and it was only after I received the package that I discovered that I needed to buy a separate touchstone case ( another $ 20 ) . Side note : these accessories can cost some good change - $ 26 for Seidio case , $ 35 for touchstone charger , and another $ 20 for touchstone back . This is after having just spent $ 1 30 on a new Pre at Radio Shack with a 2 year contract . If you 're new to Pre , make sure you use your Pre for at least a month and happy with it before you start plunking down money for expensive accessories.Back to the topic : The case is way overpriced for what it is . It 's just 2 pieces of plastic ( plus a foam insert for the back cover when you 're not using a touchstone cover ) . Depending on where you buy , you 'll spend anywhere from $ 22-30+ . The plastic is quite thin , however this is a good thing b/c it also feels quite strong , so it will not add significant bulk to the phone . That 's one of the main differences compared to the $ 5 plastic cases on ebay . Plus it 's feather light . Fit is perfect . The thinness is the reason why touchstone works . If you 're familiar with touchstone , with the regular touchstone cover , the magnetic field makes the phone snap into place quite firmly onto the charger . This is putting a thin piece of plastic in between the touchstone cover and the touchstone base . So the phone does n't `` snap '' as firmly onto the charger and you have to more or less find the sweetspot ( you 'll know it when you feel it ) , but once on the charger , the phone stays on . Unfortunately , as others have mentioned , the magnetic bond is too weak to make it stay in place in a moving car.For those wondering , the case does not protrude into the gesture area or impede gesture or the slider mechanism whatsoever . How is this achieved ? By making the tabs that clip the case onto the phone as small and unobtrusive as possible . And THAT is the major flaw . There are 4 tabs at each corner of the top cover and bottom cover.I lovED the case . Then on day 3 , the bottom-right tab snapped off . No , I did not abuse the phone nor the case ( it 's a new phone , remember ? ) . This is just during regular use . You have to understand , these tabs are VERY VERY small and thin . To give you an idea , each tab has a width of a dental floss and only about 3mm long . It 's really just a matter of time before they give out and break off . So the back cover with 3 tabs now became a bit loose but still usable . B/c the Pre has legendary fit and finish ( ha ! ) , the loose back cover only added to the slightly loose slider mechanism and the overall , the phone felt cheap and old . Fast forward a month and today , the bottom-left tab broke off and now the back cover is pretty much useless . I 've had the case little over a month.Obviously , I 'm not the only one with this issue . You can find countless other reviews about the tabs breaking . Do n't think we are the few unlucky ones . Given time , this case will break . It will happen to you . You will not be the exception.So until Seidio addresses the major design flaw , you may be better off investing in a different case . If touchstone is important to you as it is to me , then you may want to consider getting one of those Zaggs clear films on the front - the film advertised as being used `` to protect helicopter blades '' that wrap around the corners and edges of the phone , not just the flat top surface . The back cover wo n't need protection b/c the touchstone cover has a rubbery , scratchproof finish and is replaceable.I 've read one reviewer saying Seidio replaced the case for free so I will be contacting Seidio soon to see if I can get a free replacement as well . But even if they did that , do I want to keep repeating a pattern of having to ship the broken case and get the new one ? Update 5/17/2010 : I actually contacted the seller ( authorized dealer ) about the case and they replaced it promptly for free . I just had to ship it to them , which cost me just two stamps and an envelope . This time , I got to enjoy it for about a month , then unfortunately , one of the tabs broke . I 'm done with this case . I 'll look into getting a clear film for the top while using the touchstone back.With everything said , I can not recommend this case . Save your money and look for alternatives.Update 7/20/2010 : AGF now makes a case that 's touchstone compatible . Google `` agf grt pre case '' . That said , I have been enjoying not having a case on my pre which also means I do n't have to put up with the bulk and the headache of it breaking . In the beginning I thought I needed a case instinctively to protect my new investment . But with anything , with enough use , the amount of care and attachment dwindles over time . I just have a screen protector film in the front and a touchstone back . I bought the screen protector film off of e bay ( 5 for $ 3 shipped ) and while it 's not Zaggs and does not cover the entire front surface ( does not go to the curved corner areas ) , it 's good enough for me . Zaggs is overpriced anyway .	-1
The first two Seidio Cases I owned were great , one was for a HTC Mogul and the other for a blackberry Curve . They served me well . I bought the case for my new Pre assuming that I would get the same high quality case I have received before . What a disappointment . The part of the case that covers the front of the phone broke the day I got it . The rear broke off about 2 weeks later .	-1
The tabs break WAY TOO EASY ! i broke 2 within 2-3 weeks of use ! i did like the little bulk added compared to other cases but i ended up dropping my phone 2-3x if not more due o the stupid tabs breaking until i just felt safer taking the case off . i would pick up my phone & the case would pop off so i would be holding the case & the phone on the ground . also if you do drop this with the case on the case will pop off ! @ least the Body glove case did n't pop off when dropped ( the whole reason i buy a case ) i drop my phone a lot ! Update 12/18/09Got replacement , that went ok but within 2 weeks ( possibly less ) 1 tab had broken & it was just down hill from there , 2 days latter another had broken & a 3rd on its way out . i took it off . less stress & less likely to drop it without the case . ( i woudl find my self holding a case in my hand with phone on floor due to case breaking ) try the Body glove one if you do n't care about the TS charger ! little more sturdy , can handle a drop or 5 .	-1
The speck case broke very easily . The rubber that connects to the hard plastic separated on every case that I owned . Also , there is a thin piece of plastic that is at the bottom of the case that breaks in half after some use . I would not recommend this product	-1
Wow , I wish I 'd have read the other reviews before actually purchasing this product.Design = horrible . How people can claim this `` protects '' something is beyond me . It certainly doesn'tThe `` skin '' ( that 's all it is ) is n't a 'shell ' , it 's a piece of plastic that can very easily be broken and covers only the back of the phone.While I did n't have an issue with 3rd party connectors ( ie : radio additions ) , I can see how this could be a problemWhile I did n't have a huge problem with the vibrate switch , again , I can see this being a problem in the future . My hands are huge , and this is going to be a nightmare eventually.The worst part ? NO protection is offered for the face at all . Most protectors at least wrap around the front , offering a minimal sort of 'padding ' . This thing ? Nope , it sits right around the back , not even touching the front part of the phone . This is BAD , because the front part of the phone is the one that 's the most fragile ! !	-1
We bought this sim card to put in my mother 's in law snaphone which we are sending to Michigan , we needed a passcode to establish an account on line , to refill the sim card , well that silly thing , it seemed like rocket science for these people , it was impossible .My husband spent an hour on th e phone , explaining to this robot , the whole situation , but Mr . Robot kept repeating his lines , no matter , what you said , he kept repeating the same thing , which had nothing to do with what we were asking for . So the customer service , is zero , now if what you need , just happens to be what these Robots repeat , then you are in luck , if not.Throw the sim card to the trash.What else.I thought ATT was good service so back to old T Mobile .	-1
Good price .	-1
Hard to use because it keeps falling out of your ear . Not a very good product . Find something else , that 's my suggestion !	-1
Overall , this is not worth getting , even at the 8 bucks.Pros : The earbuds stay in and have a good sealGood sound for calls and audiobooks , acceptable for musicCons : Microphone is not very goodThe control on the microphone does nothing , not with media player , phone calls , or anythingIt is HUGE when you have the microphone portion attached . Essentially the earbuds are one piece , then you put on another hunk of wiring with the microphone . The microphone is now nowhere near your face and you have to figure out how to clamp it so it 's remotely near your mouth.Would not buy again . I have doubts this is an LG product despite the label on it .	-1
To be completely fair , this product is exactly as described online . I got this item in a timely fashion and the product was just as I expected . It fits the phone and protects it from damage , just as anticipated , but the actual design of the gel cover is n't the greatest for using the phone . The sides wrap slightly around the front and makes using the keyboard a challenge , especially when trying to use the bottom corner keys like enter or shift ( Look at the picture carefully , you 'll see it 's cut out to get as close as possible to the keys , I did n't notice that when before I purchased , but the picture is accurate ) . The cut outs are right where they need to be for the side buttons and charger/headphone jacks though , and this does what it 's supposed to do as far as protecting the device . However , I use the keyboard much too often to continue with this cover . I 'm buying a replacement after 2 days of use of this cover . I 'm going to try the one that Blackberry makes , the pictures look like the sides do n't wrap around nearly as far - this one is just too thick and bulky.Kudos to the shipper , though - well packaged and arrived timely . It 's a good value and will protect your phone - but not for those who use the keyboard excessively .	-1
Feels and looks cheap , does n't protect the phone all that well . If you want a great case for any phone , check out Otterbox or Spigen cases . Much better .	-1
It was so loose on my phone that it fell off and was lost forever !	-1
It 's a bad and used battery even though it was listed as new one . It has crack on one corner . Charged it for whole day , put in the phone still have no juice . Waste my $ 5 ... ... ... ... .	-1
Battery would n't hold a charge and was faulty from the beginning . I was very disappointed and would not recommend his to anyone . Total waste of money !	-1
I tried two Tours and could n't take it anymore . I got an 8830 and it actually works . Here 's my analogy ... would you rather have a Mercedes ( Bberry Tour ) that 's in the shop , or a Toyota ( 8830 ) that you can drive ? Here is my list of complaints and comments on the Tour:1 ) The trackball did n't work correctly on the first one . On both Tours , I realized I would accidentally hit the trackball when my left thumb would go to the right side of the keyboard . ( For me typing the word `` you '' was the problem . ) The `` bump '' would make the cursor jump in my typing and mess up the sentence . On my 8830 the trackball is farther away and I do n't have the cursor jumping issue . If your thumbs stay on their side of the keyboard , it 's likely not a problem for you.2 ) The sound is horrible . Remember the old TV shows where people disguised their voices talking through a handkerchief ? RIM brought that technology to the Tour ! Everyone complained they could n't hear me ... like I was muffled . ( I did a test and heard it too . ) And that was on the HANDSET ! The speakerphone was worse because I was quiet and muffled . Bluetooth was unusuable . Really I 'd say the Tour is a great device , if you do n't need to use it as a phone ! 3 ) Battery life is horrible . After about 2 hours of talk time and maybe 5 of standby it was dead . I used to talk 8 hours on my previous bberry and it could go days on standby . What happened ? 4 ) GPS worked great on my first one but could n't lock on my location in under 10 minutes on my second one . It made me realize it did n't work on the second one correctly . Unfortuately Verizon disables the GPS on the 8830 so I did n't win on that point . I did love the GPS with Google Maps on the Tour.5 ) The media player was fine . It crashed watching certain MP4 movies but I only watched a few so I do n't know the cause.6 ) Camera and video camcording were great actually ... at least cell phone great.My advice is to get the Tour , make sure you do n't have a trackball problem , and make sure you give your phone to someone else and have them call you so you know the pain that others will feel when talking to you . For me , it was unbearable to have people say `` what ? '' 5 times per conversation . But to each his own ...	-1
It didnt ' work I have two Blackberry phones that would not sync with either with of our Blackberry phones. -- -- -- - We ended up getting a visor mount Motorolla which works great .	-1
Got this as a gift to my friend - apparrently the voice quality is not clear - this after spending 120 bucks ! Not so good with iPhone 3G - seems ok with other phones though ... but not wat we expected out of a BOSE product ...	-1
Horrible customer service - when contacted directly because I was dissatisfied with the product , he ( she ) resorted to personal , verbal assaults instead of dealing with the issues - wow - unbelievable . Do n't waste your time here - they charge a 50 % restocking fee for returns ! Review update : the seller is ALTEC . I would like to stress that my comments are directed towards this seller , not the product itself - the headphones themselves were fine , no complaints there .	-1
Well my husband does n't like this clip , I think its because he cant get it out of the case quickly . I think the case is fine ...	-1
I got this belt clip with my OtterBox Defender case for my iPhone 3GS . The belt clip DOES NOT HOLD THE PHONE SECURELY , so the belt clip is EXTREMELY prone to dropping the phone.In the six or eight months I 've had the Otter case / belt clip , I 've dropped my phone due to my own clumsiness ONCE , but the phone has hit the deck because this lousy belt clip dropped it maybe 99 times , including once in the toilet ! Because the Defender CASE is so amazingly effective , my iPhone lives unscathed , with nary a scratch , but ( oh the irony ) the OtterBox BELT CLIP is by far the single greatest threat that my iPhone faces . The BELT CLIP warrants NO STARS , zero , zip , nada , nil.The design of this belt clip is simply a failure . First of all , unless everything is absolutely perfect , the Defender case does not `` snap in '' to this belt clip . If any part of ( sides or bottom ) the Otter Defender silicone cover is not perfectly fit onto the case and properly closed up , or if any small bit of your clothing fabric gets into the mix , the phone will not `` lock '' as it goes in to the belt clip . Since THERE IS NO `` FEEDBACK '' as to whether it 's `` locked in '' the only way you find out it 's not locked in is when the phone falls on the ground or floor ( or in the water ) . Even when it does snap in , it 's not a very strong hold , so any very significant jolt or bump or movement or any halfway decent excuse and this worthless belt clip will drop your $ 5-6-7-800 worth of iPhone careening onto the concrete . Finally , the clamp that actually clips the holder onto your pants has a `` locked open '' setting . I have no idea what positive purpose of this design was intended for , but in practice , it tends to lock open when you do NOT want it open as you are bending and moving and so forth , so again , the whole thing is likely to drop off your waist and ( again ) hit the ground.I strongly recommend the Otter Defender case , but think people should know that the belt clip that comes with it works to the exact opposite direction of protection . I 've had it with this belt clip , it 's junk . I 'm throwing it away and am going to look for one that actually that holds the phone .	-1
I have had three clips break and now buy only the case ; no more blet clips for me.I do not abuse the clips unless you call normal wear as a teacher as abuse .	-1
A waste of money . I followed the instructions yet constantly have air bubbles . I 've repeated the process without success . Do not recommend .	-1
I have this exact charger that came with an earpiece , BUT the one I received from amazon does not match the one that came with the samsung earpiece . The color is grayish ... the cable material is different ... the cable length is different ... micro usb plug is different ... everything is slightly off ... so ... it is a very close copy but not a genuine samsung product ... I am not going to risk using it on my phone and damage my phone : ( at least it was less than $ 5 ...	-1
I was so excited at first because it looks good and came at cheaper price , but later i was disappointed because it is not charging my phone properly even though i kept my phone charging for couple of hours its barely filling 10-20 % of its battery only .	-1
After using this product I found that the speaker volume was n't loud enough for freeway use ( I could n't hear people talking to me ) and people had a hard time hearing me talk . I am sending the product back for a refund .	-1
The speaker is very loud when speaking to someone and the voice quality is clear . However the big flaw with this unit is that the ringer on it is so quiet that you would have to hold it right next to your ear to hear it . My reason for purchasing this is that when the radio is on and my phone rings it is very hard to hear it . I thought this would fix that problem by ringing loudly right above my head . Wow , was I wrong .	-1
I ordered this charger for my Palm Pre . It lasted 5 months and then the cable started to tear at the end , where the connection is that goes into the cell phone . After a bit , wires were sticking out and it failed to charge my phone . Piece of junk - I would n't buy this again ! Buy name brand stuff . The one I got with my phone lasted longer than this rip off one did !	-1
Flimsy , slides back and forth when you go around turns . The clips do n't work on all AC vents . It is also bulky and gets in the way of either dashboard controls or turn signals . It might look good on paper but in every day use its in the way and annoying . I returned it .	-1
It is a good idea behind this device but it doesnt charge my phone . It only holds the battery at the charge you plugged it in at . Example 50 % when i start the trip and 50 % after an hour driving ( not using the phone either ) . I expected more from a device with the belkin name . To me this was a waste of money but you get what you pay for i guess .	-1
I would like to hand it to the advertising people . They make it sound like its a wireless charging device but in reality it is only if you buy their special case for a select few devices ... which buy the way is sold separately . In the situations where they do n't offer the special case a wireless to power cord adapter is available for purchase which negates the whole wireless idea , again sold separately . There are many other detail reviews that are all saying the same thing which is it is n't as sleek as it sounds and there are many hidden costs . You must add an adapter to your phone ( which will make it bigger ) in order to charge it.What I would like to mention is an alternative . Check out the following link to Gomadic 's Universal Charging Station , this charging station is the only true charging station that comes with the charger and a few free tips to charge many devices . I see they sell tips separately for over 3,000+ devices , this charging station is truly upgradable and universal with no hidden gotchas.Gomadic Universal Charging Station for the Apple iPhone 3GS and many other mobile devices - uses Gomadic TipExchange Technology - 4 tips included	-1
I used to travel with a three outlet extension cord , and still had to plug devices in the bathroom . I bought this to reduce the number of outlets I needed . Note that it does not recharge an iPad 2 , and the `` door '' for the HTC EVO 4G is a piece of junk ( see separate review . ) However , I have been very happy with my purchase overall . I use the power cube , the Dual 1850 battery pack ( reviewed separately ) and iPod dock . I also use the USB port for other devices . No more climbing under desks to plug and unplug cords . If you buy this , be sure to read the reviews on the accessories before buying them . *****UPDATE*****After taking this on seven trips in three months , I stopped using it . I thought I should update my review . I changed the rating from four stars to two . Basically , it 's a good idea . However , in practice , it needs work . My main purposes of buying it was to be able to lay my HTC EVO 4G and iPod Touch 4G on the mat and have them fully charge by morning . I would use the Power Cube for my bluetooth headset and the spare USB port for my iPad2 , usingXMultiple iPad USB Charging Adapter . I also had a Dual 1850.There is no door for the iPod Touch 4g , so I had to use the Dock . The Dual 1850 does not have the capability to charge against the EVO 4G door , so you have to remove the plug from the door . It is removing and adding that plug that makes the door break ( see those reviews . ) The bottom line is that you end up carrying the power mat , dock , Dual 1850 and Power Cube just two charge four devices . Not only that , but with four devices sharing one outlet they were not fully charging.I do n't even use this at home anymore .	-1
As an engineer , it seems obvious that this product could not function as simply as marketed . The marketing is completely misleading.Standard devices like we all carry do not have an inductive charger built in , so there is no way for the Powermat to induce a charging current in the device that would be delivered to the battery without some sort of wired connection.I am surprised , sympathetic but still surprised , that so many people would believe the magic works as simply as marketed - `` just toss your iPhone on the pad and it charges ! '' I guess passengers on the maglev trains in Europe never have to charge their devices.It gives some perspective on the level of understanding people have about the electronic world we live in .	-1
Of the four charging doors I bought none of them work as directed . I have yet to be able to charge a phone .	-1
This review has been changed due to the change in the product description.This was originally advertised as a wireless charging product with wired charging capability . The controversy over the wireless aspect has led to a device title name that is now impossible to knock as deceptive . It is a Powermat.If you are the type of person who will go out of your way to cut cable clutter at all costs , including the loss of simultaneous usability while charging , than perhaps this may work for your needs.Cable/Clutter Phobic : This personality aspect does exist . Although cables still provide the fastest delivery of data , charge and functionality above all wireless alternatives to date there are people who will go out of their way to avoid having a visible cable.Wireless option , yes . Easier than a USB plug , no . Cutting clutter , if you do n't consider the mat and the wireless charging case clutter . Personally , picking up a cable already sitting on my night stand , desk , or console is as easy as it gets.As a multifunctional charging base , make sure that you investigate fully what comes in the box and the additional potential purchase requirements for devices not supported with or without optional accessories .	-1
I got this Powermat because it looked cutting edge and I thought it would be worth it to spend $ 100 to simplify re-charging small electronic devices . It did not turn out to be such a great time saver and I am returning it.Please note that it does not re-charge ALL small electronic devices . You need to have specific models and thankfully most of my gadgets complied . You also need to place each item to be re-charged into a Powermat receiver case ( additional purchases will be required ) and then place it on the Powermat itself . Or you could use the universal case with included tips but this is almost like using the device 's original charger . Your device is charged through the magnetic connection between the Powermat and the Powermat case holding or connected to your device . Remember to remove the receiver case after charging as it is not recommended for daily use . It seems an extra step and the opposite of simplification but it charged fast . It lets you know when you have made a successful connection . The process of fitting your electronic device ( iPod cases cost $ 40 ) into the charging case for the Powermat can be tricky at first . The included directions were not very helpful.Basically , this Powermat is an ultra cool looking devise that is the same thing as a decorative charger station ( Digipower SAM-G100-CH Executive Edition Charging Valet - Cherrywood ) but with more steps , compatibility issues and slight hassles with removing Powermat charger cases . I can not think the energy savings are substantial but hopefully it is the start of greener technology.I would not recommend this device over the usual charging cords unless you have money to burn and want the latest gadget .	-1
It does n't remotely do anything it says -- the picture is misleading , the title is misleading , the concept is misleading . If you purchase additional receivers and attach them to your phone , then they will charge . Basically this is a sorta-cool looking but way-too-big multi functioning charger that is about as wireless as a showerhead . You can read the all the packaging and still not figure it out -- until you open it up , of course .	-1
Not sure how long this will last . It feels flimsy . I also think this is designed to be put in place and never moved again . The sticky base part may not stand up to a lot of moving . Once the rubber part gets a lot of dirt and lint on it , it will not stick as well .	-1
I found it hard to see the iPhone in navigation mode and hard to remove the phone to answer it . I 'm no longer using the mount . My car has blue tooth so the latter is less of an issue . The phone wo n't go into the mount with a bumper on it .	-1
The SmartPad did not work on my Saab dashboard at all . It held for about 30 seconds total . I 'm very disappointed , but I 'm hoping the suction will stay on my windshield .	-1
Not the item that 's pictured here ! Totally different item ! Returned it as soon as I opened the packaging ! Amazon should not host third party items that are not advertised correctly !	-1
The product is old stock . The sticky tab will not clean off the protective covering w/out scratching it . Disappointed . Not a Deal At All	-1
These are the worst screen protectors I have ever purchased . I am always applying new ones every three months and I have no problems with bubbles and all that and if there is one or two I can get them out , but these were terrible . I went through all three of them trying to just get one on without thousands of bubbles underneath and they were thicker than usual protectors . I will not buy this again . I went to wal-mart and bought them . Paid more money , but no bubbles . This item appears as the seller described but did not work as supposed to . Thanks but no thanks ! : (	-1
I have not gotten this part either at my house so i went to the p.o . and the post office said it hasnt gone past forwarding please fix it ! its been a LOOOOONG time . This should have already been here also	-1
I guess it works how its suppose too , for what you 're spending you can get better spending a couple of more $	-1
You need to be very talented to get these on . They are very thin and bubble very easily . Unless you are a surgen , you will tear the first one ... ..That 's why they come in a 3 pack .	-1
Took me a couple tries to get it on correctly ! So , I wasted a few of them ! And I can never get all the bubbles out ! Wish they were easier !	-1
I was waiting for Mophie to release its iPhone 5 case and got sick of it ( 5 months ? Seriously ? ) I read about the SurfacePad online , ordered it , and I love it ! It looks great , fits the phone perfectly , and really allows the design of the i5 to speak for itself . I could not be more pleased ! Edit 6/22/2013 : I had to take this thing off of my phone , as the `` seam '' in the leather ( which was actually just glued ) started to split and come away from the cardboard ( ! ) inside . TwelveSouth supposedly has a warranty , so I contacted them for a replacement . They claimed to have no record of my email address . When I verified which email I had used with them by sending a copy of the invoice , I never heard from them again . TwelveSouth is not a company you want to do business with- they do not make quality products and they do not stand behind them . Avoid .	-1
This is the WORST case ever . Nice in design but whomever manufactured it , used the lowest quality materials . after less than a months use it is falling apart . It looks like it has been in service 5 years . Spend your money elsewhere . So now I find out that without the original box I can not return it for a refund , now I have to deal with the vendor and at best , will get a replacement . So , I 'm stuck	-1
The leather construction and the design of this case are certainly novel , however it has a major design flaw.The iPhone 5 has a noise canceling microphone on the back near the camera lens . When you fold the cover of the SurfacePad back to talk on the phone and hold the phone to your ear the cover blocks the microphone . The result is callers will have trouble hearing you and you will sound all garbled up and choppy . At first I thought this was just caused by my location . But after multiple calls in various locations no one could hear me well . After removing my phone from the SurfacePad calls in the same locations had no problems and callers could hear me loud and clear . My conclusion is that this not just a problem of the SurfacePad , but any case with a cover that folds over when you talk is going to cause you this problem.If you only use this case for using your device for things other than talking on it or you use a wired or Bluetooth Headset you will be ok with this case , but this kinda defeats the purpose of a phone ( for talking on it ) .It is also kinda awkward feeling and looks pretty strange when you are holding it up to your ear with the front cover folded back.I ended up buying 2 ( 1 red - 1 white ) Hex Solo Wallet for iPhone 5 which is a very cool case that holds my ID and a credit card and does not have a cover to block the microphone . It works marvelous.So if you want to use your phone like a phone avoid the SurfacePad !	-1
the cover is all floppy since it doesnt bend at the side of the phone as it can stand up as a stand . plus you get one piece of grit on it and it will scratch your screen .	-1
This cover only protects the back . The face of the phone is completely exposed . What 's the use ?	-1
This team will not buy it for my nephew , is no international version , is AT & T , normal rest . I have not used but my nephew is doing very well with it . Also I think the team is not completely new . By entering the battery cover will damage one of the fasteners , and with the backing to buy him and he realizes that . It has a small manufacturing defect where you enter the SIM , has a protruding plastic to be lifted in order to enter it .	-1
If u r looking for a brand new , Do n't go for this . I ordered and received in time . But its not a brand new . Its very refurb . Seller did n't mention here whether its brand new or refurb . Tats not fair.. 2 stars for the product and for the sellers , i can say buyers beware..	-1
Given my experience with TENQA products ( I recently gave a pair of their bluetooth headphones one star ) I was n't expecting very much of this speaker set , and I was right . While they 're definitely better than the abysmal headphones , I really think it 's worth spending a bit more to buy something that utilizes Bluetooth 2.0 EDR technology for better sound quality.Setup was actually impressively easy . You simply turn on the unit , my computer had no trouble finding it , pairing with it and then finding drivers for it . Once I switched my default sound device to the bluetooth speakers , they immediately began to output sound . I was tipped off to the poor sound quality when the unit identified itself as a bluetooth headset in Windows . Indeed , the sound quality is on par with an amplified Motorola headset , complete with background hiss and disturbance . I 'm no audiophile , and use a pair of JBL Radial 2.1 speakers in my normal setup , but these will sound awful to even the untrained ear . They might be doable as a kitchen set to which you can beam some Internet radio or something . But if you 're looking for anything beyond the most casual use , I 'd invest a bit more for something better . More perplexing is the fact that these ca n't operate by battery , meaning you 'll always be tethered to the wall by them . Given that , you 're better off buying a normal 2.0 or 2.1 speaker set and using an audio cable to play your music .	-1
I mean , in 2009 you expect even cheap bluetooth headphones to be OK . These are just awful.My unit was almost certainly defective as it seems some wires were crossed and callers heard THEMSELVES instead of me.But even had callers been able to hear me ( a luxury , I know ) the shoddy build quality and really awful design ( they 're HUGE ) would warrant a one-star review.While the sound quality for calls is passable , the unit does n't appear to utilize EDR which means AWFUL MP3 sound quality.Anyway , as other users commented , keep looking , you can get much better headsets for the same price .	-1
Bluetooth Stereo Headphones are fairly common now due to the proliferation of stereo cell phones and music players that allow bluetooth headphones.I have tried several but so far , the best set I have tried in terms of sound and comfort is thePlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones so that is the standard I used to evaluate this headset.First , setup for the headset is very easy . The earpieces are large ( and somewhat heavy ) but that allows for a nice clear user interface . Pairing is a breeze and follows a standard procedure that most users are familiar with at this point.In terms of fit , as I mentioned , the ear pieces are fairly heavy and they are designed to fit `` over the ear and behind the neck '' . However , I found that the ear pieces were too heavy and were continually sliding -- the back of the neck design was rigid and not as `` customizable '' as my Plantronics -- which features a flexible cable in the back and an in-ear design to stay in place better . The picture shows a women wearing these while running on a treadmill -- I have a hard time believing these would stay in place while walking much less running.Sound quality was ok -- about what you would expect for a headset in this price range . If you are using these primarily for cell phone communications , then you 'll be just fine . However , if you are expecting audiophile quality , you will be disappointed . Bass is thin and there really is n't much `` nuance '' in terms of the sound . Sound quality reminds me of a transistor radio as opposed to decent headphones . But again , you get what you pay for.Battery life is decent but does n't last the full 18 hours that they are rated for . In addition , it only comes with a short USB cable designed to charge through your computer . In my opinion , this is a poor choice . As a bluetooth headset , by definition , these are designed to be used `` on the road '' . As a result , you are n't always going to have access to your computer to charge these up . You can get an AC adapter that will accept the USB connection . However , that is one more thing to buy and keep track of . In addition , if you want to charge these while driving , once again , you are out of luck unless you want to buy yet another adapter . Before long , you can have more invested in power adapters than you have invested in these headphones alone.As I said , the Plantronics have been my favorite headphones for `` on-the-go '' communications and listening . Despite the lower price point , the Tenqa 's still fall short in terms of sound quality , comfort , and flexibility .	-1
If you 're looking for an average , every day Bluetooth stereo headset , this might be okay for you , but it 's definitely not for you if you 're a music lover . The sound quality in the pair that I received is really pretty poor . Do n't even look for quality bass sound from these - it 's not there.I found that , with these positioned exactly where they should be over my ears , the sound coming from this headset , for some reason , seemed to be getting filtered in from far away . It was n't a matter of the volume - the sound quality from the TENQA pair that I got just seems really substandard . Any bass sound seems to strain these , causing an annoying crackling sound accompanying the music that 's playing.Having asked callers how I sound during our calls , I 've been told that the sound is `` hollow '' , as if I 'm `` in a chamber '' , and I found the sound to be the same on my end of the calls , as well.As far as the headset 's appearance goes , it looks like it 's average quality , and these are quite lightweight - you may consider that a good thing , but I like to know that the products that I 'm buying have a decent weight to them , and seem to be strongly made . I would n't say that either of those conditions are met by this headset.Overall , if I were to place a value on this headset for the quality that they appear to be , I would n't price them any higher than a ten note . These just do n't stand up to the other headsets that are out there in their current price range . If you 're willing to drop thirty for a Bluetooth stereo headset , keep looking - these just are n't worth it , in my opinion .	-1
The promise of stereo Bluetooth is great . Who would n't love to listen to their favorite music and shows without wires , with the ability to take make a phone call with the same unfettered freedom.Unfortunately , no one has been able to get it quite right . I 've used a variety of stereo Bluetooth headphones , including theMotorola MotoROKR S9-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headsetand theSony Ericsson HBH-IS800 Stereo Bluetooth Headset ( Black ) and none of them are perfect . The sound quality is n't great and the connections are wonky . Sometimes they work well , other times there are frequent drop outs - who knows why ? They tend to do better with a direct line of `` sight , '' Motorola , for example , places the Bluetooth receiver in the back of their headphones and caution you not to put your phone in your front pocket or on your front hip - well , where else would you put it ? Who carries their phone behind them ? That being said , the Tenqas are in some ways pretty good for their low price . The sound is decent and I do n't find their connectivity any less robust than other models I 've used . If you want to wear them around the house , they 're probably a cost-effectively solution . They feel a little cheap , but they are cheap . So , at least you get what you pay for.But beware - if you 're thinking of wearing these out in the world , you better be comfortable looking like the ultimate dork . These eyesores put the ugh in ugly . The models I listed above are at least sleek looking and kind of sexy - the Tenqa 's look like something the Borg would wear . They 're big , bulky and call attention to themselves with a brightly flashing blue light that will make you look like a nut . What were they thinking ? Pros : Good priceWork as well as some higher-priced modelsConsBuild quality matches the low priceTragically ugly - children will point and laugh	-1
I used these headphones on my HTC Hero . The synching up was very smooth and I had no problem with that . The sound quality for the most part is decent . However , this is just an average bluetooth headphone and in fact , is probably worse than some of the other ones I 've had . The headphones itself sat very comfortably on my head.The biggest con of this is that when I am listening to music on my phone , it will skip at times and if I walk away even just downstairs , it would skip like a broken casette tape . The singer 's voice will suddenly speed up for no reason at all and then it would be all broken up.I also tried these for a phone call and was not impressed . While the headphone is sitting on my head , the other party can hear themselves echo , which did not make any sense as their voice was not being fed back to them . This was not even an issue when I had speakerphone on.I would probably give this 2 1/2 stars . It has a lot of potential but fails to actually work right when needed .	-1
Can not see this cover protecting the product from anything other than a drop onto a soft pillow . The cover snaps tightly over the product and is quite attractive . However , I would never attempt a & # 34 ; drop test & # 34 ; with this product.Ca n't really recommend if you are looking for a protective cover .	-1
I recently switched from an iPhone 4S - solid , square cut metal edges , a bit chunky - to an iPhone 5C , the thin , smooth plastic model . It 's actually more comfortable in the hand than the 4S or 5S , but it does need a little protection : maybe something a little less slippery . I first tried aCimo Shell Holster , but it was awful : the foam case was too soft , and it was hard to remove the phone from the holster . So I decided to go minimal , and got this simple clear plastic snap-on case from Belkin.It 's very simple , very basic , unobtrusive , not at all fancy . It 's almost exactly right , except for one thing . It 's *JUST* a bit too long . Just one or two millimeters . But the result is that the phone jiggles in the case . Just up and down , not side to side . Not a lot . Just enough to be set-your-teeth-on-edge annoying.Maybe it 's just me . Perhaps I 'm too fussy . But when I pull the phone ( in its case ) out of the leather holster on my belt , and press the power button on the top , I do n't want the phone to shift in the case . But it does . Every time.Sigh.Update : I 've been traveling in Hong Kong for the last week , using my iPhone extensively for mapping , Twitter , checking conference schedules , and so forth . The jiggling of the phone in the case has been driving me crazy . Originally I gave this two stars , but that was before I tried living with it . One star only - and that 's generous !	-1

There 's hardly much to say about this & # 34 ; case & # 34 ; . It snaps right on easily but I ca n't see how this could offer any protection for an iPhone . You might as well not even have a case . The only thing this would do is keep the back of the phone from getting a lot of scratches .	-1
I was completely underwhelmed by this case/cover . In fact , I 'm not even sure how they can include the word & # 34 ; case & # 34 ; in its description - it 's very light , flimsy , and feels cheaply-made . It *did* fit well on my iPhone 5c , so I 'll give it that . But otherwise , I put this on my phone and immediately removed it . It was n't very stylish , and did n't seem to provide much protection . I did n't see the point of keeping it !	-1
Went from opening package to the trash within 24 hours.. If you are looking for a throw away case for a weekend trip this will be the case for you .	-1
The item arrived a few days after ordering it . After installing , I discovered that the camera hole was not aligned correctly and thus ended up buying one from Fry 's at 3 times the price . Maybe they shipped the wrong item ( ? ) , other than that , the skin would have been great .	-1
The description states for iPhone , however when the package arrived in bold print on the front it says for iTouch . There are some small pictures of an iPhone on the side that indicates it fits an iPhone , but it doesnt actually state that anywhere . As other reviews state , the iPhone is exposed completely at the top . It is clearly too small to adequately protect your iPhone . Otherwise the quality and fit is perfect for me - a smaller frame female . I am sending it back as I need my phone completely protected , but I wish it worked since it is the only one I have ever had actually fit my arm .	-1
Although it is good quality and design it is reaaallllyyyyy not an average person size ... if you have frog-arms it will fit perfectly ... lol	-1
Looking at this purchase , I should n't have expected much . Under $ 7.00 shipped ? Stupid me to expect something high quality.1 ) Case is the BEST part . It 's hard plastic and rubberized . It has a belt-clip feature as well , which is nice . It will protect your phone from scratches . That being said , it 's Black rubberized WHITE PLASTIC , so the first time you drop it or scuff it , you have a white spot . Not the biggest deal.2 ) Screen cover falls off almost immediately . Really low quality . Even when it WAS on , it really made the screen look fuzzy , so when it fell off , I felt no remorse.3 ) The WORST part is the charger . There is NOTHING rapid about this charger . It does n't charge the phone . Then again , when you hold it , and realize just how light it is , you should n't expect great results . It weight about 1/10th as much as my I-Go for the car , and it charges about 1/10th as much as a charger should . If you plug in your phone with 1 bar of battery with NO other programs running , it will have 1 bar of battery an hour later when you unplug it . If you use ANY programs or make a call , your phone will LOSE battery even with this plugged in .	-1
The car charger did not fit my Curve 8530 and neither did the face cover . Buyer beware	-1
The charger stopped working and broke shortly after I purchased it . Very cheap ! I 've never used the case but it appears to be durable . And the screen protector was good .	-1
The LCD protector did not fit my phone from the start . This caused it to blister on the edges which in turn caused dust to buildup and eventually push the protector away from the LCD it was protecting . The Plastic case that comes with this devise is made of such poor materials that the clips that hold it together broke while putting it together . I basically paid the money to use these items for 1 day . Not worth the money , and it was in shipping longer then it worked on my phone .	-1
great for a younger age ! I bought it for my niece and she loves it . I have bought twi more of these	-1
I thought when it said faceplate that it also came with a back , but that 's all it was a back plate it just fits on the back , the moral of the story always read everything and look at all pictures and reviews .	-1
this item was broken when I received it , the edge was broken when I opened the soft pack that it came in .	-1
This worked good but the ear pieces were all much too large to fit in the ear of a smaller person . Easily set up and paired to iPhone . Like the voice confirmation that it is connected and to which phone , and the strength of battery . Clear sound both sending and receiving . Just wish Motorola would have been helpful with even being slightly interested in making the rubber ear pieces for other sizes of people/ears . Had to send it back as even Amazon could not get Motorola to develop smaller ear pieces .	-1
This could have been the best headset I ever owned . I had just bought a Motorola H375 , fed up with Plantronics and Jabra 's not being anywhere near as good as they should be ( not including BT250v ) .Worked great for two weeks . Talked to me - told me battery strength and if the phone was linked . Convenient power on off - slide allowed you to slide off when not using , slide on to pick up call . Volume buttons hard to use - too close together . Great reception - took a call in a busy factory across a large room ( phone on one side , me on other ) .Only problem was it was not as loud at the H375 . It needed an earpiece to direct into your ear . But the earpieces that had some direction into your ear ( and left over others ) would not stay on , even if you looped this loop on the piece around the unit . This would have been best ever - if I could have figured out a way to keep the earpieces from falling off eveyr time I grabbed the H790.After ten days , unit just went bad . People could n't hear me , I could n't hear them . If I turned H790 off and turned H375 on , in same place , H375 worked fine . Returne H790 . Back to thicker , less fancy , but louder and with usable buttons H375 . BTW , H375 highly recommended .	-1
This is not the best iPhone stand but I recommend a different stand but this is a nice quality stand if you are looking for one .	-1
Like a lot of families , my husband and I seem to have a million and one things that need charging ... which means one million and one cords all over the house , taking up all the outlets . The myGrid seems like such a great idea -- a grid that you just lay your device down on to charge it -- but as it relates to the iPhone , at least , it has several flaws.First off , the starter kit comes with a case for the iPhone , which makes it work with the grid . However , it 's not a particularly attractive or protective case ; if you 're a case person ( I am ) , this is probably NOT the one you 'd choose . In addition , the part of the case that makes it work with the grid plugs in to the docking port , which means : 1 ) If you drop your phone while it 's in this case , there 's a good chance you 'll damage the pins in the port , 2 ) You ca n't dock your phone in any sort of device with this case on it , and 3 ) You ca n't sync your phone with the case on it.Of course , if you 're using some OTHER case , you 'll have to remove it before using the myGrid case . What a pain ! I 'd rather just have the cables lying around , at this point.Second , the kit ONLY includes one grid and one case . If you want to charge two devices or more ( which is sort of the whole point of the myGrid ) , you 'll have to pony up over $ 30 for another sleeve or aDuracell myGrid Power Clip ... this is starting to get expensive ! Honestly , I used the myGrid a couple of times , but once the novelty wore off ( and I got tired of taking cases off and putting them back on ) , I quit using it . It 's just quicker and easier to leave a cord plugged in someplace handy , or to charge my phone in my combo speaker/charger . ( Which cost only a little more than the myGrid , and has the added bonus of letting me actually listen to music . ) Incidentally , for those who are curious , the case does seem to fit my iPhone 4 just fine . It 's not a perfect fit , but it does work , since the i4 is slightly smaller than the 3G/3GS , which the sleeve was technically made for .	-1
This seems like a really cool product at first , but really it 's just an interesting concept.It 's not cheap and neither are the adapters for different phones . You have to attach this big plastic thing to your phone with double sided tape to be able to use the charger . I do n't want a big plastic thing stuck on my phone . Maybe someday these charging pads will become popular and phone manufacturers will make phones with the charging contacts built in , but till that day I want nothing to do with these things .	-1
The only benefit that I can see to having one of these is that you have a limited number of electrical outlets . Or you need to have all your devices charged at one outlet in a area measuring 9 '' x8 '' ? As nice an idea as `` wireless charging '' may sound , it 's not , and to be honest probably as much hassle as plugging each device into an outlet with it 's own charger ( usually supplied when purchased ) The mat looks nice , it 's thin and stylish , only uses one electrical outlet of course , and would grace any counter-top or area where you keep your keys and phone to charge them.While I was wondering who it was for , I also asked myself who actually charges all the phones in the household at once anyway ? You need to attach the `` Power clip '' you know , like you would attach the power cord that you usually use to charge your phone . Hopefully one of the 3 included adapter tips will actually work with your model into your phones mini USB port.I have a 3 month old LG Shine , I guess they 're really obscure ? And ( you guessed it ) the adapter does n't work on my phone , it displays `` MP3 charge error '' when attached.The box boasts support for Nokia , Motorola and Blackberry and no doubt works OK with them , mine requires another `` tip '' - sold separately of course.The box also says charge up to 4 devices at once ! WOW ! - with one clip ? So I checked and sure enough you can buy additional clips , they 're only about $ 35 a piece ! So to sum up , for a little over $ 200 you can charge four devices on a shiny silver pad by wireless technology ? ? ? Or stick with your original chargers that cost mmmm , oh yeah they were free ! Gim me a break . If this is n't a waste of money I do n't know what is .	-1
At first I was very excited about the Duracel myGrid starter kit . My wife is impatient with tangled cables running everywhere , so I thought it would be great to set up a charging station on our counter with only one cable . But once I opened the package and set it up , I realized that this is n't a workable solution for my family.___________________What You Get : * A good sized platform to set up to four devices for charging . * A charger cable . * Three types of charger tips . * One adhesive clip ( Yes , just one ) ___________________The Problems : Starting with the obvious : This kit only comes with one of the adhesive clips that is required to charge your device . So this whole kit only gets you ONE charged phone . That 's a shame , since there are two other charging tips included in the package.Speaking of the package , the packaging was worse than most . The charging tips were nearly impossible to get out of the package without damaging them . I would n't have tried so hard if I 'd know I could only use one of them.Most importantly , this charging solution is designed so that you will leave the tip and the fairly bulky adhesive clip attached to your phone at all times . That means you 'll have a much bulkier phone IN YOUR POCKET , because it probably wo n't fit in any holster or case anymore . The tip and clip also interfere with any buttons that are near the charging port on your phone.You will also have trouble if you access the charging port on your phone for data transfer , which is likely , since two of the three included tips are mini-USB . That means you 'll have to remove the tip from beneath the clip before you can connect your data cable ( and then hope that you do n't lose the tip ) .I found this setup to be very impractical and to create more of a nuisance than the charging cables . If the entire purpose of the product is to reduce the number of cables , then the solution is worse than the problem . My wife is the one who hates the charger cables , but she told me to get rid of this charging station ASAP.Even if I could get over the nuisance of the bulk added to the phone , the price seems way too high to me just to get rid of a couple of cables . Remember that you 'll need to purchase additional tips & clips before you can charge more than just one phone .	-1
Before this product , I had never heard of a charging mat/grid , so this was my first experience with one . My first question in seeing this item was : why ? Why would someone need to charge their items all together in one place ? And who has three different cell phones to charge that are all different brands ? The concept itself is neat , but I just wonder how many people would really see a benefit from this type of item ? For example , I have an iPhone ( and stupid me , I did n't realize this item , out of the box , did n't have an iPhone clip ) so in my case , I 'd be spending $ 76 ( ! ! ! ) to get the charging grid and another $ 35 to get the iPhone sleeve ( which from what I can tell is n't out yet ) . So , I can spend $ 110 to charge my iPhone with the Duracell MyGrid , or , I can charge it for FREE with the cable that came included with my iPhone . & lt ; sarcasm > Tough choice there & lt ; /sarcasm > I just do n't see who this item is for . Families perhaps ? I ca n't imagine a person who owns only one phone would ever use this device . You 'd have to be a family of four who had all just lost their charging cables to find a benefit in using this device . There is simply no cost savings here ( cost increase , actually ) and you 'll likely incur even more cost if your phone is n't supported out of the box ( the myGrid supports some Blackberries , LGs and Nokias ) .So I took this thing to work to see if anyone there would use it . Remember , this mat only supports LG , Nokia and Blackberry out of the box . However , no one was willing to adhere anything their phone and/or their phone would n't fit the adapters I had ( we have some iPhones , a lot of BlackBerry Storms and WinMo devices ) . Simply put , no one had any interest in using this thing ! I finally got my boyfriend to use the item , though he was n't enthused about having something stuck to the back of his phone so we did n't adhere it permanently . When I finally unpacked this thing , I noticed only 1 clip was included . Nice . Guess how much another clip is ? $ 35 ! So if you are charging four phones on this thing , you 're looking at a total cost of $ 181 ! We finally put his device on the myGrid and yes , it charged . It charged well . The device itself is very sleek looking and lightweight . That 's about the only positive thing I can say about it . Setup and installation is super easy.Basically , this device just is n't convenient . It 's expensive and will likely require you to purchase other clips or sleeves . That 's one expensive way to charge a phone ! PROS : * Attractive design* Ease of use* Convenience , sort-ofCONS : * Cost ! OMG , the cost ! $ 76 is just wayyyy too much money for this thing . Even if FIVE cell phone brands were supported out of the box AND it came with FIVE clips , $ 76 would still be way too much for this item . * Out of the box , you only get one clip . Additional clips are $ 35* iPhones are supposed to be supported , but they are not for sale yet . And , again , another $ 35 if you want to charge your iPhone . * I 'm not sticking anything to my phone , period . There 's no way I 'm walking around with something adhered to the back of it , adding more bulk .	-1
The Duracell myGrid is a awesome idea that went very wrong somewhere between their R & D ; labs and their packaging and marketing departments . The idea of having a conductive mat to charge multiple phones is something that is cool and could be used by many households . Duracell 's implementation of this idea utterly fails for a couple reasons , though.First , what 's in the box in underwhelming . You get the mat , the AC plug , one swivel clip , and 3 adapters . The 3 adapters are 2 mini-USB adapters ( one right side up , the other upside down ) and 1 Nokia adapter . Clearly , the mGrid has been in development for years and is only being released now . This is evident because mini-USB plugs are typically found in phones 2008 and older , and the Nokia plug , while useful world-wide , does n't have as high a penetration rate here in the US . Or at least , as high a rate among the type of early adopters that would be interested in this product . There is no iPhone adapter ( until Spring 2010 ? ) , there are no Palm adapters , and unbelievably , there are no micro-USB adapters ( commonly found in 2009 and newer phones ) . So if you 're still rockin ' your RAZR from 2006 , maybe you 'll find what 's in the box to be useful . I did not purchase this product , it was given to me , and I actually had to bust out my old RAZR just to test it ... Second , the conductive clip part has an adhesive back that you are supposed to stick to the back of your phone , and then have one of the 3 included adapters jammed into the side or bottom of your phone . Yeah , adhesive , as in -- it 's gon na be on there forever . Adding all that bulk to your phone . No joke . On top of that , if you have a smartphone that you want to sync with your computer through your 2008 mini-USB port , um , well , you ca n't do that cuz you have the adapter jammed in the plug . Even if you slip out the adapter , the clip on the back is still going to block many of the USB connector cables out there . Finally , if you 're using your mini-USB phone from 2008 , you 're probably going to get a new one in 2010 ( when your 2yr contract expires ) , which means you somehow have to peel off the adhesive to place it on your new phone ( assuming you can buy a new adapter from Duracell 's website in the future that fits your new phone ) . I was able to position the clip and adapter in my RAZR without using the adhesive , but the magnet is surprisingly strong . Pulling the phone off the mat caused a lot of strain on the phone 's USB port . Repetitive usage like this could easily damage the port on the phone . In addition , without the adhesive , it took me way longer to insert the clip + adapter in the RAZR and carefully pull it off the mat when finished than it does to simply just plug/unplug the regular AC charger , thereby eliminating all advantages of using the mat.I will mention that the grid does indeed work and does charge up a RAZR in about the same time as the regular AC charger . But Duracell totally failed in the execution of the device . These people make batteries ! What we need are Duracell-made battery replacements with the small metal conductance nubs on the back . This way you just pop in the new battery and can lay the phone , without any extra bulk , directly on the grid . Palm does this with their Pre phone and the Touchstone accessory and it works incredibly well . Also , Duracell should offer replacement batteries/adapters for cameras , video game controllers , and other electronic devices . This would be a 5-star , highly versatile product if they did all this . But no , instead we get 2 mini-USB plugs , a Nokia plug , and one swivel clip . A craptastic failure pile in a box ! As a techie gadget lover , I want to really like this product . The actual grid itself is cool . Unfortunately , there is no other word to adequately describe the adapters + clip idea other than `` stupid . '' At the time of writing this , the Grid goes for $ 70-90 . If they dropped the price to $ 50 , included adapters for video game controllers and cameras , and offered conductive replacement batteries on their website like I mentioned above , this thing would be a gadget-person 's dream charging station . Until then , I 'm not sure how the people at Duracell pushed this out to market . Too bad ...	-1
Warning : This `` starter '' kit only includes 1 'Power Clip ' so I find the cover art and description fairly misleading as you can only get 1 phone on here for $ 80 and you need to spend almost $ 20 to get the other power clips . This is an extremely expensive outlay.Other design drawbacks : - Although the charging pad looks awesome , you need to have a big plastic sticker on attached to the back of your phone . It does n't look sleek.- Newer blackberries are not supported- The power sleeves for the Iphone are fairly bulky and not very sleek .	-1
The USB charger interface was very famous in 2007 and early 2008 . In 2009 , most phones including RIM phones such as the blackberry tour , blackberry javelin , blackberry storm and the blackberry 8520/8530 saw the transition to Micro-USB interface . Even the Palm Pre uses Micro-USB.What this basically means is that one needs a micro usb charging plug in order to make this device work.Unfortunately , this device does not `` as of yet '' ship with a micro-usb plug thereby rendering it a little useless for me.Of course , one can add on more plugs and go use the device but when almost all the phones/devices in my house use micro-usb , this seems a little aimless.Where one is spending a decent sum of money , one expects the product to ship with all the bells and whistles , instead of going hunting for smaller devices .	-1
This device represents an very intriguing idea -- a single device by the door for all the family members to be able to just flop your devices , and presto , they all get charged . But in execution , this does n't come close and I 'd recommend a pass on this product , especially the iPhone version.1 . Your iPhone has to be put into a special Duracell sleeve to work on the unit . But with the sleeve on you can not use the iPhone USB cable to SYNC your device or use in any other cradle type device . Taking off theDuracall case would get old very quick.2 . You have to give up whatever case you have today . Although the rubber case included is of decent construction , it is nothing to brag about.3 . In this package you get only ONE case/sleeve . You can buy others , but at $ 35/each.4 . Only two iPhones would fit on the MyGrid ( see the phone ) - NOT the four it says on the box ; plus the power supply is limited for multiple iPhone devices.5 . Unlike a charging cable and wall plug , the charging pad does take up space , even if you are not charging anything.The MyGrid is great idea , but it makes charger harder not easier . You 'd be better off buying two Apple charging docks .	-1
The Duracell Powergrid is trying desperately to capitalize on the new cordless charging device playground , but the service that this item provides is so out of date that it borders on being embarrassing . Basically , the device 's cordless charging capabilities are based on a sort of remote plug that you put into your wireless phone or mp3 player and then you lay it on the pad . The three chargers that come with the device are for devices that are so old that you would need to travel back in time at least three years to find a device that you could put these chargers in . So forget your iPod or your newer Blackberry or newer wireless device , period . You want to charge those on the Powergrid , guess what you have to do ? You have to buy the chargers.There is no way any part of this device will simplify your life or even make you happy in any way , so just skip it .	-1
This product is a case of creating a poor solution for a problem that does n't really exist . It was really easy to charge my phone by plugging it into the charger that came with it . But wait , instead you now want me to glue on some weird disc to the back of my phone , and add special tips just so that I can charge it ? Or I have to buy a special sleeve which adds bulk and cost to do the same ? No thanks .	-1
The Duracell myGrid for iPhone does exactly what it claims to do . That is not the problem . The main criticism I have about the myGrid is that it is unnecessary.The kit consists of a soft plastic case for the phone and an approximately 6 by 9 inch grid on which you lay the phone while in the special case . Four contact points on the back of the case transfer power from the grid to the case . The phone is `` docked '' inside the case , which is how the power gets into the phone . If you put something metal ( or even touch the grid ) it shorts and turns itself off . You can not dock the phone while it is in the case . The grid only charges the phone . To sync the phone , you have to take it out of the case . This makes the case almost useless.Charging is just as quick as with the iPhone wall charger . The case adds approximately 2mm of extra thickness to the back of the phone and an approximately 5mm nub to the bottom of the phone . This kept it from fitting in my belt holster.The case feels cheaply made . All the required holes are there except the dock . The camera hole did not line up perfectly . While the phone is in the case , it is hard to operate the volume , silencer , and off switches.If the loss of the dock were not enough , here is my main criticism . Why is this needed ? It is not very difficult to attach a cable to charge an iPhone . Plus the grid takes up space . Maybe if you wanted to charge multiple devices on the same grid , there would be a convenience factor , but not for just one device.The disadvantages are : a poor quality case , increased size of the phone , space for the grid , and an inability to sync ( or dock with anything ) while the phone is in the case.The advantages are : none .	-1
Ever been bitten by an elephant ? But you 've probably been bitten by a mosquito ... it 's the little things that get you ! And it is the little things that drop my rating on this iphone charger . The charger does charge the phone so it gets a couple stars for that . Nitpicks that prevent the charger from rising above two stars relative to competition : -Size : The charging unit is big and bulky ( no kitchen counter for this one ) .-Lighting : There is a light on the unit that is too bright . If kept in the bedroom at night the light is distracting and had to actually be covered up.-Talk While Charging : If your phone is dead you ca n't talk on the phone while it is charging from what I can tell.-Phone Cover : You have to use the phone cover , but people report that voice sounds muffled when talking on the phone with the cover on it.-Pricey : Expensive , there are other alternatives that perform better for lower price .	-1
First off , let me start off by saying that I totally understand the novelty of this product and others like it . Charging multiple devices is one of those things that is just not very elegant . However , the myGrid is not an acceptable answer to this problem.The price of this starter kit is high -- TOO high , especially considering you 're only getting one clip for one device . Then , you 're looking at spending another $ 30+ or so for each additional clip for each additional device that you want to charge . Talk about an expensive solution ! And all that just so you can place the device on the matt instead of plugging it in . And what happens when you switch cell phones or MP3 players in the future and your existing myGrid clip is n't compatible with your new device ? You 're out the cost of the original clip and now you have to purchase a new one ! I much prefer a less expensive option that gives you additional benefits : a charging station/valet . Not only do you get the benefit of hiding all those unsightly cords and making things look nice and tidy , but often you get additional storage compartments and drawers ... and at a price that ca n't be beat when you compare it to myGrid and other power mats . Take a look at some of the great options you have for charging stations : Mark Feldstein VL8C Charging Valet , CherryMark Feldstein VL8 Charging Valet , Satin Black6-Outlet Charging Valet for Handheld Electronic DevicesGadget Smarts WBP400 Classic 4 Wood Organizer & Charging Station w/Power Strip ( Black ) Lipper International 2112 Cherry Charging StationSome of them even come with the power strip that is hidden away . Or , just search Amazon for `` charging station '' or `` charging valet '' for more options . : )	-1
Short version : We tried to use this , we really did . But in the end my wife , who was the most excited about it , just took it off and went back to her cheap casecrown case.Long version : You have to remove the cover to charge your phone in the car.You have to remove the cover to be able to sync your iphone and I tend to take music and games on and off my iphone a lot.It does n't seem like it protects your phone very much , and I really did n't want to drop my phone on purpose to test it.It just seems like too many negatives for such a small positive.I would rather plug my phone into myAltec Lansing T612 Digital Speaker for iPod and iPhone ( Black ) when I get home . This takes the same amount of effort , charges my phone , and I can listen to a movie or some music at the same time . Its really not a related product , but I like charging that way so much more ...	-1
We got this charging station thinking it would save us from the octopus tangle of wires we have on our desk but alas we found it to be just as frustrating . The idea behind this station is simple - one plug , multiple phones can be charged but what Duracell does not mention is that that for each phone you want to charge you must have a special clip . This clip is supposed to be permanently attached to your phone , thus making it difficult to keep in a protective cover or case.The kit is easy to use but only comes with one of these clips ( this kit comes with 3 - but one is for the blackberry , one is set for Motorola and the last is for use with a Nokia ) . If you want to charge a second phone you will need additional clips , which you can purchase separately , making this set not very cost effective.While this is a great idea on paper it is certainly not well executed . Until someone creates a power charging grid that one can simply place their phone down on with no attachments I will stick with my charging cord .	-1
I was excited to receive this item ( via Vine Program ) . I have always wanted to own something like to this to eliminate the excess cords , clutter ETC . It is fairly compact and it 's `` refreshing '' not to see all the various cords all over my kitchen counter . It is also pretty stylish looking which is important if it is going to sit out on my kichten counter for all to see . Unfortunately , my enthusiasm waned greatly when I realized that I would have to purchase additional tips for my Ipod and my husband 's Iphone . Out-of-the-box , it comes with 3 tips that will work for BLACKBERRY Pearl 8100 Series , Curve 8300 Series , 8800 Series , and Bold Series . It also works with MOTOROLA RAZR , RAZR V3 series , MOTOQ Series , as well as W385 + W370 . Finally , there is a tip for NOKIA E71 Series , 2610 , 6085 , 6555 , 6061 . With the popularity of the Apple Iphone and Ipod , it is almost unfathomable that it does not include a tip for either/both of those gadgets . The retail price is over $ 75 which seems absurd give that I can only charge my Blackberry phone without purchasing additional tips . To summarize , it 's a great concept ( I love how it turns off automatically if anyone touches it ) but it is way too overpriced in my opinion , especially without the inclusion of some other tips .	-1
I remember reading awhile back about energy usage in the near future -- specifically about charging our devices without the need for wires . Envision being able to install ceiling lights without having to dig out the ceiling . One of the features mentioned in the article was the ability to charge your ipod , cell phones , gps device , etc . all by leaving them on a single charging pad . So , I was really excited to see the Duracell mygrid on the Vine program.But my excitement quickly faded when faced with the reality of a technology in its infancy . The charging pad seemed as unwieldly as a mass of chargers anyways . At least , if I plug in a power bar to the outlet , I could charge five different devices ( yes , with wires everywhere ) in a small corner jumbled together . The myGrid actually demands horizonal space ! I 'm sorry , but in my house , flat surfaces are in high demand whether it 's in the kitchen , dining room , or office . I knew that this grid would take up valuable space from other objects or that the grid itself would end up being covered by paper or something or other . Moreover , despite violating the injunction against taking up flat surface space in my home , it does so only so that it can charge 1 or 2 phones at a time ( the grid is small ) ! At least when I 'm using an adapter , I can unplug it and throw it in a drawer when the phone is not charging , i.e . not taking up ANY space.My other beef was with the need to cover my beautiful phone with this ugly rubber case that has specialized contact points that connect with the grid in order to be charged . first , the rubber case did not look that sturdy and I did n't want to be rid of my ifrogz case that has withstood the test of a 3 year old throwing it down the stairs . Moreover , I found it unduly burdensome to have to buy a separate rubber case for every single device that I 'd like to charge on the myGrid . Finally , the case was pretty ugly.I think that this technology is going to rock in a decade or so . I think that early adopters are probably just shelling out for a nuisance though .	-1
With a busy family and several phones , I thought this would be a nice central charging spot for all of us . I was surprised when I opened the box that this grid was so thin , which was nice , but otherwise it 's not a very attractive device , so I did n't want to put it in plain view . But that is a minor point , compared to the actual use of the grid . The tips they provide are for specific types of phones , although you can purchase some others , but since you still have to have them hooked up to charge , I 'm at a loss as to what advantage this pad provides . I imagine that it might be handy for a small business that wants to keep their phones in a central location to charge . I ca n't see taking this setup with you when you travel , so you still would need your regular chargers handy for those occasions . The bottom line is that no one here wanted to add a tip or adhesive attached clip to their phone anyway , so we will not be using this device , since it 's just easier using a regular charger .	-1
This is one of the poorest designed products that I have seen . The price is way out of range . It only comes with one bulky `` thumb charger clip '' ( and three adapters that may or may not fit your phone ) that attaches on your cell phone with tape ( provided ) . The adapters are expensive , around $ 30 . The adapters only fit a few phones and models . If I wanted to buy 4 adapters it would cost me about $ 120 . So the charging grid cost about $ 70 and 4 adapters about $ 130 , total price to charge 4 phones around $ 200.I had a Motorola phone that it did work with , but I had to tape the `` thumb clip '' to it and found that it was too bulky to carry in my pocket . I have since switched to a Samsung phone and they are no adapters that fit the Samsung.I do NOT use this product and now it is cluttering up my closet waiting to be discarded . This product is so poorly designed and priced too high that only Duracell would choose it market it . This product is too much trouble to deal with ... and I rarely write a one star review . Do not buy this product . Look for other grids or wait for improvement on design and price to go down.I bet Amazon and other retailers are flooded with returns . Shame on Duracell for trying to push this good idea , but poorly designed product !	-1
This thingy mijiggy is OK . It does have a pretty good case that has the integrated charger . This is really the way to look at it . If you sync your iPhone often or do n't mind plugging it in to charge - then this is not for you . If you want a pretty good case and a `` drop it on the counter '' charging station - then this is your deal . Other wise - just keep your cash and plug it in when you get home .	-1
I was given the opportunity to review this item and I looked forward to it.I thought that anything that reduces the clutter of a million power cords ca n't be bad . And certainly , this is not a bad product at all . It just lacks good execution.Pros:1 . Design : nice looking design to be sure . Fairly compact ( about 7 inches across by 4 5 inches wide ) , plus a power cord and a small blue power light . This item turns off the power when you place your hand on it , so no worries bout getting a zap of juice at all.2 . Size : You can place four items on the grid , which makes it ideal for a family to power their devices if you have the right tips ( more on that under cons ) , so it is a space saver.3 . Coolness : this item ranks pretty high on the coolness factor . It is a great idea always to get rid of a million different cords , but ... .Neutral:1 . Cost : this item costs a significant amount of money . I guess my question is why I would fork over a chunk of money to reduce clutter ... money versus clutter ... I think money may win out for me on this one . Plus , if I upgrade my phone , I have to go and buy another tip.2 . Travel : this item is large enough the travel is not necessarily made convenient by having this item . This is one downside of this item.Cons:1 . Tips : You have to have the right tip to insert into your phone , headset , etc . to attach it to the magnet provided so you can get juice to your device from the grid . On the model I was provided , I was given tips for Blackberry devices and Nokia , but not the Blackberry mini USB . Thus , I could n't really use the item without purchasing the correct tips for each device including one for the Blackberry Curve and and IPhone . This is another significant cost , and again the question is whether I want to spend money to save some clutter . I am not really sure many people will want to incur a significant cost to save some clutter for different cords when this is intended for home . Plus , you will be provided with the cords for home use already when you purchase the product.Overall this is a GREAT idea . it is just that asking someone to spend a good deal of money ( it is more expensive than some of the phones your powering ) is not a good design strategy . Great idea , poor execution . It is just okay .	-1
The Duracell myGrid charging device is a product you want to like . Imagine the possibilities , you come home and toss your phone , iPod or other device on the pad and walk away . No wires to plug and unplug , no more having several chargers plugged in the wall outlet . A wireless home power grid , truly the wave of the future.In reality , though , this is truly a product that is far from being ready for prime time and is not the `` wave of the future '' powergrid you would think it is . More accurately it is an `` extension cord '' that transfers power via contacts in a totally traditional way.It ships with 3 tips that fit an infinitesimally small number of phone models . Unfortunately , not MY Blackberry nor MY cell phone . The design of the power tips prevent them from being used on any other device than the exact model specified.There are two glaring problems that Duracell should have considered and abandoned the whole concept of a power grid . One is that the location of the charging receptacle varies from phone to phone . On mine it was impossible to fit it in and have it connect to the included charging adapter.The other problem is the charging adapter itself . It is a fairly large disc that you have to glue to the back of your phone with double-stick tape . Whaaat ? Are you kidding me ? So to make it line up with the little charging tip it is probably 90 % likely to have to be glued over the phone 's camera , flash or rear speaker . That 's just plain dumb ! Not to mention , now you have a cell phone that you bought to be as small and convenient as possible , that you can slip into your pocket or purse or nice leather carrying case ... but no more ! With a fragile adapter sticking out of the side or bottom of your phone , plus the clunky odd-shaped stick-on disc , your phone no longer fits easily into pocket , purse or case and has to be handled with extreme care so the extra pieces do n't break off and get lost . Plus , with many phones that use a mini-USB connector , that same connector may be used for headphones , car speaker accessories or data access . So you have to remove the power tip each time . How is that more convenient than simply plugging the phone into a charging cord ? You can also get an optional overpriced `` powersleeve '' for a miniscule few devices which is a rubber boot that fits over the device with an awkward hump on the back and bottom of the device . Maybe a slightly better concept than the glue-on disc but so far I have seen them for only one model of iPod and one model of Blackberry.Another major failing of this products is that if you travel a lot you probably have to take a charging adapter with you . You certainly wo n't take the power grid . That means removing the power tip each time and reassembling it to use with the grid at home . That would get very old after the first time.I fail to see the slightest advantage to the entire product ; it 's like a bad April Fools joke . Someday someone will come up with a way to transfer electric power without wires ; I understand that technology already exists . When Duracell or someone else comes out with a power grid that does n't need ill-conceived adapters I 'll be interested.As far as the `` instruction manual '' goes , it is almost non-existent . For a product like this that most people have never used before , it is severely lacking.Sorry Duracell , I ca n't give this more than one star for `` interesting idea '' .	-1
I would like this product a lot better if:1 - The case actually provided real protection for the phone ( the plastic is n't exactly of the shock absorbing variety ) .2 - If you could charge in the car without having to remove the case ( the case hogs the port and does n't offer a piggy-back ) .3 - If the case allowed the user to sync to iTunes ( you have to remove it first ) .4 - If there were 2 cases included in the starter package.This charging grid is supposed to be convenient . I find nothing convenient about the fact that you ca n't sync or charge from your car without first removing the case . This would have been a slightly better system if 2 cases came with the starter kit as having the ability to charge 2 phones from one source really would be a benefit that might outweigh some of the negatives . However , investing in a secondary case is cost prohibitive , especially when the start-up costs are already pretty high . Sorry , but this compares badly against other merchants such as Powermat .	-1
I see no reason to own this item . You first must attach a small device to your phone . If you do not leave it on the phone , then every time you charge you must attach it . So why not just charge using your own device . If you leave it attached , then it sticks out and I ca n't use my protective case on my phone . Also , it only comes with devices for phones that do not fit my phone . You need to spend more money to get the connector for your phone.Forget this item . It is actually more difficult to charge your phone .	-1
I was excited to get this item because I thought it would be quick easy and convenient but I was wrong . The charging tips that fit into your phone were only for motorola and nokia . I have LG which is just as big as motorola , duracell does n't even make the adapter for it as far as I could find out . The charging pad is smaller then I thought , Its smaller than a mouse pad . Another dumb design is that you have to put a clip and stick it to the back of your phone , like I need more bulk on it . If you do n't want to adhere the clip you can spend another 35 bucks on a rubber sleeve that you can put on your phone , I already have one for protection I do n't need another.The whole thing works with magnets so both the clip , tip and charging mat is metal and looks like it will scratch fast . I 've seen connectors for the iphone , and xbox 360 controllers as well as the Wii and PS3 but those parts are another investment of 40 bucks . So unless you have a Blackberry , Nokia or Motorola phone with one of those mini usb style ports , DON '' T get this ! Duracell needs to go back to the drawing board and redesign it and have more charging tips included in the starter kits for LG and Samsung and iphone included ! ! ! Pros : *Only works with Motorola and Nokia out of the boxCons : *Does n't work with LG phones ( tips not made for it ) *iphones need additional attachment costing 35 bucks*Small Charging Mat Size*Other limited brand adapters cost 35-40 Dollars*Have to adhere a clip to the back of your phone	-1
The picture on the box , looks awesome . I did receive this as part of the vine program at amazon , so I did n't pay anything for this . For me , this is n't useful . I have several wireless gadgets , I have a kindle , an iphone , and samsung cell phone . I just retired my blackberry , and it charges it just fine , but I do n't use it anymore , so it is of little use for me . Does this work for how it is intended ? Yes . Can you really just plop down any cell phone on here and it works , no.I think that maybe the 2nd or 3rd generation of these will be awesome . I look forward to something that will work for any cell phone . I hate having to carry two cell phones ( one for work , and one for personal use ) , because this typically means one phone is low on charge . Now if you have the phone models listed on this box , this will work well for you , if you have two of the same cell phones , you are going to be purchasing another adapter for this , so this will increase your cost.Maybe my expectations are just too high , I know they are coming up with an iphone adapter soon . I think buying one of those wooden boxes that can house all of your cords for now is a better deal for the money . For now , for me , this is n't the right cell phone charger .	-1
I feel sad and guilty for ordering this item and causing environmental waste . Let me explain.The box contained one charging surface , one power clip , and 3 tips . 2 of the tips are for mini-USB sockets and another seemed to be intended for Nokia device . Our cell phones are Motorola , but none of the tips are suitable for our phones.Charging suface : Looks cool , no complaints.Power Clip : This is a thin , flat , tear drop shaped piece of plastic . You need one each of these things for every device you want to charge . They supply just one . You are supposed to stick ( built-in pre-glued surface exists ) to the back of your device . If you place your device in a holster , sleeve , or any other enclosure , then you can just forget it . Other surface of this flat clip has contacts that touch the charging suface facilitating charging of the device.Tips : One end of the tip goes into your device and the other end contacts the power clip . The tip projects out of the device - again causing problems in inserting the device into a holster.Why this is totally useless for me:1 ) Does n't work for my phones - tips do n't match and we use holsters for phones.2 ) Only things I can charge using this device is my GPS and MP3 player . We do n't charge them at home even once a week.For our purposes , following product works much better : Leviton L02-49686-00W 6 Outlet Adapter Grounded White	-1
In theory this product makes sense . In practice it does n't work that well.You plug a small adapter into the side of your phone and then you 're able to just place on the recharging pad.The adapter concept is still too bulky in practice . I have a protective case over my Blackberry and the only way to use the adapter is to remove the case - permanently . I do n't want to do that . I drop my phone at times and I need the case there . The convenience I gain from the recharger does not trump the protection I need for my phone.The adapter concept is severely limited . If your phone does n't work with the adapters provided you have to buy additional adapters . The same is true if you want to use the recharger for other items such as wii controllers . This ends up making this product even MORE expensive than what you initially think you 're going to pay.Lastly , it 's not clear what phones work with this recharger . For example , they say the Blackberry Curve will work with it . . . but there are models of Curve that do n't . All of this needs to be spelled out more clearly.If this charger cost about 25 bucks I 'd say consider it if it works for your specific phone and you do n't have a need for a protective cover on your phone like I have on my Blackberry . The outside adapter is OK in terms of size . Not ideal , but acceptable in terms of carrying your phone around . But in the end , it just seems like a gimmick . Easier just to buy additional adapters that work for your phone and leave them in places ( car , home work ) where you can recharge at will .	-1
This product is meant to be mistaken for an inductive charging system and has 3 major problems:1 . The box says it charges up to 4 devices -- well , two iPhones would just barely fit on it ... so you 'll not be charging 4 of those . The power supply that comes with this is a 1A power supply , and the iPhone itself needs more or less an amp to charge at full speed ... so you ca n't charge 2 iPhones at full speed.2 . When your product requires your customer to use a special case ... Make sure said case is not a ill-fitting and unattractive.3 . The case must be removed to sync , or charge off a normal charger.If you are willing to accept these limitations , all you win is the ease of not plugging in your iPhone when you get home ... Is it really that hard to do ?	-1
How it works : First of , as stated in the description , myGrid only supports Blackberry , Motorola and Nokia phones ( and not even all Blackberry phones ) . myGrid can charge up to 4 devices on the grid , but each one needs its own Power Clip or a Power Sleeve . After attaching either the Power Clip or fitting the Power Sleeve over your phone , you can place the devices on myGrid , which has to be plugged in into an outlet . myGrid then charges all 4 devices at once.Why it 's a waste of money : the package comes with only ONE Power Clip , so technically you ca n't charge 4 devices by just buying the starter kit . Power Clips and Power Sleeves sell on Amazon for $ 32.19 , so in order to charge the 4 devices , you 'll have to shell out close to $ 100 in addition to the $ 80 or so you just spent on the starter kit.I personally did n't want to keep the Power Clip on my phone all day , so I had to take it off after the charge was done ( Power Sleeves may be more convenient to keep on 24/7 ) . So after you go through the hassle of plugging in the myGrid contraption , fitting the clips to the devices and then taking them off once the devices is charged , you 've just wasted more time and effort than you would have just charging them the plain old fashioned way.All I could think of while using this gadget was what 's the point here ? Is it seriously so hard to charge these devices that someone would need to spend close to $ 180 for this contraption ?	-1
I , like many cellphone users , was really excited when this product was announced . Induction charging is the wave of the future of charging small portable devices ... unfortunately Duracell 's MyGrid is the stuck in the flood of the past ; still using connectivity to charge devices - albeit in a clunky , ugly , inconvenient way.For some reason I had in my head that the unit would utilize a tiny little dongle that would contain all the components needed to charge your phone . But , as I 'm sure you 've seen , the dongle connects to a bulky round disc which houses the charging system . On the disc are charging prongs which when mated to the base mat form a circuit for charging . So rather than look around for my cellphone charger I now look around for a bulky disc , not really more convenient . Of course I could tape the disc to the phone , increasing the phone 's girth and weight and rendering my cellphone belt useless ... but again that 's not really more convenient is it ? Frankly I do n't see a situation where anyone benefits from this device . Poorly thought out with aging tech . Avoid .	-1
What if something works great , just not for very long ? Two star review.This charger worked great for too-short awhile . Then it just quit working .	-1
I 'm not sure if it 's just the one seller `` panasystem corporation '' , but the product I received was indeed a Samsung charger , but came with a detachable USB cable with a NON-Micro USB plug as described in the product description/picture . While the charger could be used with one of my MicroUSB cables , the cable they sent me is useless and not even worth going through the refund/return process.The charger is rated at 0.7mAh which is barely enough to charge my Galaxy phone . 1A is needed for most of today 's smartphones , but this charger should be enough for a bluetooth headset . However , you 'll have to provide your own MicroUSB cable.Not recommended .	-1
Ok product . Like the title says it breaks very easy . Does what it claims though . Quality will depend on FM reception quality .	-1
Anyone considering this already well knows the dangers of driving and talking on your ever present cell phone . No matter what kind of dexterity and alertness you may have been blessed with , you are still challenging fate every time you decide to talk on the phone and drive . A tree or a telephone pole is just begging for your acquaintance the whole time . I picked up one of these Jupiter Jacks ( stupid name ) at a local discount store here . I drive a car with a stick shift that makes it extra hard to hold onto a phone and shift at the same time . For starters let me say that the Jupiter Jack , ( JJ ) is a very well thought out unit in its design . It mounts easily just about anywhere , while at the same time it is not so big and intrusive that it either gets in the way , or should spoil the looks for those of us more fashionably minded about our cars . It also has a good universal design for holding just about any kind of cell phone , and it comes with a variety of jacks for fitting your particular phone . The set up with your radio should take about 5 minutes once you have installed in on your dash.Unfortunately when it comes to JJs actually doing what it is supposed to do , the show is pretty much over after the above opening number . Despite the commercial on TV offering the impression that it pretty much transmits through your car radio as easily as a local station , it does n't come through any where near that clearly in real use . The signal does pretty much what cell phone signals do when you are driving around talking . They fade in and out and draw static here and there . Only with the JJ , it happens that much more often . When I installed mine I took a drive for about 30 minutes and called several people . None of the calls were what I would label a success , or came off as much of an improvement on JJs claims . Two of the calls withered and died , and I had to call them back the old fashioned way . Even when the JJ completed a call , the sound quality coming from the speakers was not any where near the fidelity of your regular stations . Not really full of static , but somewhat cheap and hard to decipher . I really did n't make any distinction between the quality of calls being disrupted by stronger signals close by , or just JJ being a piece of junk . Contrary to what the commercial I have seen says , my unit had two different frequencies that you could choose from . That may help those that are being interrupted by stations horning in on your signal , but it will not improve the technology of the JJ which is unfortunately not that good.In conclusion , the JJ is a very good idea that has your safety and convenience in mind . Whether you decide to take a chance on this unit or not , you should n't be driving and talking at the same time . But as far as recommending the JJ , it 's my opinion that in most cases you will be sorely disappointed . You will most likely find its habit of working and then not , dropping out , and even when it is as its best being a disappointment anyway , too much of a pain and end up going back to your bluetooth , or other ear phone system . I believe that after using this , any required wires hanging around your front seat wo n't seem all that bad . My take is pass this up ...	-1
I did n't like this . I tried useing it a couple of times and then went and bought a bluetooth . I gave them away at a yard sale .	-1
I 've tried three of these items ... from two different sellers . None of them worked with the mike in my headset ( which does work as I 've tested it with both an iPhone and a PC ) . Candidly , I despise Samsung 's use of proprietary port that is used for both charging the phone and connecting a headset . The seeming inability to get a working adapter just adds to the frustration . I 'm going back to my bluetooth earpiece with this Samsung phone .	-1
This battery i though it came in excellent condition but it turns that it was defective came out damaged with some round form in the middle and wont turn my phone	-1
I watched the bad reviews , but was hopeful because of some of the positive ones . I have an ancient RAZR that drives me crazy because it 's always out of juice . Well , this was a complete waste because even with this new battery -- charge lasts less than 24 hours . ugh.save yourself the time and money . buy locally and return the battery if it does n't work ... .like this one .	-1
literaly just opened it and it was broken at the top ... love it just doesnt look good BROKEN : / DONT BUY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
While you can get an iPhone 5 into this case , it 's extremely tight ( too short ) . On top of that the belt clip , while it seems very sturdy , is very hard to get on and off my belt . I do like the velcro closure of the flap . It makes me a lot more secure knowing that my phone is not likely to slide out but the case is simply too small for an iPhone 5 to slide into or ( much worse ) remove from this holster . Having said all this I must qualify this a bit . My phone does have a case on it so this could very well be the cause of my difficulty with this holster . But if it were just maybe 1/4 '' longer and the belt clip just slightly more loose it would be perfect . As it is it 's useable , just not easy .	-1
The cable actually does work , just not with Windows 7 . It 's a Pantech driver issue . I did n't try it on an XP machine , but if you have a windows 7 system , this is not the way to transfer your media to/from computer . Suggestion , use an SD card if possible .	-1
I do n't know what the devil this cable is for that was sent to me , but it definitely does n't even resemble the picture and it most certainly is not for a Pantech P7040P phone . It had two male usb ports of one end and a one female port on the other . It appears to be used to enable two two usb devices to be plugged into one port . Not the right item that I ordered .	-1
cheap , and works well for a few months , but stops working or starts getting a loose connection after only 5-6 months .	-1
This charger worked only for one month . After a month it would not charge my phone anymore . I am not satisfied with this product .	-1
I 've had this car charger now for about 6 months and although it does have a more rapid recharge rate than other chargers I 've seen , the connection to my android phone has become erratic . The connection is now loose and will only charge my phone if I hold it in at a certain angle . No other connectors that I have do this so I have ruled out my phone as the problem . Sucks ...	-1
just got today tried 2 different usb adapters and tried from the pc but none of them charge my phone ... . if i could give negative stars i would !	-1
This case should not be on the market.It honestly is not worth a quarter.The case is so thin and flimsy.The rhinestones are barley attached.Before I opened it , I could see there were missing rhinestones already.I returned this the next day.DO NOT BUY !	-1
Case makes phone difficult to hold in hand . Does not protect the phone at all and leaves little stones all over the place .	-1
This cover was a gift for my daughter , but it would n't stay on her phone . The plastic tabs did n't click together at all .	-1
not worth buying because when there isnt a single jewel left , it looks gross . i threw mine out . i wouldnt recommend it .	-1
after the first 3 days it all cracked up , turned a little bit yellowish , although it fits perfectly , the quality of materials is not the best	-1
It is not transparent , and it was very flimsy . This case did not meet my expectations I used it , it cracked , and I trashed it .	-1
this case only covers the back of the iphone ! the chrome border is still exposed , thus it 's prone to damage . the case also makes it hard to press the volume button . overall , it 's a cheap decent case .	-1
This case looks cool , but that 's where it stops . This case cracked the first time i put it on , and after a week it had cracks in all four corners . Its also great at collecting dust and grit . I suggest you try something like this : KingCase iPhone 3G & 3GS * Rubberized Slim Slider Twist Case ( Navy Blue & Black ) 8GB , 16GB , 32GB .	-1
shipping cost is 5 times the price of the product and I thought it was free because I bought others more than 50 $ ... the case just a normal transparent plastic	-1
This phone case only came with the back , no front included . Was not happy with the product . Would not recomment this for other customers .	-1
Just an ok case.offers no protection . I bought two and both broke in less than a month . You get what you pay for I guess	-1
I bought mine at radioshack for $ 64 . ** about a year ago . Very nice packaging nd display of the product . Other then that this is not a good or even an ok noise cancelling bluetooth . Everyone I call complains bout static in the background . It also has an awful echo . On a windy day everyone I call ends up hangup on me because all they hear is background noise . The built in command system can not even hear you . Then it guess what you said 9 out of 10 times . Do not waste your money , keep shopping around there has to be something better .	-1
I bought this product and it arrived very promptly ... once recieved it worked very well and I liked it , but about three weeks after usage the tip part connecting the earpiece and the ear cushion had broke off but I just super glued it and it worked for about a month after then it broke again but only in a different place . Between date of purchace and March of 2012 that thing had so many patch jobs untuil it was unrapairable ... i am contacting the seller today to see if the will replace this inferior version of a quality product . Keeping my fingers crossed !	-1
I have a Plantronics Voyager 520 . I recently got a new cell phone that does not have as good of a Bluetooth system as my older one , so I thought I 'd try to see if a newer , more expensive Bluetooth would work better with it . Nope . I have been using this BlueAnt model now for a few days , and I 'm stopping now . I 'm tired of restating everything on the phone , and people I know complaining that sound quality is crappy . The Voyager 520 costs about 1/2 or less what this one costs , and it 's quite superior on sound quality coming and going . I can highly recommend the voyaber 520 and I can not recommend this BlueAnt model at all . I do not understand how it has gotten as good of ratings as it gets in computer magazines.In addition to sound quality , the buttons are poorly placed on this BlueAnt model . Essentially , the on/off/call button and the volume up and down buttons are right where you want to touch the thing to get it settled in your ear ( also , something the Plantronics model does better ) . It 's annoying to activate things just by trying to get it better situated in your ear .	-1
I have had several bluetooth devices , and this one by BlueAnt was one of the best . Not only was I able to hear clearly even if I was in a crowded store ( you can adjust from 2 settings to maximize ) , but most importantly of all to me - it was incredibly comfortable . So comfortable that I forgot it was in my ear.So why the 2 stars ? Because despite being very careful with the way I took care of it , I have only had it a few months and it broke on me . It just sheared off right at the tip . I came here to read some reviews thinking maybe this was a fluke and I would order another , and see that others have complained about this very thing.This really is n't acceptable , and this was an expensive bluetooth and I expected better . I 'm not sure what to get now , but if anyone has any recommendations , I 'd love to hear them .	-1
I was very disappointed in this product for my Droid . My calls were tinney and staticy , and the update would n't work on my computer and customer service could n't seem to help me . The fit was comfortable enough , but I 'm looking for a lot more that in my BT ! I was thinking the voice commands would be great but it misunderstood me more times than not so it was frustrating . I went back to my Icon .	-1
Did n't fit very well and basically was a dust collector . I tried everything to get it tighter but nothing worked . Don'twaste your money . USB cable was garbage and so was the car charger .	-1
Bought it for the price and the design , did n't like the snapping of the covers . It was hard to put on and remove . Bought it for the moment just to get by .	-1
It did n't work at all because it did n't fit well . Never used it What more is there to say other than it did n't work .	-1
I ordered these basically because they were cheaply priced and am sad to say they are cheaply made as well ... I mean the plastic part seemed fine , they just do n't stick or stay put for long at all ( day or two ) ... I do n't like giving bad reviews , but am just being honest ; spend a couple more bucks and get one that will stick/last ( maybe that 's why they give you 3 ? ) ! !	-1
I purchased this phone hoping that it would be the end-all , high-powered , do-everything cell phone with computer functionality.However , what it is ... is , a high-powered COMPUTER with somewhat awkward cell phone functionality . Straight away , some might say , `` well buy a simple telephone . '' Nay ... I say to you , Nokia ought to be able to deliver it all - not parts of the puzzle . It should do it all , and it is close , but not quite there - yet.The problems with the cell phone functionality begin with a strange requirement to swap back-and-forth between `` landscape '' and `` portrait '' ( a 90-degree movement of your hand ) in order to initiate a phone call . This is obviously an oversight from the software developers who ( apparently ) were too busy designing the high-powered computer functionality of this `` device . `` Another problem ... the phone is extremely slick . It 's easy to drop . On the other hand , the device is extraordinarily beautiful - a work of art . However , I could n't figure out what type of case would protect it , yet not impede functionality . I did n't find a solution.Otherwise , the computer functions were amazing . And Nokia 's Ovi-store is nice , even if most of the apps are not quite what I was looking for . Nokia will get there.If you 're a computer geek ( e.g. , MS ) and like tinkering with computers to make them work - this is for you . However , if you enjoy an easy-to-use powerful interface that needs no human interference to just - work , you might not be very satisfied with this Nokia product.We own three other Nokias : E71 , and two E63s . All three are solid and function great as advertised . However , I can not recommend the Nokia N900 to anyone who first wants a cell phone , and 2nd robust smart phone functionality - no matter how powerful and amazing its computer within may be.I returned the phone .	-1
I was n't happy with my T-Mobile G1 and was intrigued by the Nokia N900 . I made the jump and now have gone back to the G1 , appreciating it all the more.Typing on the N900 is a horror . I thought the G1 keyboard was small -- the N900 makes the G1 feel like a classic Northstar . Now , that might seem like a small quibble . It 's true that the screen is larger , the resolution greater , the camera a real point-and-shoot replacement , the radios are strong ... but you 're going to be using the keyboard a LOT with an N900 . The apps are n't quite there yet . You 're going to be doing a great deal of gluing and crafting to get things to run at first -- expect to spend time in the root shell . For a programmer , that 's not so bad ... but coupled with a bad keyboard , it 's a deal-breaker.As a test , show me how to make a percent sign on the hard keyboard of an N900 . I 'll save you the trouble , you ca n't make one . You have to light up the symbol table and choose it on-screen.What 's more painful to me is the glacially-slow updates to the Nokia software , especially when compared to Google . Ovi Maps should have been turn-by-turn for N900s already ... where is this ? Why is MMS support an add-on ? Why is rotation such a difficult task on this device ? microUSB ? Really , I have to go get more adapters and cables now ? At least a 3.5mm headphone jack is there.By punting this over to developers , Nokia is saying that they can not solve your problems . They are n't leading in the space . Moreover , the muddled roadmap is killing them . Developers want minimal targets , and Nokia keeps changing the targets . OS2006-8 , Maemo , Meego ... sorry , NoGo . EasyDebian is an interesting *TOY* , it 's not the end game , not with all the difficulty around porting existing apps to be functional on a small screen.Here 's the minimum Nokia needs to succeed with this device , with this platform and program : -one target roadmap , fully detailed , and predictable ; -more frequent shipping of code , even in point releases , to develop a culture of success , progress , and momentum ; -crushing the outstanding UI issues and expected functionality complaints by delivering ; -provisioning real ARMEL tools to get as many existing Debian apps onto their platform as possible.In short , they have to make it as easy as Android development , and give devs a single SDK target . There 's too much flux , too much unsettled , and the N900 reflects that . I wish this phone was more polished , I do . I might have been able to accept the awful keyboard if it had more finished functionality , but in the end , it 's going back. -- #	-1
[ Edit - Jan 24 , 2010 Update : Two firmware updates a couple weeks ago so after testing , time for an update : If you NEED bluetooth like I do and do n't plan to carry two phones/devices to have bluetooth available , read on.So little progress has been made and I have seen far too many bugs/enhancements closed as WONTFIX that I am dropping this to 1-star based on current state , 2 updates and price to value in comparison with other devices that have launched/will launch in the next month or so . I 'll change the rating depending on next update - length of wait will be factored in . I see a lot of bashing for people who give low reviews so I expect I 'll hear about this.I 'll start by quoting Nokia from bug 6766 regarding bluetooth problems on the phone . This came after the major PR1.1 update : '' As far as making all issues go away , I do n't think that 's physically possible since Bluetooth and WLAN share the same antenna in the N900 . Some WLAN operations , such as searching for access points , take over the antenna almost completely . `` All the bluetooth bugs still exist , some are made worse by PR1.1.Note : regardless of what people say , there is NO way , zero , none , nada , to turn off the wifi radio via graphical interface . You can probably do so via CLI if you are very advanced with Linux and not worried about re-flashing , but that 's not practical . You can take several steps to make it `` less active '' , but it is still running - easiest to see is choose `` Internet Connections '' from the status area and it will show all wifi APs even though you think it is disabled . Nokia closed an enhancement request to allow customers to fully disable the wifi radio as WONTFIX.The major update of the two , known as PR1.1 , was eagerly awaited and expected to fix a lot of problems including the well known , very active , bluetooth bugs . Nothing I listed has been addressed and the firmware addressed a few minor things overall-nothing major . Important to note that the manifest list posted for PR1.1 lists A LOT of bugs as fixed that were actually fixed before the phone was released . I have noticed a lot of people 's tones have changed since the disappointing update.PR1.1 : Bluetooth : The PR1.1 update did help some who had a lot of issues with 'stuttering ' on bluetooth ( music and calls ) . For most of us , it did n't . One person who initially seemed happy and said he 'd live with it came back a day or two later and said it 's not fixed . Long story short , read bug 6766 on maemo 's bug site . For me and others , PR1.1 has increased disconnections to a point that I do n't bother trying to use BT now . It essentially disconnects immediately . When I was testing PR1.1 , a couple times the connection lasted several minutes , but the majority is instant disconnect . If you need bluetooth , I would hold off.Portrait mode : They are working towards it , that 's good . The browser has a partial implementation now ( it 's nice for one handed reading , good formatting , but not complete ) . Tip : you have to hit a combination of shift+ctrl+O to activate it ; it works with keyboard slider in only . To disable , shift+ctrl+O again . However , I have 'remnants ' of the future with my desktop sticking in portrait randomly requiring a restart . Not a huge deal unless you are in a hurry to make a call.USSD codes : The * # nnn # nnnnnn # to do many controls on your phone like say , enable full forwarding since it is not available in the interface or check prepaid balance , etc . etc . They fixed a couple codes : show your IMEI and show the software version ( both available in settings | 'about phone ' right next to each other ) . They closed this bug as fixed - a lot of very unhappy people on this one . I think Nokia ( well , probably Maemo since they do n't know phones yet ) really underestimated how important this is - it is clear from the huge bug thread that a lot of the codes people need are surprising to them.Maps : It starts up a little quicker . A few minor tweaks that are n't worth mentioning . I was hoping I could at least do routing to an address . You can , but open your browser and go to google maps.Anything else I do n't mention , there is nothing to mention . It was an underwhelming update that decreased battery life further , addressed several small issues . Some had ZERO votes and only 1 person involved with the ticket and it was very small - e.g . RDS name in the FM transmitter ? ? ? . Clearly poor prioritization.Other stuff : The battery charges much faster now , but it also drains much faster . There are some great apps starting to show in the pipeline . A lot of hard work from the community going on and new things are showing up daily in devels and testing repositories . They just are n't hitting extras ( production ) fast enough.BTW - my review is not meant to be 'negative ' - I am simply stating known issues that a potential buyer may not know . I just have n't repeated the positive or taken the speculative position of hoping to see the potential realized . My intent is very simple : provide a different view that is n't one of infatuation that simply repeats the specs on the Nokia site . Provide information that would have had me think twice before purchasing . I know what you might be thinking : would I repurchase it now ? No . Not then and not now.End update ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -I 've had the N900 over a month so I 'm familiar enough with the N900 now to write comfortably.I had high expectations and loved the N900 for the first 2-days . Every day since I 've grown more disappointed . I should have sent it back for a refund w/in the first couple weeks ( pre-ordered from Nokia ) . But , I was optimistic on the potential , which has withered as I 've watched Nokia/Maemo do not-so-amazing things on [ ... ] . The N900 is not complete - not even close . They 've left out a lot of what we have grown to love and expect with other current smartphones ( this really does n't qualify as a tablet ) . Time on [ ... ] has me very discouraged . They are very focused on Maemo 6 and it 's obvious they consider Maemo 5 primarily in maintenance mode.I am still amazed that they released the N900 as is . Bugs , I expect , but I did n't expect it to be missing some very basic features that are now standard . I also did n't expect them to turn actual bugs into low priority enhancements or completely dismiss them as `` WONTFIX '' . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -Some quotes from Maemo/Nokia on [ ... ] : If the reporter expects the feature to be officially supported then it is a WONTFIX [ common comment ] I think I can resolve this as WONTFIX entirely , since the feature can be perfectly covered by the community . [ This is to create a function to disable/enable wifi ] Is n't `` Settings - > About '' a more user-friendly way to look up the same ? [ This is about the lack of support of using USSD codes - simply weird ] -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -One review mentioned it 's built with steel , aluminum , rubber and plastic . Wish I could find more than plastic . It is very 'plasticky ' , feels fat , heavy and it looks cheap - nothing like the picture . It looks & feels like a digital camera you might have purchased 5-years ago . How did DROID get essentially the same internals into such a thin form factor and Nokia managed to make it look 10-years old ? There are many positives about the N900 ( and it does have strong *potential* ) . Many were written about . I wo n't re-write them . However , I will note many 'gotchas ' that you would not expect from a 'flagship ' phone from any manufacturer . The aggregate of the gotchas add up to borderline unusable ( in my opinion ) . I 'm not going to list everything , but will put down what would have me think twice about buying . I should have waited for an update or two . I ca n't say it looks promising though.Below are known issues . One is not confirmed by Maemo/Nokia , but the majority are WONTFIX or being left to the `` community '' ( i.e . not Maemo/Nokia ) - with a couple pushed for *consideration* for Maemo 6 ( Harmattan ) . Bluetooth they `` think '' may be fixed in a future update . USSD codes they seem to be looking at ( but have n't seen a confirmation of fix ) .I have noticed Nokia leaves it for the community to implement many basic features . Why would they bother with basic features for one of the most expensive phones out there ? Even if you want an open platform and are familiar with Maemo , you would n't ( least I do n't ) expect them to push so much to be done by the community . Android does n't take things that far - sure , it 's 'mostly ' open , but they package the basics with the Android builds.- OS : It appears Fremantle ( Maemo 5 that comes on the N900 ) is essentially in maintenance mode already . I 've spent weeks on [ ... ] and watched as they apply `` WONTFIX '' to many basic features that were reported as missing , marked true bugs as enhancements and low priority ( e.g . does n't allow you to use USSD codes - * # ... # ) , sent enhancement requests to their `` brainstorming '' site , and many requests they accept are assigned to *possible* Harmattan ( Maemo 6 ) inclusion.What does this mean ? It 's possibly outdated already.- LINUX : Better know Linux . Due to the lack of settings and missing granularity in those that exist , you 'll need to know Linux to make many changes/check certain settings . If you do , it 's just a pain to make changes via the terminal rather than using a GUI.- SETTINGS : There are very few settings . The settings that exist have very little granularity . No easy wifi on/off , only two profiles ( general and silent ) with very little available to configure . Click 3-4 times just to change the display brightness . No way to set a 'home ' desktop that you and I are used to -nor is there a way to get to a particular desktop easily besides using both hands and swiping . Plenty more.- BLUETOOTH : Nearly unusable . There are two major , known issues : 1 ) it uses the same antennae as WiFi so if you have wifi on ( takes 7-steps to disable it fully ) , bluetooth headsets are unusable : too much static heard on both ends , A2DP music has static and pauses , file transfers run around 20kbps and disconnect often . 2 ) Constantly disconnects . Live in a state/country where you must use hands-free while driving ? Do n't like holding the phone to your ear for long calls ? Want to type while on the phone ? Want mobility while you talk ? You ca n't . It disconnects anywhere from instantly to several minutes . Upon disconnection , the sound does n't transfer to the handset . It normally takes a power cycle to get things reoriented.- WIFI : Looking for an easy way to disable wifi when not using it ? Sorry , we 're not talking 1-2 steps for Android or 3 for iPhone , it takes 7-steps to disable ( you have to assume it 's disabled - no way to tell if the radio is off and maemo/Nokia have n't said for sure ) and re-enable . Reported as a bug on [ ... ] - they consider it an enhancement , pushed it off to Harmanttle as possible inclusion and said they 'll let the community write something for Maemo 5 ( nothing in the pipeline as of this writing ) . Hope you do n't need to disable/enable wifi often.- BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD : Sorry . Several other smartphones support , but the N900 does n't . I have an N810 and many of us expected the N900 to take its place as a tablet , but with a phone . Nokia/Maemo 's official response ? Not supported it and it wo n't be . They 've marked several submitted bugs on this as WONTFIX . There is a way to get a BT keyboard to pair ( if you know Linux ) , but do n't bother , it does n't support typical PC-105 layout and only some letters will work.- LANDSCAPE : I did n't think landscape would be that bad . It supports portrait in phone ( if you can get it to move to portrait ) , but that 's it . It is a BIG pain , especially if you want to use the device with one hand . Just entering a 5-digit PIN to unlock with one hand is very difficult . It might be livable , but the implementation is very poor.- MAIL FOR EXCHANGE ( MfE ) : Far too many bugs to mention here . Barely usable - supports HTML now , but a few steps backward everywhere else . I 'll hit a few : Does n't properly map fields ( both contacts and calendar ) , does n't synchronize updates properly , does n't seem to properly support the EAS protocol in general , wo n't properly synch with Google 's EAS implementation ( they said this is n't supported ) , etc.- MAPS : Ca n't use maps without a network connection . If you download map files - still no go . Also , Ovi Maps 1.0 takes ~10-minutes ( sometimes longer ) to locate your position . GPS is on , but Maps shows it 's not active much of the time . I 've found no way to route to an address ; only two options : point to it on a map or type in a city/state/country in a search dialog - ca n't search for an address . Very slow . Pretty much useless unless you want to know you are sitting on the right couch . No clue what Nokia was thinking with this.- GPS/CAMERA : If you want proper geo-tagging , you 'll need to buy another device . GPS on , but photo is not tagged . It will tag sometimes if you have network positioning on.- BASICS : Are you looking for standard/basic functionality that your other phones you 've had over the last few years have ? The N900 is missing a lot . Far too many to list , but in addition to what 's already been mentioned a few are : word suggestion is poor with no auto-correct ( even a standalone `` i '' is not capitalized and it does n't work in some areas ) , ca n't use USSD codes , no unconditional call forwarding , ca n't select different ring tone for contacts , ca n't mark contacts to automatically go to VM , ca n't change amount of ring time before going to VM , etc.- EMAIL CLIENT : Tinymail-based ( not bad ) . Very poor implementation and the email client is very limited . Ca n't highlight text and copy , does n't synch any folder but inbox and sent ( you can view other IMAP folders , but if you delete an item - it 's gone for good - no synch and no trash on N900 , drafts stay on phone , etc. ) . Maemo/Nokia are on record saying this will never happen because `` it 's too complex '' ( common saying [ ... ] ) , but look for it in Harmattan - maybe . Does n't auto-fill/suggest as you type a name in TO/CC/BCC . No choice to return to inbox after deleting a message - you can only view the next message.- EMAIL CLIENT : Have to confirm each and every delete . There is no option to remove confirmation . If you deal with a high volume of email , it 's a big irritant . It 's been submitted as an enhancement request with Nokia 's current response as `` It would be interesting to how popular such request is '' : -/ Weird that such basic functionality in every email client ( mobile or not ) that I can think of is n't on the N900 or its roadmap.Very poor email client - worst I 've seen on a mobile device in years.This does n't include all issues , but the review is long enough . Hopefully it helps with a bit of a different perspective by someone who has gotten over the infatuation and spent a lot of time working with Nokia/Maemo .	-1
These screen protectors were very chunky and I could not get them to go on my phone correctly . I cleaned my screen before applying them , and still no luck .	-1
hate this , it has some stickers that come on the protector that is a pain to remove without damaging the plastic itself , a complete waste of time , plus it 's a bubble machine , no joke .	-1
The item was easy to install ; however , compared to other screen covers , it is too soft , and therefore leaves behind many noticeable bubbles .	-1
i would buy a screen protector for a blackberry ever again not worth dont buy it not much else to say	-1
I received them later than supposed , so since i was on a trip , I could n't get this product . Bad experience ...	-1
This Procter does not stick on my device can I have a refund .	-1
Def not buying any of these ! Rips in half and it does n't work at all/ it does n't stick right and I wasted money for nothing -_-	-1
I had ordered this product before and I was extremely happy with it . However , when I ordered it a second time , I did not receive the same product . They were not matte finish but more of a glossy one . I could see myself in the reflection which should n't happen with matte . I 'm sad ! : (	-1
this item is not worth the money spent on it . It can not stand up to being used . do n't spend any money on this item	-1
I would n't get this again , it is a nice screen protector but it has very little if any affect as a privacy screen .	-1
& # 34 ; Ocean-City is committed to providing each customer with the highest standard of customer service & # 34 ; This has got to be some kind of joke when it takes a month to recieve such a small and simple item . I should have checked more into this companies shipping policies , but I based it on the customer reviews which I am begining to think may have been submitted but the company employees . There standard shipping policy is up to a month on all items . Utterly ridiculous . I could have gotten a similar product from 100 other shippers , but at less than 2 dollars I was being cheap . You get what you pay for ( I paid almost nothing and thats what I got ) .	-1
really hard to see when u want to text or call anyone specially when you are outside the mirror looks and works fine .	-1
This protector is fine but it is definitely not anti glare . Also , you can usually find a 3 pack somewhere on here for the same price .	-1
I like that the mirror screen works when the phone is off , but when the phone is on , there is a weird rainbow effect that makes me dizzy . I will probably replace it when my new screen protector arrives .	-1
When you trust a picture you 're always going to be letdown . While they do cover the screen they 're not as reflective as they appear in the photo . If you need an inexpensive screen protector this is not a bad way to go just as long as you really do n't want to use it as a mirror .	-1
I would n't even give this thing a rating it deserves a no rating but that 's the only way to write a review . Never get this I should have listened to the many reviews about this junk	-1
i really thought i would like this but i got so many bubbles and i ended up crumpling it and tossing in the trash because i got frustrated trying to fix it	-1
phone shield makes rainbow colors cant see iPhone screen at all no matter which position and brightness .cheap price	-1
These screen protectors are horrible ! They glare & have this hazy effect to them . Not only that , but the screen also looks grainy when using my phone.This was the worst screen protector I 've ever bought.They also do n't align ! It 'll fit perfect by my front camera , but off when it comes to my home button & when aligned with the home button , it 's off by the front camera . That annoyed me so much ! I 'm good at putting on screen protectors & these were just one big disappointment .	-1
Horrible , ca n't see my phone in my apartment , let alone outside in the day light , WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY ! Seller shipped decently fast , nothing to call home to mom about , but the product is horrible , the sticky adhesive also stretched during the application process and caused an & # 34 ; abrasion looking & # 34 ; mark in the middle of the screen ! Buyer beware , even if it fits , you can not see what is on your screen .	-1
They are pretty good at doing their job , that is if you can get them on right . They are a big hassle to get on and if they start to peel the whole thing will come with it .	-1
This product is not what is advertised . They are glossy , and allow fingerprints dominate the screen . Reported this to the seller , and received a reply stating that it is the only kind they have.Now on the other hand , this product is constructed well , and is a perfect fit .	-1
Poor quality ... Peels up and bubbles around the edges , especially if you have any type of case . Surface is poor too , very & # 34 ; orange peel & # 34 ; looking.Unless you just really like chrome and want it as cheap as possible I 'd pass .	-1
I just got these in the pail . Put one on my phone and immediately was disappointed . It makes the screen have a bluish tint with the rainbow effect when you move it around and I get a headache just looking at the screen . It looks like I have 3d glasses on and am walking around in the sun . Definitely do n't recommend and if I could upload a pic to this review I would , it 's terrible	-1
Returned this . It 's simple just a metal stand ! You can get a case or cover that has a clip to pull out for a stand , This is definitely not worth the price charged .	-1
I absolutely loved the color and feel of this cover . It fit my phone like a glove and stayed put unlike other sliders I 've tried . However , after like 2 weeks the color started to fade . It faded so bad I had to trash it and order the metallic version . Still waiting for it to arrive , hopefully it is of better quality .	-1
I was so excited to get this case and it was an AWESOME color . Within a couple of weeks , it started losing color at the top ( where the sunshine hits it when it 's in the car holder ) and it has subsequently lost color where it is held a lot around the sides . A little more than a month later , it 's splotchy enough looking that I 'm researching a better replacement . Too bad , it fits my phone nicely and is great protection . The color fading is just very disappointing .	-1
Maybe I just got a defective case , but it has already cracked through near the sync cable port . I 've contacted support to file a claim on warranty and hope to have a replacement one shortly .	-1
Based on all the rave reviews , I thought I would really love this case . I do n't . The material is rubbery as I expected but what I did n't expect was for it to be so loose around the sides . It will just flip right off if there was n't the clear plastic support on the back to hold it tight . That plastic piece looks so cheap and tacky . My phone will not fit on my iHome for charging with this cover on . I have to take off the clear plastic piece to be able to manipulate the rubber on the bottom to fit it onto the charger . I purchased this during the Gold Box special for $ 15 and I do n't even consider it a value for that price . I plan to move back into my ifrogz case which I also do not love but at least it has a snug fit and will sit on my iHome . I would not recommend this case to a friend .	-1
This is my first otter case . The concept and design are pretty good . I have owned 2 Speck Candy shell cases previously and both have served me well . They offer superior protection due to their hard plastic covering which protects all 4 corners of the phone as well as the back - fully covered except for the camera hole . The design does not interfere with keyboard access or cause the edge of a screen protector to pop up.So why did I switch ? The speck is a one piece design and remarkable , except for one thing . The thin portion of the frame near the bottom of the phone 's face eventually cracks and then breaks off over time . The case remains fully functional and still offers great protection , but you have a broken case that eventually becomes a bothersome eyesore.The Commuter case is a compromise for me . It 's slightly slimmer than a speck and is comfortable to hold . It offers good protection , but not the same level afforded by a case that has a rigid shell at all four corners . If the commuter case had this , it might be 4 stars . The commuter is not the case you want to rely on to protect your phone in case of a fall . On to carpet , no problem . On the cement , you might need a new screen . No one plans to drop their phone , but accidents do happen . If the need arose , I do n't see myself buying another commuter case . I 'd have to opt for something with a little more protection in the corners . The Otter defender series or another brand altogether.Update - After 3 months of ownership I will be going in another direction . The case does offer a medium amount of protection , but the rubber flaps that cover the plugs for the headphones and charge/sync port are a pain to deal with . Fumbling to plug in while driving and/or docking to charge the phone at night.Final update : Lowering my review to 2 stars . Look elsewhere for good 3GS protection and ease of use . The case is comfortable to hold , and offers a basic level of protection , but the speck is better all the way around , even after the frame breaks . I dropped my 3GS many times ( on cement ) and it never showed a mark thanks to the Speck . This particular Otter is a fail , and the rubber flaps while well intentioned to keep dust and moisture away keep you from docking , charging or connecting headphones easily . After 3 yrs , I 'm ready for a new phone anyway .	-1
This was purchased to replace a broken case , and it did n't work . The case would not stay on as it kept on slipping off . I had to return it .	-1
Today I received the Jabra C250 and the Jabra C500 headsets . The C500 is better designed for use with cellular phones but the sound quality in the ear piece and microphone is not as tood at the C250 . The person I called compared the two devices and said the C250 was like AT & T wireless voice quality ( talking in a tunnel ) . The C250 was also a bit more comfortable in my ear .	-1
This model , the C500 , is one of 4 Jabra headsets I have ordered . I continued to try different Jabra models because the ear piece is by far the most comfortable and best sound quality I have ever used , however , all 4 Jabras had very poor microphone quality . With each one , the persons on the other end could not hear me . Disappointed . I found that it worked well with a cell phone , but almost no volume on a cordless phone .	-1
I was n't expecting it to last a lifetime , but it stopped working after 2 weeks of using it . the connections on the head snapped , and i could only hear people when i bent the cable a certain way . this worked for a few days and then the headset stopped working completely .	-1
i bought these headphones because i like to go to sleep listening to music ... i wanted the headphone to be thin enough so i can sleep on them and i want it to be bluetooth ... it meets these 2 requirements but ... it has a major flaw ... when the volume is set at the lowest setting , it is very loud ... i mean teenager loud ... it 's so loud that i doubt anyone could fall asleep with the sound level ... it 's loud enough that you could hear the music great on low while on the commuter train or in the public ... on the plus ... the fit is perfect for me ... and ... the sound is superb ... even while blasting ... i do n't know how long the battery will last since i ca n't listen to it for very long because of the volume problem ... i called jabra ... they are working on a software fix ... but ... have no release date ... so ... buy at your own risk ...	-1
I usually do n't leave reviews unless I can remain positive for the most part but I really feel like I need to voice my opinion about this product . I am one of those people who think they can read all the negative reviews and then think it will be better for me because I am really good with this stuff . I was dead wrong.I have wanted a pair of these for a very long time now but after only a week with these things I have had nothing but problems , -Half the 'felt ' from the headband is already falling off . It 's all over my head every night and very annoying and makes the product look terribly cheap.-The cheesy fold to power off/ power on is a complete joke and the hinges feel extremely fragile to me and likely to last less than a few months at most . This means there is no way to wear them around your neck if out and about with no other way to hold them and wish to have them turned off . And it also means you have to fold them in order to charge with out interfering with your backup bluetooth headset . I found this to be a very annoying problem becuase I wanted to avoid hinging them as much as possible because of the cheap hinge feel.-The charging indicator works nothing like advised in the manual . You plug it in and the battery blinks red for 2 hours and then just turns off . It never turns to green like it is supposed to and unless it does it wont turn on . The first charge took over 4 hours , 2 hours blinking red and then turned green after another 2 hours of no indication light at all . The second charge I had it plugged in for 5 hours , it blinked red for the first 2 hours and then did nothing for the next 3 hours and when I went to use them the battery was still dead ! -Terrible , uncomfortable fit that will have your ears throbbing within the hour and a design that in no way attempts to stay flat against your ears or stay even remotely positioned on your head in an active environment.-Constant clicking and static sounds heard during silent periods between songs/during pause time.-It is not possible to initiate voice commands with the headset . Long pressing the center button only puts it in pairing mode to pair with multiple devices at the same time . Seriously a bluetooth hands free headset that can not initiate voice commands so I can make a call ? -Jabras customer support declined to respond to my emails or call me despite their *STOP DO NOT RETURN TO STORE* labeling . I gave them a fair chance to support their product and they declined.+On the bright side when they did work the phone calls were crystal clear and music sounded amazing with deep rich lows and crisp vibrant highs with plenty of volume even when working in noisy environments with power tools . No call complaints what so ever.+Volume controls worked very well , precise and consistent for me . EVEN with my work gloves on.Promptly returned . BUYER BEWARE.The JayBird Sportsband is a far superior product in almost every way.JayBird Sportsband Bluetooth Headphones ( Midnight Black )	-1
I 've been looking for a set of low-profile BT headphones for a while , and thought the Halo looked pretty good . The sound quality was great , but these headphones do n't feel like they 're going to last very long - I 've only had them for a day and already the crappy plastic hinges have gotten very loose . I can see where they are already starting to wear . They are also really uncomfortable on the ears . It 's a shame that such a cool design was done so poorly .	-1
I started this journey by ordering one from Amazon . It was dead on arrival . Would not charge . I returned it and got a replacement . Same thing . Red light flashes for a few seconds to minutes then goes out . No green light EVER . Returned it . Got yet another . Same exact problem . To make a long story short , I just got the 5th one today . Brought it home , plugged it in and red light starts flashing . After about 5 minutes , light goes out . Dead . Nada . At this point , it is just laughable . I know it is not my issue since it is the same socket I use to charge my Jabra BT530 and it works fine . Know what ... .the thing is going in the recycle bin , and I hope I never ever see one of these things again .	-1
I read all the reviews before buying , and just thought the complaints were from people who were not tech-savvy . Wrong . I consider myself to be a tech and computer expert . Still , you need a manual to tell you how to make a call , and perform other basic tasks . That is absent here . The `` quick start '' document that comes with the product is worthless , has English and Spanish versions mixed together , and only shows you a picture of the buttons , and tells you how to pair the device . No help for the true functions of the device.My device had hardware failure out of the box . FM transmitter did not work . Power on / off button worked only intermittently . I had to find out the following the hard way . ( 1 ) the Jabra web page , support site has NO way to submit a tech support request , NO phone contact number . The only thing you can get there is a brochure advertising their headsets . ( 2 ) . there is NO USA phone support line - you can call for help only in Australia , China , Singapore , Japan.With no instructions , it was a bit tough for me to figure out that I had a true hardware failure . But finally it became clear to me the FM transmitter was just broken . The on / off switch was not reliable . Many times you could not turn the speaker on.this unit is getting returned . now that I am aware of the complete lack of support from Jabra , would never recommend buying from them again . I 've had earpieces from them in the past which were adequate - but now I know that when you need help you have no way of getting it . Please avoid Jabra and get another product.I owned this for 5 hours before returning it.Ratings : looks : 9/10 . stylish black plastic . But the smooth finish is awful for fingerprints.function : 5/10 : does pair easily with any bluetooth phone . will play songs from the phone . will answer the phone and hang up the phone for you . Will shut itself off after 10 minutes if no activity . has separate on/off switch making it easy to shut off when you leave the car . Unfortunately for me : on/off switch broken . FM tranmitter did not work . If all things worked as promised this would be a fantastic device , but not so.reliability : 0/10 : during my 5 hour ownership . would periodically lose its connection with my phone , then re-connect . The FM transmitter turned on once for only 5 seconds then shut itself off . other than that the FM transmitter never worked at all . The on / off switch failed . You could turn the unit on only intermittently.Construction : 5/10 : The thin plastic construction does not give you any confidence for durability . I 'm afraid if I dropped it from a foot or more it would shatter . Construction very cheap . Ca n't believe this would last more than two months for normal use.Instructions / manual / support : 0 / 10 . Wish I could give a negative number here . If you do n't believe me visit jabra dot com and click on `` support '' -- - see for yourself that you have no way of asking a question nor of getting help .	-1
I would not purchase this again . Its junk and is a pain to use . Mine is in a kitchen drawer and will be sold at the next yard sale .	-1
I had great expectations for this , but I am more than disappointed.Like many others have reported here , the unit is FOREVER dropping the connection and the re-connecting . Just a plain pain ! As others have also said , the `` instructions '' are USELESS..at best.And , most irritating to me of all is that I 've not been able to figure out if this thing allows you to initiate OUTGOING calls . If it does , can someone please tell me how ? I 've had two other car Bluetooth speaker phones and it has been simple to make a call by pushing one button . Maybe I 've missed something in the `` instructions , '' but there is nothing even remotly user friendly about this thing.Based on my experience to date I can not recommend this unit and I would likely never purchase another Jabra production in the future .	-1
I had the Jabra SP700 which worked fine . I gave that one to my husband and bought the Cruiser . Well , sorry the Cruiser did n't work fine for me . I got complaints from callers that I was echoey and sometimes static sounding or I keep breaking up . And this was happening without me even using the FM stereo option . I tried everything I could think of repairing etc but I kept getting the same response from callers about coming in all choppy . I returned it . I 'll have to steal back my Jabra SP700 from my husband . LOL .	-1
Recipient did not find the case any easier to use than a pocket is . I also have the same case and I use mine more often .	-1
