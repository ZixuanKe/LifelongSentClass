This is a fun & colorful version of the usual bingo ... .I like it quite a bit.It 's great for all ages .	1
This is a great game to play . The music is going all the time and you can still understand the caller .	1
Fast paced easy to play game quick action and nice extra bonuses , like all the new levels in far away places	1
I love this game . Play it all the time on my Kindle Fire HDX . Best bingo App . Never had a problem plkaying it .	1
Just downloaded , but it seems to be working much better than the game it replaced . If it keeps up , I 'll give it five stars .	1
I downloaded the game a few weeks ago and I could n't get it to play a t first . Restarted the Kindle and it worked right away . Only problem I have with it right now is the instant wins do n't work correctly . The game records a bad call and I lose the cards and the bingo win .	1
I like playing Bingo , but sometimes I spend to much money . That is my fault not yours . I really like playing Bingo .	1
I really like this bingo . If you like the game bingo.you will like this one . You can play in different places around the world .	1
This game is a lot of fun . It has beautiful scenery in it . Come and play and have fun all day .	1
So far , so good . I already played it on Facebook . I used to have it on my iPhone , but it kept crashing . I 've played it a couple times on my Kindle Fire HD and it 's been perfect : ) Great , fun game !	1
I like playing this game . The graphics are good , I also like the pace that the balls are called.Enjoy playing this game to relax before bedtime .	1
Bing world is great to play especially if you 're looking for something to pass time . I would definitely recommend it for everyone .	1
I love to play this game and try to every day . It is a great way to kill time and easy to play .	1
I really enjoy playing . Wish you could convert coins to chips or chips to coins . Other wasnice	1
I love this app ! My 3 year old daughter records herself singing the music & amp ; now I have a precious keepsake I will keep forever . I also love how they say other scriptures and explain them in ways kids can understand . Great app for anyone raising godly children .	1
My daughter enjoyed this game . It 's a cute girly game . The graphics are good and its a very pretty looking mermaid which my daughter liked .	1
More mermaids , clothes , jewels , friends and back drops would be nice . It would be also nice if they did something other than just stand there swim maybe .	1
So cute and child friendly my nine month old uses it . It gives us that bonding moment . It also helps her to stay ahead of her age group .	1
I got this and tricked my brother ! He was fooled for a long time for like a week or more ! Lol	1
it is not that bad I love it alot so say what you want I like you have your opins I have mine leave it at that	1
I have not had a chance to really use yet , still trying to figure things out . I see a lot of potential for my usage . I am not so much for highlighting and making my pictures & # 34 ; artsy & # 34 ; , I have some other picture apps for coloring , red eye , cropping , different effects that I do n't really use . I just want to try to improve my regular pictures , making minor defect corrections and so forth . I like that they have a lot of tutorials , I am still working alot with that aspect . Maybe with time and usage I can give 5 stars .	1
that is finaly on amazon appstore , i waited it for 1 month to see that on here , thank you dev , i bought it insantly as I promised	1
I really like this for using when I am doing my personal reading at work . I was a little shocked at the price though .	1
it make sbible reading much easier when out . It is easy to navigate as well as convenient . thanks for your work in making it available..	1
Easy to use when taking notes . No need to flip thru pages . When I 've forgotten where to find one of the smaller books , it is easy to locate it in the blocks .	1
Tried this and liked it very much.one thing I really like is it does n't need all of your private info.that in itself earns 5 stars as well.hope it does mature wit time .	1
This app works great on my Kindle Fire HD . I listen to the I Heart Radio all the time and it nice to be able to adjust the sound . I found it easy to use . I took away a star because I ca n't adjust the sound while watching a movie or tv.For the FAOTD , Ca n't go wrong .	1
There are two kind of the EQ on the markets for the smartphones . Firs of a kind demands of you to disable parts of the sistems tuning . The other ones leave you to dicede and that is much , much better . It is working anyway . Only you decide when you wont to enable EQ . For example you will need it while listening radio , but you do n't need it alongside EQ in the almost any better players and this is that kind of EQ . Works really grey , and I recommend it as a must have one .	1
As I sat listening with very expensive headphones I could n't imagine my music sounding much better , but I am pleased to say that this app has proved me wrong ! The sound improvement is significant . It works with audio programs not listed , but the VU meter does n't work on some programs , but that is tolerable . What 's really missing is a true widget . When you run it , you have a widget of sorts , but you do n't have a widget to keep on your desktop if you want it . I was going to rate it a 4 because of the shortages but the sound improvement is significant enough to merit all five stars regardless .	1
I did have this app till my kindle restarted itself . it is amazing for all type of genera it just sucks it 's not free anymore ... fix that amazon .	1
Easy to adjust treble or bass to your liking and once you get it set up not to much more to do . For me added more depth in the sound the way i like it	1
I wanted to do subtle tweaks to my kindle fire for my earbud headphones . First , the bad . The interface should be zoomable or havea choice of sizes . As it is it 's an exercise in frustration trying to move the sliders with your pinkie in 1 or 2 dB increments and judgethe sound . The Bass Boost and Virtualizer knobs are even worse , I still do n't know exactly what physical movement/ / arc it want 's toget the knob to turn . Once it 's set ( mine was a 2dB cut at 3 kHz and a 3 dot Bass Boost ) it 's super easy to save in memory and name . The best part is the Virtualizer which does a credible job of increasing stereo separation . Even cranked to it 's extreme itproduces a believeable if exaggerated stereo spread , like you 're sitting front row center in a club with the musicians arrayed acrossthe stage . I would recommend saving your settings with the Virtualizer on and cranked up high , you can always shut it off whenit becomes intrusive like during newscasts and other mono sources . If they fix the interface size this will be a fantastic tool and I'llincrease it to 5 stars .	1
This EQ surprised me . I did n't think it would work on my kindle fire , but it does . The music I have sounds even better .	1
However while I liked it cause it did help with the sound , it did not really make it louder . I know maybe I 'm expecting too much of a tablet to sound like a stereo but hey maybe something better will come along or they will improve it .	1
This eq wirks with my fav radio ap - iheartradio ! Nice and easy , no fuss no muss.Definitely boosts the sound quality ! Samsung galaxy note 2 i317 android ver 4.1.2 ( unrooted )	1
This little app is a powerblock to enhance the listening features of my Kindle when using IHeart radio , etc . It is very straightforward in it 's use and setup .	1
EQ is easy . Basic . I use this app for all my music.. Well worth looking into , if your looking for improvement . This is the One	1
This really works , has a small footprint ( file size ) , makes it worth the buck for me . Who does n't want an EQ on their phone ?	1
I always love to have better sounds for my music and this app does just that . You can make your music sound like a remix or enjoy a studio quality sound . You can create custom settings for your music . Highly recommended .	1
This app is great I love the custom profile . This makes my device personality friendly . I can listen how I want too .	1
I 've installed this on two phones and a tablet , none of which have any kind of built-in equalization or tone controls for music . The app works the same on each device , but not all of them work really well with it.First off is an older model , a Samsung Galaxy S ( Showcase variant ) . The EQ works , but just barely . Lots of dropouts and blips in the music occur if I bring up the EQ and tinker with the settings , or try to use the EQ , a music app and do something else in the foreground . The phone 's not quite up to snuff to integrate the EQ seamlessly , which is not surprising since it ca n't play music on its own stock player without dropouts for the most basic of things , like checking mail or swiping through home screens.Second is a much newer and more powerful device , my Acer Iconia A700 10 & # 34 ; tablet . The EQ works better here , but despite its quad-core processor it still glitches and stutters with Music Volume EQ loaded in the background while other things are going on . If the tablet is left alone with just EQ + a music player , it seems to do fine . I have not tried to use it while playing HD video yet.Last but certainly not least is my personal everyday phone , an HTC Droid DNA . EQ works beautifully here , with no lag , hiccups , blips or dropouts when using any music or video player . I 've run the EQ with active Bluetooth , Google Music cloud player and Waze all running together with no issues & # 8212 ; a great thing for commuting ! I actually use it in conjunction with the phone 's built gimmicky Beats Audio enhancement to make it actually sound good instead of compromised.For me , the only thing that detracts a star are the hard to use and mostly useless & # 34 ; knobs & # 34 ; for bass and virtualizer . Oh and the lack of bands in the EQ . A good EQ to me should have at least 10 bands , ideally more . If you really want to impress me , make it like the one built into the Rockbox software that can be overlaid on old mp3 players & # 8212 ; multi-band EQ with totally customizable center points and Q settings . That would be awesome.But at least for casual users looking to eek out a little more oomph from their cheap earbuds ( or bad car stereos , in my case ) then the five selected bands are actually pretty good on their own .	1
This product makes it possible for me to enjoy my music even more wen I read or work . Easy to adjust to taste .	1
Got this as the free app of the day . It really works great on my Kindle Fire HD . Easy to use , has pre-sets and you can save your own adjustments . You can tweak the sound to your liking when using headphones , stand alone speaker or playing through the Kindle itself . Best free app in a long time .	1
I can only watch clips , because , i am supported by TWC , and to watch full episodes , you need to log into your account , right ? Seems legit . But when I went to log in , THEY DID N'T HAVE TWC ON THE LIST ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I am super dissapointed . WILL change review if updated to add twc .	1
it never has to load it just goes to a movie or a game with a blink of an eye and the best part is that I did n't even have to sign up it just recognized me and it works great on kindle fire HD 's ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Guess it 's like the HBO app - does n't give you free HBO ... just lets you access your HBO subscription on a mobile device . So I can watch live TV and selected episodes by logging in with my Xfinity/Comcast account . There 's a long list of providers so you can probably find whatever one you use . Just wish more episodes were available -- these look like the same available on On Demand .	1
You can watch clips but if you want long shows log in and if you think this is a bad app think again free full shows and clips this app it worth more than free its a great deal	1
My family has 3 TVs . My little brother , Mom and Dad all have one . I do n't . This app is perfect for that problem . I can catch up on the OLD CN shows ( Yay ! ) watch clips and even get on live feed . This is for young and old . For a 17 yr old girl this is great . I recommend it to anyone .	1
Really came in handy for my Husband when he had to take the kids with him to a job site and they were able to watch their favorite cartoons	1
I love cartoon network . Even though it is not as good as the pc version , ( cartoonnetwork.com ) it 's good . This does n't have ALL of the episodes , it only has a few or more I could be wrong , i have n't used it in a long time , it 's got all the shows though	1
I like it because kids can watch new episodes on tablet that they may have missed on TV . Its also has clips of older episodes .	1
This is the best app in the world since I do n't have cable for my Tv I Can just get this I recommend it to ANYONE	1
It 's a great app . You can watch episodes or live TV . All the negative reviews are because they do n't have the right TV provider .	1
very good app . fun stuff to watch and do with games as well . Safe fun app for kids to enjoy !	1
LOVE WATCHING CARTOONS BETTER THAN WATCHING THE NEWS ON YOUR TABLET WAY TOO SAD CARTOONS YOU LAUGH MORE AND MORE	1
Great app . I use it on a Kindle Fire and it never lags or has trouble displaying a video . I recommend it to everyone that loves watching all their favorite Cartoon Network shows on their mobile device .	1
It 's a great app . I can watch cartoon network anywhere I go on my kindle fire hd . But the live tv page runs slow when I login my tv provider . I hope they 'll fix it .	1
great to have every one should should get this and try it good to have one on your kindlreit is a great item	1
I like it because it allows me to watch my favorite cn shows and I hope they switch out the episodes every once in a while	1
Very easy to access using my provider credentials . I am able to watch full episodes of shows not typically shown as often , as well as others that are run repetitiously . It is neat to watch cartoons on my Fire .	1
I love to watch Cartoon Network , this is a great app to do the job . I recomned it to anyone who is bored or just loves Cartoon Network .	1
CN is one of my favorite channels period . Now I can watch anywhere and anytime , What ! ! ! If you like CN than get this app .	1
This is the best tv app ever . This app lets you watch Cartoon Network live or lets you watch the last 5 eppisodes of any show that Cartoon Network airs . My kids LOVE this app .	1
You can watch full episodes if u log in . Other wise you 'll have to watch clips . I think it 's truly awesome	1
I love CN ! I always wanted cartoon network on my Kindle Fire HD . Works great and looks better on a tablet ! There are episodes and clips . Like really guys , SOME shows have clips and episodes on both . TV shows like , Dude what would happen , has clips because there can be like many events of what would happen . The good news is , with clips , you can watch past episodes but with smaller time . Have fun with this .	1
I especially like how you can choose to start from any level you have completed . This is nice if you want to start at a more difficult pace instead of starting back at level 1 . You do n't rack up as many points as if you would go the long hall form level 1 every time , but it makes quick games more fun .	1
This is a pleasant experience . Relaxing but challenging . I 'm still learning but it 's not so difficult that you give up and delete the game	1
This is a great game . Graphics are good and the levels are just challenging enough . They get much much more difficult as you progress .	1
This is not Tetris . You are sliding blocks back and forth to fill rows . I found the game somewhat addicting , but the game gets old quick . You will want to start off in ZEN mode first to learn there is no time limits and pressure there .	1
It 's a lot of fun . Skill and watchfulness are required , more so than simple luck . You 'll have hours of fun .	1
Though this game claims to be like Tetris , I think it is only marginally similar . Instead of rotating and moving , you just slide pieces . It 's pretty challenging , you have to figure out the strategy for filling rows to avoid stacking.I used Zen mode and infinite mode , and they both worked well . One one-star review said the game did n't download properly , but it worked fine on my Fire HD . I liked the game . Four stars , at least . Maybe five stars , I need to play some more ... .	1
This is a fun game . In some ways , it 's similar to Tetris , but in this game you get to change pieces already in the board , not the ones dropping down . I picked this up today and have spent a surprising amount of time playing . It 's held my attention as a simple , fun break in the routine game .	1
I have n't played it much yet , but I really like it so far . Only time will tell if I start to love it .	1
Yes , it looks like tetris at first glance , but it really is different . Levels go on forever and become increasingly difficult . They are also repeatable for those of us that have interruptions . Great fun for hours .	1
This is the best game I 've played in ages . It wins in so many different ways.The gameplay is similar to Tetris with falling pieces that you need to nest to complete a line . You complete lines to avoid stacking up the table and losing . But instead of different shaped Tetris pieces , these are all lines of different widths . Sounds simple , but it isn't.The graphics are very visually appealing . They did a great job with the shapes , glass textures , and colors . Very well done.And most importantly , this game is solid and does n't crash . I get so fed up with my EA version of Tetris crashing all the time ( and trying to sell me extra level-ups ) .Great game .	1
For me it like the Tetris I always wanted to play . I can make a mistake and move the piece to correct it . HIGHLY recommended fr any one that loves a GREAT puzzle game .	1
I just love this game ! I wish I could play this game all the time . Very addictive . Wish they had more levels in the game . But other than that it 's just a good game .	1
I could not stop playing this once I started . It is a lot of fun but very addictive . I feel it is a must have .	1
I picked this up last week , and I 'm really enjoying the replay factor of the game . The game offers random achievements , which are a fun way to reward those that replay and build their skill.I play the Infinite mode where I restart my progress at level 1 after I run out of room and the game ends . The Zen mode is just a continual running , but I do n't find it challenging . The Survival mode is tough because you get a limited time to move blocks before bombarded with a bunch of falling blocks.I find the game challenging as you have to manage the fallen blocks , the upcoming blocks , and decide when to take advantage of the special blocks ( e.g. , bombs , glowing blocks , etc. ) . It 's taken me several hours to develop strategies and make progress on the levels .	1
This is a really fun game , and I played it for weeks and weeks . One day I had to reset my Kindle Fire and I lost all my progress , but it was fun to start over . Then one day it would n't play any more . I cleared it from my Kindle and then re-loaded it . The icon is still on my Kindle , but the game is gone . That 's my problem , though . I highly recommend this game !	1
I was initially skeptical of this game . The & # 34 ; -tris/-dris & # 34 ; suffix led me to believe that this would be another Tetris clone . In reality , although blocks do fall , and the goal is to clear lines , the primary game mechanic is to slide blocks back and forth in the playing field . There are several game modes , but excluding Survival Mode , blocks fall into the playing field after each of your moves . Thus , the game allows you to stop and consider each move , if you wish . I have enjoyed this game for several hours , so far , and I 'm looking forward to playing more of it .	1
The combination of the lights and sound were wonderful ! This is a game to test speed and acknowledge shapes and size . The whole family had fun taking turns and helping each other . Great for getting kids to work motor skills fitting shapes and size .	1
In playing this game , the similarities to tetris are obvious . The rods of various shapes falling from the top of the screen and the goal of creating a solid line of rods.After that , the similarity ends , but not necessarily for the worse . You ca n't rotate the rods , which can , at times , make the game more difficult , but you can slide rods around before they fall and once they have fallen . The rods fall so fast that there 's no way you could slide them as they fall.There are other twists , such as rods coming from the bottom , immovable rods , and rods that can eliminate all rods of the same color.Overall , I definitely recommend getting it ! If you do , start with Zen mode . It 's the perfect mode to master your art before you try Infinite and Survival .	1
I love to play tetris , and this game is similiar , except more face paced and harder ! The object of the game is to eliminate lines ( just like tetris ) but the twist is you can manipulate blocks left and right . It is a lot of fun !	1
This game is pretty fun - the levels that allow you to play continuously let you get a good feel for the game .	1
Wow ... played the first Dentist Office and this one is just as good if not better . Great graphics and sounds ! Loved it .	1
The kids & I loved the first game in the series and this one is even more fun to play & educational as well . Plus you have new characters to perform dental procedures on which is great ! Highly recommend !	1
I love this app . You can download almost any map you need on your tablet so you do not need to be online to search a map for directions or where a city is etc .	1
I like this app , does n't need a internet connection . I use it on my tablet and when we travel it comes in handy . Very nice app , delivers everything as promised .	1
This is a cute game . We like Hello Kitty . We like that we can create our own garden in this free version and that no real money is required and that patience is learned by playing this game .	1
This is a nice game , if it will not close on you , my autistic child loves the little animals as they do their work , I do recommend this game , if you can get it to stay open . Thank you . Mrs. Lopez	1
Its pretty much like any other farming game , u grow crops u get $ for them but the music & hello Kitty characters make it so cute & # 60 ; 3	1
I love Hello Kitty however this game makes her seem even cuter ! which is why I gave this game 5stars	1
My great grandson loves my kindle fire , so have downloaded a few games for him . He is just four and loves anything to do with fire engines .	1
App is very cute ... wish it had more features but decent fpr a free game ... would think about buying the paid app gon na try it out for a few days amd see if baby is imterested	1
Loved it ! I like puzzles and crime solving games and this had both & # 62 ; I just wish there were more cases .	1
I love this game , it keeps the mind sharp and helps with hand-eye coordination . i have introduced this to older ladies and they love it	1
I like it but needs mini map and new controls that 's all all all I think for now . ok oko ok	1
This is one of those overhead racing games where it takes some getting used to the steering as your car changes direction from up , right , down , left and up again . There is also a lot of drift just like on those old arcade racing games I never quite got a hang of , but now not having to feed that machine dozens of quarters I will master this game.I put this one on my phone because some were complaining about graphics on their tablets . Works great on my HTC One . Looks great too .	1
However , I only downloaded this game because it was FREE at the time I was downloading this and I do not know if it is still free after I submit this review .	1
I find bear hug media Inc has the most awesome games I have seen so far . I love makeover games . and now that their on kindle Fire I 've gone wild I 've been asking my parents day after day if I can have this free game . and I 'm a game addict so I love themLOVE jim p.s . I 'm a girl not a boy ; )	1
really cool game I love it all modles are unlocked and its really fun . I recommend it to every girl . I love it its so much fun you should get this game	1
I love this game cause you can do hair and when I grow up I 'm going to be a hair salon girl.Everybody has to like the game at least because if you do n't then WHY DID YOU GET THE GAME !	1
This app is very cool . You can choose from two avatars and do their hair tons of different ways . When I am shaving the person 's hair it makes me feel like they have cancer . It makes me feel that I should be grateful that I am healthy and alive .	1
This game kept my grandson 's attention . We shared the fun of changing the looks of the girls . However , it would have been fun if the looks of boys were available . In today 's times the boys are also aware of what they can achieve with changes to their features .	1
My 4 year old and 8 year old granddaughters love these little games . I 'm glad they can download them . It keeps them occupied when they 're bored .	1
This game is great for young kids , ads very rarely pop up and it does n't have a lot of things locked .	1
I love this game and u should definitely try it and also try the other games from this maker like : crazy dentist crazy doctor kids spa and many many more hope u like them : )	1
Hair salon was an awesome choice . My kid gets a kick out of cutting , coloring and styling hair . You 're initially given 2 characters . It 's worth purchasing the extras . They are n't pricey at all . The other head accessories like head bands , flowers and glasses only add to it 's appeal .	1
I gave this product this rating because it has a lot of different designs . You could die the hair , cut it , and style it	1
Now if u look at the other reviews u well see that it seems as a pretty good game if u want to be someone who cuts hair then this is a awesome great good game so please please please please get this game sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo heart great ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
This is an app that I would recommend for all ages . This is fun but limited to who you can use .	1
why does every app I buy have the best characters locked ? am I right ? other than that it 's a good game	1
It is a really fun game but it is a little bit hard . You can cut it change the color . You can shave and gule the hair back on .	1
Toca hair salon did not work on my kf so I saw this and I was very happy ! ! I would n't be happier with any other app ! ! ! This is a very good app were you can comb the hair ( sometimes is hard to use ) blow the hair ( which can be crazy sometimes ) cut , shave , grow , and color the hair . When I said the kind of negative things before I ment it as it is not a serious app . It is definitely an app for kids . I would suggest ages 6-10 . I almost forgot to mention that you can put on sun glasses and hats ! I hope this review was helpful . Btw the ages I suggested were just suggestions .	1
I love this app it 's really fun and you can comb there hair choose a hair Color . you should get this app .	1
omg most of the hair salon apps cost money so that 's why I got it . also I love 6677g Ltd apps I have all of them and I 'm glad that they are still making more apps ! they are awesome ! so get this game it might be the only free hair salon app !	1
ive always tried to find a free Toca boca type game . Finally ive found a pretty licit one . - kaelah	1
My 2 year old grand daughter loves this game . She will play and stay quiet for the longest time with this ... ..	1
this app is fun but there are only two people u can style and it cost 10 $ to unlock everything but overall fun !	1
My son loves this !	1
She says it 's the best hair salon ever . She can cut , comb , and style the hair . You can pick the person to use , color of hair , etc .	1
This app is fun but there are only two people to work on so it is a decent and fun app but it needs more people	1
This game is for my great granddaughter , ( 10 ) , she loves it and stays with it for quite a while . Glad to have it in the carousel .	1
I do n't care for it . It is boring all u get to do is make hair . If u like it I still do n't care for it ok maybe it is ok	1
This is a fun creative game for little girls . They can blow dry , cut , and style different types of hair . The only thing I do n't like is the constant background snipping noise . I did n't see a setting to turn it off . Even turning the volume down did n't turn down the snipping sound .	1
It 's a cute game FOR MY 5 YR OLD DAUGHTER ! ! Ok , here 's an epiphany ... .games that my child enjoys perhaps , maybe , I think possibly may NOT be a challenging app for me ( an adult ) as well.And here 's the crazy part ... as I reviewed this app to decide to download this FAOTD I happened to read that some stuff COSTS ACTUAL MONEY . Now perhaps the description on my Kindle Fire may be different than others ... .but I doubt it.GREAT GAME FOR MY LITTLE ONE !	1
I love this game its one of the best games ever ! ! ! ! ! ! ! if I were u I would totally get this app and the best part is that its free	1
This game is fun to play because it 's just something ME or my friends could play I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ITS SO FUN ! ! ! !	1
I got this on for my granddaughters when they come over they love hair make up and nail apps and this one is different . They get to wash cut , curl , crimp , and straighten the hair .	1
Put on for my 6 yr old granddaughter . She says she really likes it . It 's easy to play and fun	1
I think that it is lame.I think this because all you do is do hair like coam her or his hair.It is good do good for little kids because they can learn how to take care of there hair .	1
This game is the best hair salon game i have tried , the only bad thing is their are only 2 people to style , the other 2 you have to pay to unlock .	1
My 5 and 6 year old granddaughters love playing this game ... .They love showing me their cuts ... . One wants to now be a beautician ...	1
It 's a really nice game even though it takes money to upgrade you do n't HAVE TO and its time taking ( which is good ) : )	1
All good for the kids and adults to . They are all having a ball eith this games and keeping busy when bored	1
I got this for my 4 year old granddaughter , who wants my full attention 24-7 . She was so pleased with this that she quit trying to style my hair , and worked on this instead .	1
liked the game enjoy a female investigator , wanted more game time , would recommend to others , thinking about getting full game .	1
This app installed and opened perfectly the first time . You can start and stop at any point and pick-up right where you left off . The narration is soothing and the music heavenly .	1
I love this application . I have prayed the prayers and I love the music and I love the ease of using this , thanks .	1
This is an impressive game . It looks good and runs very well . The controls could use a little work but this is a great game .	1
I just stared playing this game but so far I like it . Love trying to find hidden objects and this game is a real challenge	1
As hidden object games go , `` Castle Wonders '' is one of the better ones , and perhaps a bit easier than many , at least in the Classic casual mode , which I prefer , since there 's no timer . The Memory Mode and Survival Mode are locked at the beginning and ca n't be played until you 've beaten one of the earlier modes.The graphics are very good , beginning with a view of the castle as you approach it , then entering the castle and exploring the various rooms and gardens within the castle . The hidden objects are mostly fairly easy to find in the simpler modes , which makes the game a good one for novices and kids . Most hidden objects fit in with the medieval setting , but there are a few anachronistic objects such as hand grenades and pizza . As your game improves , you can move up to the tougher modes . There are so many combinations of play modes , difficulty levels , and object match types that the game has a lot of replay value as your skills increase and you 're looking for a greater challenge .	1
The level of detail is amazing . And this one has a lot more game modes than other hidden object games I 've seen !	1
I like the way you win your way to the other levels and I hope you will have other levels coming very soon . The different rooms and the objects to find are wonderful ! I love the fact that if I ca n't find an object the hint help me without penalizing me . Thank you for that . I look forward to many more of you hidden object games . Hurry !	1
Ablab one is really easy to use on any mobile device such as an android telephone . nice big buttons and easy to read display make using this thing very easy with your thumb and I love that the parentheses are very easy to access right there on the main screen . Accurate too ... 2 plus 3 times four is correctly 14 unlike some of the other calculatorsand it also has a clearable history . for me and my day to day office mathematics this one is perfect . Thanks	1
The is the 4th calculator we 've seen in recent weeks as the free app of the day , and ranks 3rd out of the 4 in their appeal to me . It has the least functionality of the four , but also the lowest regular price , at a buck.While the other calculators had hosts of scientific and business functions , this one adds mostly trig functions . What I find clunky is that the trig functions are hidden under an ADV ( advanced ) button so that the numbers and trig functions do n't appear at the same time , causing you to have to toggle back and forth.There are two nice features of the calculator that salvaged four stars from me ( otherwise I was about to give three ) :1. you can enter your entire calculation in one string and then hit equal2 . it has parentheses so that you can correctly mix addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division ( and other included formula functions ) into your calculation in your needed priority.You get an exponent function in with the trig , but not a simple square function , so for example to do 8 squared you must enter 8 on the number screen , then tap ADV , then tap ^ , then when it returns to the number pad tap 2 , then `` = '' . Again , kind of clumsy compared to most calculators which would give you both a square function and an exponent function . The same process is needed for roots.The buttons are HUGE on a tablet device . So while I 'm sure this is more convenient on a smart phone , on any tablet there is just a lot of wasted space that could have been used more efficiently to keep you from having to swap screens for anything but simple math.My four stars might be too high but I 'm going to leave it at that , since the app is inexpensive , does do the job , and does n't have a long list of intrusive permissions.I used this on a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had no problems with it.While I think the focus on trig functions is a bit unusual , I 'd recommend this app if those functions , plus basic math , happen to fit your needs .	1
Works great does the job easy to operate and easy to read the numbers.if you are looking for a easy to operate and read this is it	1
This one has the distinction of being much simpler and easier to use than some of the others . It 's good for when you just need a basic , reliable , um , calculator . I too will not be using my forehead to do the math , but I sure would like to watch Tinfoot do it . The larger than usual buttons will be nice for my fingers , swollen by Rheumatoid arthritis . The 4 stars are because there 's a possibility of hidden activity from Google not mentioned in the permissions . How tacky . The layout looks good on my Kindle HDX , and I have no problems with it . Thank you Tinfoot for your most enjoyable review !	1
This is a basic calculator with the usual add , subtract , multiply , and divide ; if you tap the & # 8220 ; ADV & # 8221 ; icon you will also have some higher-level functions such as sine , cosine , tangent , pi , and square root . While there are lots of other calculator apps that have the same functionality , what sets this one apart from others I have tried is the number / function icons are HUGE and really help out with avoiding some of the touch-type mistakes I always seem to make on a keyboard.About the only negative I can think of is the app permissions want to have access to the network & # 8211 ; that doesn & # 8217 ; t make sense as you don & # 8217 ; t need a network to do basic math . Interestingly , the app ran fine with all of my network settings turned off on my 8.9 & # 8221 ; Fire.I picked this up for free as a free app of the day vs. its normal price of 99 cents . If you & # 8217 ; re looking for a basic calculator for your Fire ( or other device ) that has large number / function icons , I would recommend this one .	1
This is a more than adequate calculator for anyone unless they higher math or science needs . For anyone who has impaired vision . Dependent on the degree of impairment , it could be perfect or less than perfect .	1
Who does not need a calculator from time to time this one is special big easy to work with dials.Nothing but likes here.I would recommend this to anyone .	1
You got ta get the game it 's just awesome . The graphics are amazing and its fair cause you can get items for free I got a uniform and gloves . So GET THIS GAME ! ! !	1
The game is a lot of fun . I just wish that you could use real MLB players on MLB teams or maybe retired and hall of fame players .	1
I love this game it passes time an do n't drag on you do n't get very bored if you play for hours at a time an my little girl loves it	1
Easy to learn yet complicated enough to master to keep you coming back for a long time . A great home run derby game . Impressive graphics and fun head to head battles .	1
Just a fun game . Two pitchers throw some off-speed , curves , heaters and whatever else they can to keep you from going yard . Challenging and enjoyable .	1
I think this is a great game I basically only play this game . It is totally a game I would recommend to anyone	1
This HOMERUN game from ESPN is right on point . It has everything you love about hit HOMERUN ' s and the controls are amazingly perfect . Hours and hours of FUN ! I am a mom of 4 , and I love to play this game as much as the kids do .	1
Great game , fat pitching with different pitches . I like the fat pace the game brings . I would say yes to all my friends	1
awesome game i love playing this game its a great game for hand and eye cordination to help people there	1
This game is great if you like lots of action this game has it . I do n't like a lot of games but this is a game I highly recommend	1
Going Going Gone is a & # 34 ; home run derby & # 34 ; setting . The game is interesting as the format changes but it does become repetitious .	1
My son love the `` where 's my water '' and `` where 's my Perry '' games , so I took the chance and ordered this one . Like the original and first sequel , the goal is to get water to the output pipe . In this case , the output pipe goes to a water fountain where Mickey waits to make lemonade . The puzzles are similar to the ones on the other two games , with the added element of mickey standing in the background waiting for his water.Now , for the warning side of things . There are two things you should be aware of as a parent . This game does use a little more crude humor than the other two . The whole premise of the game is that Mickey is trying to make lemonade to sell to hungry customers , and much of the humor reminds me of older Mickey cartoons . These are not horrible , just things like a lemon `` peeing '' into the water.The second thing is that you only get the Mickey maps , the full Goofy ones are not included ( and must be purchased separately ) . This can mean some complaining ensues at that point - and requests for the additional maps ( only the first couple are included as a teaser ) . I will give my opinion of the Goofy maps since it does n't appear that you can actual search for them separately.The Goofy maps cost $ 1.99 and are significantly cruder than the Mickey ones . In Ship Wrecked , Goofy is trying to change the random things he finds on the island into food . If you fail to get the food converting material to him , he does things like eat his hand . So this is not for young children.The second set of Goofy maps Goofy is trying to paint a picture . Similar types of things happen while he is trying to paint , though mostly around his frustration if he does n't get his magic paint . The pictures he does make if you get the `` paint '' to him are kinda cool older Disney drawings .	1
It 's a fun game , all the `` where 's my '' games are very fun ! : - ) my kids and I love it . highly recommend it .	1
My four year old daughter is in complete and utter love with all things Mickey , so this game was a no-brainer to purchase . She played the first few levels pretty easily ; but as expected , she 's still a bit too young for it . That does n't mean that I have n't enjoyed it . If you liked & # 34 ; Where 's my water ? & # 34 ; You 'll enjoy the changes to the game . The level clear screen with Mickey and the lemons is fun too .	1
This game can is entertaining for hours ! I love Disney and especially Mickey , so this was awesome to find . Yay !	1
there are 4 mickey episodes and 2 goofy episodes . and 3 secret levels and 10 item levels all together 133 levels . an amassing amount of stuff for the price of 1.99 and another 99 cents for goofy levels . I only hope thay add Donald Minnie daisy and my faveret Oswald levels ( Oswald the lucky rabbit was one of the first Disney characters . he was made in 1926and in 1927 that lost the rights to him until 2006 that why that had to make mickey mouse in 1928 )	1
This is a great app , it 's another spin off of where my Water but with Mickey , it 's got great graphics and a cute story video .	1
My daughter loves this game she plays it over and over . It was worth the money , I would purchase another version .	1
The little cartoons before each level are so cute and the levels are fun to do . So far , I 've only done a few levels of the Mickey levels but I will continue to play this game . Disney had a great idea to expand the Where 's My Water family to Mickey .	1
I bought Mickey for my Kindle Fire HD . I have n't noticed any quirks . The kids , 5 & 6 , love it and it is addicting as is Where 's my Water & where is Perry . We love when Mickey says & # 34 ; Oh boy ! & # 34 ; whenever his basket is full . It 's Mickey what 's not to love !	1
When I purchased this app I was very happy . It was a lot of fun and a great challenge . I highly recommend this app to all ages	1
If your kids love Mickey Mouse , and want a challenge this is it . it is a good game for kids of all ages	1
This is a super cute game . Just as fun and challenging as Perry and Water . Love the different things Mickey does between levels .	1
BEST GAME EVER ! ! ! ! I can of get enough of it . I NEED more levels ! Great puzzles and bonus levels to boot . If you like old fashion type Mickey cartoons and puzzles you will love this game	1
My 5 Year Old Loves This Game ! I 'm So Glad I Bought it . It Became One Of His Favorites Instantly .	1
keeps me busy during the lax times . I love it and play many more other games . keeps my mind active	1
This game is so much fun . It 's a story about Mickey trying to make lemonade but he does n't have enough water.So see if you can pass the levels so he could make lemonade .	1
where 's my mickey is cool because they get the right personality for mickey . and I love how cute pluto is .	1
You should get this app . One of the best disney apps so far ! I LOVE IT ! My sis is already almost done that means she likes it ! ! ! ! ! ! ; )	1
My 7 yr old thinks this is pretty fun , as long as you like finding solutions to problems . You have to look at the level page and determine which order to move the water around in to clear the level .	1
Yay ! Finally made for the 1st generation ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Yay to you Amazon ! ! Now please make all games that way , it ca n't be that hard .	1
My grandson age 3 loves it he figured it out faster then I did . It has kept him occupied for hours	1
My daughter plays this app all the time . She absolutely loves Mickey . Sometimes she makes me dress up as mickey for Halloween . She told me that this is her favorite app ever . She has a lot of fun finding mickey and I believe it is helping her brain exercise . Great game , I recommend this .	1
Still have this game on my kindle , no issues with it skipping or anything . Would recommend for a kid between 5-8 years old .	1
This game was fantastic ! But it was over too soon . We got the new levels and ca n't wait to get more ! Thank you Disney !	1
This is a fun game , the cartoons are cute . I would recommend this for anyone who likes other games like this .	1
I have no idea why I 'm a sucker for these types of games but I completely love this game ! ! ! ! It 's a great time killer not to mention the silly cartoons and awesome graphics . Awe I just adore it ! ! ! !	1
If you like puzzles that exercise your brain , this is a great game . The higher levels are quite intricate . Enjoy !	1
I enjoy using this app it functions well , it runs smoothly , and it works with three video sharing websites . P.S . ( if the video messes up and pauses delete the cache and download it again ) .	1
Tried others and this is the best one I tried . Allows me to log into my account . Does n't block the screen with messages like logging into the website plus I can record .	1
Just love these 'Live Jigsaw ' puzzles . Currently have all the 'live ' puzzles available . Really like the finished graphics . Have chosen to complete all puzzles in the difficult mode . The music track accompanying the puzzles is most relaxing . Upon placing the last piece in a puzzle , the outlines of the pieces fade away , revealing a beautiful illustration . Some puzzles offer very subtle 'live ' illusions , while others are bolder , yet not overwhelming . Looking forward to plenty more of these 'live ' puzzles .	1
I enjoy the puzzles from Difference Games . They are beautiful , imaginative illustrations and just difficult enough to keep you entertained . The interaction with the pieces is very good . I recommend them to any jigsaw puzzle fan .	1
Seems to work like they said . It was n't difficult to use . I probably would buy again if I needed To	1
Before installing this memory cleaner I would get notifications of 90 % memory exhausted . Game playing takes up a ton of memory . These little tablets do n't have memory to spare . Before I start a game I use this cleaner and shut off everything in the background that I am not going to be using . My games play better and I am not getting notifications any longer . There are also no & # 34 ; porn fairies & # 34 ; advertised on this cleaner like some of the free ones . Safe for kids .	1
It is a cool game . If you like building games you should get this for sure . Best game in the world yeah .	1
love the game . playing on kindle now because the last update rendered my phone app dead . SG4 . hope they get it fixed as I have 40 plus on most aliens . starting all over on my KF but the game is sluggish . still playing though.. hooked on it..	1
This game is like bejeweled but has many more layers of depth to gameplay . Easy to learn but epic to master . This game has had me hooked for 2 weeks now and I do n't plan on stopping any time soon .	1
Right now this is my favorite game . I liked the free version so much I wound up purchasing the add free version with perks . I may take a break from this game but I always wind up coming back to it again and again . It is a challenge but not impossible . The version that gives you extra moves definitely helps .	1
This game is different from the usual match three games by the sliding and match structure . Once I figured out what to do it was fun .	1
It 's so good and actually.makes you think on what your next step should be . plus the aliens are kinda cute , and it 's really addictive	1
I love how it looks and I can spend hours playing Alien Hive . I just find it a little hard to progress , but that might just be my lazy brain .	1
This game is fun and challenging at the same time . Nice graphics and cute aliens . I can see I will be spending a lot of time trying to master . I would like to see clearer instructions on all aspects of the game .	1
I GOT THIS GAME LAST WEEK AND IT IS REALLY FUN TO PLAY AND LOTS OF THINGS TO ELVOLVE IN TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AFTER JUST A FEW MOVES .	1
This game is a very different kind of puzzler a new take on it . I am enjoying the challenge a great deal so far . Great look to it as well .	1
Do you enjoy candy crush or bejeweled , then you 'll love this it 's slightly more challenging but just as addictive . You really have to use your brain to plan and balance your alien and plant evolutions . I 'm hooked .	1
I am not much of a game player when using my phone or Kindle , but I tried this game out and I do like it . Good game , can not complain .	1
I started this game thinking it was your average match 3 game , and quickly realized Alien Hive is an actual puzzle , with the match 3 element thrown in . I love this game , and plan on downloading the other games by this developer , too .	1
This game has quickly become one of my favorites . With a surprising depth of strategic planning , and a wide variety of aliens to collect ( 24 in all , randomly awarded ) , there is a huge replay value . Best of all , there are no time constraints , so you are free to contemplate and make careful choices.The game controls are smooth and fluid , with no problems on my Kindle Fire HD7 . I had an issue which was my fault , not the game 's , where pieces were n't sliding correctly ( taking only part of what I had selected ) , and ultimately the game crashed . After the second time I realized I had too many other things running and not enough resources to support the game . With that in mind , I have n't encountered any further issues.The game mechanics are simple : match any 3 objects ( not only linear matches , also 2+1 , it took me a while to figure that out ) which will evolve into the next higher forms of themselves . There are plant forms which ultimately evolve to become & quot ; magic , & quot ; and alien forms which will become a & quot ; supreme & quot ; alien , giving permanent rewards.Each game begins with 100 energy crystals . Each move , or use of power-ups , costs one crystal , while matching plant forms and crystals replenish the energy . Prior to the game you have the option to purchase 50 additional energy for 4000 gold ( as well as other boosts at various prices ) , and following the game you have the option to purchase 50 additional energy for 5000 gold and continue.Gold is earned through gameplay , and there is also a blitz mode ( 60 seconds of slightly altered play ) which , I was pleased to find , rewards gold that counts in the hive mode , giving a quick means of earning additional gold when necessary.There are three permanent upgrades , which can be purchased for $ 1.99 each : double starting energy , +50 % gold earnings/purchase , and an upgrade to a game feature . Any of these purchases will also remove in-game ads . The ads are generally unobtrusive , and I 've seen no questionable content that would be kid-inappropriate , however , there have been occasional between-game video ads which I found jarring and annoying.I ended up purchasing the additional energy . I 'd pay $ 1.99 for a good game , which this surely is , so why not support the devs . Besides , it got rid of the ads , and doubled my play time , so I 'm happy all around.My supreme alien strategy : magic plants are the key , collect plenty before wasting other resources trying to do the impossible . I purchased both the pre- and post-game energy , as well as a wormhole boost for another 3000 gold ( not sure that 's a must , but it did n't hurt ) .Magic plants act as a wildcard , and will evolve ( match ) any two adjacent pieces . I used these to match pre-cocoon aliens , cocoons , and small aliens , so , with 7 magic plants I evolved a supreme alien with moves to spare . One could use more plants to evolve even the earlier versions if playing with original energy values , without the $ $ purchase -- after playing a while you 'll get a feel for how many plants you might need.Enjoy ! : O )	1
Sorry , I have n't tried this yet , but when I do , I will let you know how it works for me .	1
definitely something to keep you busy when you are bored . the ads are a bit annoying but forgivable . I recommend this to you all for sure .	1
hints would be very helpful.but the game is fun . some songs sound very different on the piano . 4 star rating is just right for this app .	1
So much fun , super entertaining , I do n't know why I waited so long to finally get it . I 've seen my friends playing it and thought it looked ok , but now I know what the fuss was all about ! Definitely give it a try , you 're going to like it ! It 's great !	1
I like it . it could be better ... level 2 btw is Gotye . it took me forever to get that one ...	1
This app is ok I guess , but the songs are played in piano , so they don'tSound anything like the original songs .	1
So far so good . Songs are popular ones so it is a bit easy unless you do n't know the artists . The piano makes it a bit harder to catch at first but overall , I 'm . having fun with it .	1
This game is awesome for all the music lovers out there ! Lots of popular songs that mostly everyone will be familiar with . You wo n't regret downloading this game .	1
Fairly challenging throughout . More than a few gimmes , but the tough ones will have you scratching your head . Will recommend	1
this game is awesome but I Have . to delete it and install it a lot and I am stuck on 15 so if you know it that would be very helpfull but besides that this game rocks ! ! ! ! ! !	1
awesome app . cant get enough of it . I love the songs that are on the app . I been playing on it non stop .	1
Im stuck on level nine and I need help and also the answer to level eight is Linkin Park for those who need it .	1
Does anyone know the answer to level 5 ? I just started playing this game and am already stuck . It is fun though but I do n't know most of the songs off the top of my head .	1
This app is a very fun game ... you can play solo or with the kids or if you have game night ... you have to be up to date with the current music but for the most part the songs are songs you can hear on your local New music radio ... everything from rihanna to beyonce..I really enjoy playing and the BEST part is it 's a free app ! !	1
This is a great app . Everyone should play it . It consists of songs that people know and you guess the artist or the song .	1
Love it . It 's making me crazy but love it . Good mix of music and artists . Playing as a family so murder already	1
this game is very fun and challenging . I love to play it all the time.it is very very awesome.I love it ! ! ! ! !	1
This app is pretty challenging . I 've noticed that not all the levels are the same for each person especially regarding levels eight through ten . If you 're having trouble with these particular ones then try Mockingbird , Danza-something ( you can find the full name in the other reviews ) , Linkin Park , and Abba . I 'm sure you can figure out which words go in which level . It sucks that you ca n't just pick a certain genre to play since not everyone knows all the songs . A skip feature would also help tons and make the game more enjoyable .	1
I thought this was going to be a breeze for me..I really like it but I am definitely not as smart on songs as I thought I was..it 's fun to see who can guess the song etc first..	1
It 's a good game , but I do n't know some of the songs , so I 'm left trying to unscramble letters and make random words .	1
I love this app but I 'm stuck on level 4 but I just got it 2 days ago lobe the app can anybody tell me the answer for 4 though get guys you will love it see yu bye	1
It so so FUN Iove it and it 's so great and enjoyable I could play it forever and ever it 's awesome	1
cant seem to find an answer but i like this game . was also stuck on lvl 16 before reinstalling but okay .	1
It is really fun ! The levels are very challenging and it will keep you entertained . The only thing that 's wrong is that it wo n't let you post your songs to Facebook for help even though it gives the option .	1
This app is awesome and I love this app so much . I love playing this game all the time . Fun	1
I love this app . its fun and entertaining . it barely has any ads and I love the songs it makes me guess ( :	1
it has modern songs that everyone knows . its challenging yet fun ! Great game its just hard to move on when stuck	1
its a fun app if you like music but I 'm a bit mad that after the update I had to restart from the beggining .	1
A Fun game that includes amazing hits from the past few years . This game is fun and challenging at the same time . Everyone SHOULD Have this game .	1
this app was amazkng . it makes you want to keep playing . it has a great taste in music . i really love it .	1
I love quiz games and I thought this one was unique because its all piano music I love it so much ! ! ! - happy 11 year old	1
Best app ever I highly recommend this app to anyone who loves music . I play it all the time even tho some levels are hard	1
Very challenging game . Really made you listen and think . Some were harder than others . Could use to be a little less complex . We played as a family .	1
This app is really fun , but at the same time really challenging . You hear the tune and it 's on the tip of your tongue , but you ca n't get it . Great app .	1
Did n't know what to expect but this app surprised me with not only being up to date with its songs but it 's simplicity and fun factor .	1
a little challenging but really fun . wish you got more coins at the beginning . all in all a really fun game .	1
It 's really great you get lots of recent songs and there 's no bugs or freezes on Kindle Fire and they tell you to write the song or the artist but there 's Times when there comes a song that you do n't know and you basically spend lots of your money trying to figure out the song but beside that this app is GREAT I recommend it to all the kindle Fire HD people lol	1
Cool hearing the piano playing songs of today . This app is hard but fun . I love testing my abilities . There is also n way to cheat . Lol	1
The song choices keep you on your toes . Great way to pass the time or play with company as an ice breaker .	1
really fun game but also kind of challenging . Makes you think ! ! some are harder than others but all in all really fun	1
Tried to run this on my Kindle Fire ; kept giving me message that I needed an updated flash player . When I tried to download , there were several selections , but none seemed to match my Kindle Fire settings and the ones I tried to download , did n't make Rhapsody work either . There seemed to be two ways to access Rhapsody ; one took me to all this problem of the download and the other was the pay for it monthly option . I deleted all the downloads & Rhapsody app off my Kindle .	-1
why would you want to get a free app and but then have to pay 10 bucks a month to use it ?	-1
I just wanted a music player for what I already own . This charges you to listen to music that is provided . Dev needs to be more clear about this .	-1
This app was actually very stupid and very boring . Unless I missed something , its nothing but a blank screen with one verse written down . You ca n't really do to much more then read the one small passage . I deleted it after about a week .	-1
Can only play about 5 minutes and then forces closed . It 's a fun game , just frustrating that in the middle of a round , forces close . Please update and fix . Motorola Defy Android 2.2	-1
I just tried this game and the towers need to recharge but I have no idea how to do that I literary tried everybutton then I even went to help and all it all it said was they will need to be recharged so I folly do n't reccomend this .	-1
Never been speechless , but this is how this game leaves me unfortunately . Maybe by version 10 it will get better ? I hope so .	-1
It sucks ! ! The weapons are stuped.Don , t wast your time and your money.Who came up with this game is stuped . Get a life .	-1
Ended up removing this game from my phone . It was n't fun and I could n't figure out how to make the `` cannon '' fire more than once at a target . At least it was free .	-1
Those of you who like tower defense games are likely to enjoy games where creeps get progressively stronger , and towers that are adaptable , upgradeable and offer a variety of armaments . This app does n't offer much - it is a clunky game that lacks finesse , especially in level and unit design.The most frustrating part is that the towers are slow . They fire a single shot , and then take forever to reload . And thats plenty of time for a herd of bubbles to go whizzing by . Not much of a defense . It takes a while to figure out that you need to build and upgrade power stations to recharge your towers so they can fire more than once . The instructions are n't too helpful , either . The touchscreen is also laggy at times , which adds to the frustration.It might be easier to just include a button that lets you wave a white flag and surrender , rather than wait patiently for inevitable annihilation.There are many better TD games out there . This one is mediocre , at best .	-1
My team was on the bubble . Then Joe Lunardi popped it . Thanks a lot Joe for that . NIT here we come .	-1
this is not a good game . do not by it . I mean , really . its terrible . PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I gave this game a chance and boy was I wrong it 's so stupid . I ca n't believe I wasted some of my 32gb on this game	-1
This is terrible ! Poor graphics and concept is out there , but really better graphica would make it allot better . Perhaps a free app to begin with or if they need money that bad 50 & cent ; . Give me a go theme , calculator , tricorder , script or something .	-1
definitely not worth it , a great waste of time honestly , I was like wtf when I tried it out , and uninstalled immediately	-1
robot defense but less responsive and harder to understand even the easy setting . I hope they fix the bugs , but until they do I can not recommend this game at all !	-1
THE STUPID GUNS FIRE ONE TIME NOT A GOOD GAME DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY . GRRRRR GRRRRRRR GRRRRRR DONT BUY DONT BUY GUNS FIRE ONE TIME GRRRRR . D : & lt ;	-1
I bought this game . I regret that I bought it . do not get it . because it is not good for your gaming device . the game is.so blurry	-1
Waste of a free game on Amazon 's end . Gameplay is garbage , clunky , and did n't make compared to other defense games . Hard to imagine the frustration from those who actually paid for the app . Do n't waste your time even with the free app that Amazon offers , I wasted 20 mins of my life figuring this one out and I can never have that time back .	-1
just like the title says ... its like some 14 year old kids first attempt at an app . there is that and the fact that it is a total rip off of bloons which is totally worth buying	-1
For everyone saying the towers only fire once , you need to learn how the game works . One of the first things the game tells you is that you need a power station . That is a poor concept , and without the power station your towers only fire once . The power station & quot ; recharges & quot ; your towers , but ca n't handle a lot of them unless you upgrade the station . I gave it a one star for no sound , poor instructions , no real options menu , the use of a & quot ; power station & quot ; that costs a much as a basic tower and is required , and really for just being a bad game.To the devs , if you are going to force the player to use a power station for the towers either lower the cost or raise the amount of gold players start with .	-1
this is the first time I give an app a one star rating , and the first time I can actually say it 's not even worth the free download . unbelievable ! The worst & quot ; game & quot ; I 've ever come across !	-1
This app accesses your phone number , like Skype or Google Voice . Verified with Privacy Blocker . 1 star for privacy invasion and lack of disclosure .	-1
I & apos ; m offended by the fact that they would try to charge people $ 4 normally for something that isn & apos ; t as good as many free apps . Does it work ? Sure , but , for example , Carrr Matey is a much more enjoyable app and it & apos ; s always free .	-1
I had high hopes for this application , but it is hard to use and doesn & apos ; t quite work right . Holding it the way it described made it very hard to see the screen due to glare of the sun . Also , the radar doesn & apos ; t work right ; it doesn & apos ; t face the right direction ( it thought I was facing North when I was really facing West ) . All in all , I am not going to rely on it .	-1
I have tried to use this app several times and it has not once successfully located my car . Totally worthless . The last time it said my car was 42km away when I was standing next to it .	-1
there is absolute no reason for this application fee or not ... not on my phone . Hey dev ... I think you need to think about	-1
Too many unnecessary permissions are needed for this App . There is no reason they need your personal data to manage your locations .	-1
This app only works with friends if they have it too . With that said , Google Latitude is better because Latitude is free ( & amp ; more people have Google accounts ) .	-1
I did not install as well . way too many permissions for something I can do on google maps . Dev . thanks for the app but I won & apos ; t install until you explain the permissions .	-1
the sensitivity adjustments on this game Suck . Does n't make much sense to get stuck behind a rock wall . And to put and have the ball bounce off the pin , over and over again Sucks . This AP is a rip off .	-1
I love how this app shows me the guide for cable since my new provider does n't offer a channel guide.The only problem is the in app ads . They are huge and take up half of the screen . I tried to find a way to pay to eliminate the ads but there is no way.I am very disappointed . I think I 'll look for another channel guide app .	-1
used to use this a lot but for some reason cant locate my zipcode ! ! ! I uninstalled & amp ; reinstalled it -- - hmmm cant locate Los Angeles CA	-1
I spent a lot of time entering my channels by filtering them only to have it do an update and lose all my preferences . I 'll be removing it from my Kindle HDX . Thanks anyway .	-1
This app does n't have my cable provider ... & gt ; 8 [ TV Guide app does . I need more words before I can submit my review . Geesh , I still need more ...	-1
It is to & # 34 ; linear & # 34 ; ... i.e . guide is not layed out in a grid format . I prefer to use the online grid supplied by DISH Network . where I can see several hours and about 10 channels on the same screen grid . I removed it from my Kindle Fire .	-1
This is a very good app . Yes it is ad-supported , but the app is well worth using even with the ads . You enter your ZIP Code , pick your television provider , and boom - TV Listings . For further control , you can filter only the channels you want to see listed and move to any time of day you wish . I use this quite regularly , it is way quicker than watching the TV Guide channel and this app is far superior to the TV Guide official app ( which is pretty bloated ) .UPDATE December 2 2013 : The latest version of this app is severely crippled by a bug . You can filter out channels that you do n't want to see in the listings , but the app forgets the channels you have filtered every time you launch it . To me , this severely decreases the usefulness of the app . I 'll be looking for an alternative .	-1
I had this app and loved it . It was a nice simple to use tv guide . They updated it and changed the format a little with some added information . Now I keep getting an error message stating I do not have an internet connection . Well I do have a good connection , everything else works fine . I can even enter the app store and give the updated version a terrible review . Please fix the problem or give us back the previous edition that worked .	-1
Set up was quick and easy but it had the listings in the wrong time zone . I uninstalled it and re-installed it , and it was still incorrect . My cable company is small , and although this app had it listed as a choice , it did not have the correct information for the television show listings .	-1
what 's the point of downloading this app if u can just check your Tv guide ? Also u cant c any Tv shows . ur only seeing Tv listings . I dont like this app .	-1
I get 24 OTA channels , this app only shows 5 of those channels . No thanks , deleted it . Needs to show all the channels .	-1
Loved it at first , flawless ... then when advised it was update time , well , it would n't ! Would not update properly , even tried uninstall/reinstall routine . No help ... sent 2 emails to developers but no response either !	-1
I have a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 . This app has some nice features and one that does n't work for me . Under Settings I should be able to `` Filter channels '' so that I can scroll through only those channels in which I am interested instead of all 542 of them ( similar to the Comcast Favorites feature ) . This feature works for a while then loses my input and I am back to scrolling through 542 channels . I 'll put this app on the back burner until they get this issue resolved .	-1
i 've had this app for a couple of years and loved it but now it does n't show any but ads ! ! no tv listings show at all evrn ehen i verified the channel settings were correct . deleting this horrible app !	-1
I have n't uninstalled it yet , but its slow.I have yet to figure out how the search works , but it is n't terribly obvious.I want to pare down the channels displayed to the ones I typically watch - I 'm not interested in the non-HD broadcast channels , nor yhe premium channels I do n't get . I 'm also nointerested in anything being excreted by Fox Noise .	-1
App loaded fine for few uses , afterwards , it would only display a message that no info is available . I uninstalled from both phones , Samsung Galaxy and LG . Loved the format and ease of use . unfrotunately , it was unreliable .	-1
it is a lot of fun but it is a lot harder than it should be . cant pass level 3 on easy .	-1
The gave had decent graphics and a nice upgrade system . The controls are bad . You can do motion but the response is slow out hand and then you can & apos ; t see the ship	-1
I downloaded this for my Asus tablet and the accelerometer and touch screen controls weren & apos ; t very good . My ship kept bouncing up and down like a low rider .	-1
I was interested in this game , but unfortunately I 'm still using the original Motorola Droid and ca n't afford the space . I wish the developers were more sensitive to space issues ... we need the ability to move apps to the SD ram .	-1
I ordered the game , played it once , and got bored . I do n't remember exactly why I did n't like it , but I deleted it from my collection .	-1
it realy is not worth it , just suck it up and buy a better version . i love spider solitare but do n't really mess with this one	-1
I found that it would lock up and that there were no clear backup key or directions to be found .	-1
Maybe but I 'm not convinced . I happen to like Honeycomb 's standard interface more than dxTop 's but that 's a matter of taste . Objectively , the scope of this app - take near-complete control of my desktop ( and yes , it comes with custom icons and themes ) - was enough of a concern for me to remove it shortly after installation . I asked myself how other , more modest add-ons would perform while dxTop was in charge and I find the answer quickly . `` Application Folder Pro '' , my favorite folder organizer was unusable under the new management . Others apps and widgets may be preempted but that 's as far as my investigation went.If accepted as the alternative interface , the app is deep and complex enough to demand quite a substantial time investment but that would be okay if the rewards justified the effort . In my case ( XOOM , Honeycomb ) they do n't . I was n't able to justify allowing a `` vendor 's '' app to make phone calls on my behalf without me knowing it , just to mention one of the more intrusive rights you grant the app as you install it . And , on a more parochial note , dxTop was stuck in 'portrait ' on my XOOM . There may be some setup option that might change that to 'auto-rotate ' but I removed dxTop before I found it.For 'positives ' , this does appear to be a well-thought , well-designed overlay but it 's a radical departure from Android 's way of interacting with the end-user so one of the first questions that popped into my mind was : if they believe that Android 's interface deserves to be so completely wiped out , why not produce their own mobile OS ? Seriously.In the Android world what I need and in fact I welcome at this time is 'helpers ' such as 'App Folder Pro ' , not a new boss . dxTop tries to make itself the boss and I have not use for that .	-1
Nice diamond concept but I like the original home screens for the DROID x . This is not as intuitive for me .	-1
It 's not really a bad app for free but it makes my fascinate run VERY very slow ... will probably end up uninstalling	-1
it ran slower than stock on droid 2 , loaded the menu slower , and not to crazy about the look . seemed plain looking to me . running droid 2 on 2.2 , and its not rooted .	-1
I have an HTC phone , so I already have all these features with Sense . Not an attractive interface . Functions smoothly .	-1
I have nothing against it . It 's only a launcher . I just prefer to use ADW.. It is fairly stable on my phone . But I just do n't like the way it works .	-1
The Launcher is nothing spectacular , It does n't let you use your own widgets . it removed all of the ones I was using and it could not re add the two widgets that I want to use which was Blizzards Real ID and Fancy Widget pro.The screen is slow to respond on my inspire , and I did n't like that the home screen was now CLEAR to the right and not in the center of their cross setup . Also I gave this link to a friend of mine with an atrix , which has duel cores and a bigger active memory base , he says it also slows down his entire device . so clearly they need to do some heavy optimization.The Lock screen mimic 's the iPhone lock screen , which again is very slow to response and feels clunky and slow to respondThe one touch application menu in the center is a pretty slick idea.The addition of instant access to your Text messaging program is pretty cool , but it ' not really setup for customizationIt has potential but it has a hell of a long way to go to get there.I 'm giving this two stars because it has possibilities and some rather interesting ideas , nothing terrible innovative or remarkable . It just needs work .	-1
I tried this despite some poor reviews , but deleted it right away . I did n't like anything it did to my phone . It did n't slow like some said . No thank you . Droid X .	-1
Can not pick up any police , rescue , or fire in my area . I was very disappointed ! Hope they soon get an app that will pick up fire and rescue and police in my actual county or city !	-1
the product was alright . I was hoping it would have some closer stations to me . but it did n't but overall i think its a good product that can get the station they need	-1
apparently it must not be compatible with this tablet it said it was purchased but could not find it on the tablet	-1
Um at first I used it for a while but , then I started not to use it quite as much as before & now it just seems to pretty much sit there in my tablet computer | [	-1
While this app might be useful in major cities , it is n't at all useful in small towns . The audio streams are from voluntary sources , it is NOT like having a real scanner receiver .	-1
i would like to have the city i live in on here . is there a way to add or what ? someone please help . the city is elmira ny , if that helps	-1
It is not what I expectedit does not function as advertised , not for me anyhowno matter the time or place there is emptiness .	-1
Do n't use it . Could n't get anything too clear . Depends on where you live I suppose . Someone else would have better luck .	-1
battery and usage drain on my cell phone mobile phone . Thid app scanner radio will drain your battery and scanner radio will use up your allowable mobile phone data usage .	-1
Sorry could not write a review , did not keep it long enogh to rate this product.I think I 'll stay away from the scanner radios .	-1
Could n't find my county did n't have good stations that I even wanted I ended up toke it off my device	-1
Do not get this scanner application , it does not receive the stations I was looking for . Glad it was free , have deleted it of the device and the cloud .	-1
Some apps are good , some bad , some work , some do not ! I do/did not like this app because I want a scanner for my town , not a town that is 30,40 or 50 miles away ! ! !	-1
I had a hard time finding something for my area and when I did , very static and broken up . Maybe would be fine in a different area .	-1
The reason I am only giving this app 2stars is because I ca n't get access to scanning anywhere near my area	-1
Set it for my area and have never worked no matter how many times Ive downloaded and deleted it then reloaded it . Sucks !	-1
do n't waste your time downloading . there is nothing on here . I heard a bunch of weird noises coming from it but that was it . Maybe I 'm way out of range but I just did n't see the point of keeping it . I uninstalled it as fast as I could .	-1
will not connect to anything even on wifi no local in city not out n sticks has trains but y listion to them talk	-1
I was unable to access anything on this app . Maybe I just do n't understand how it works , but even for free , I dumped it .	-1
I got this to try to keep track of all the fire trucks that go by and get absolutely nothing . Tried to change directions and frequency but get no audio at all .	-1
Nothing in California . At least not in Sacramento or the surrounding area . They are supposed to be expanding , but I listened to other areas for fun and found it to be very poor sound quality .	-1
Good enough for someone who wants it for `` amateur '' reasons , but it is to laggy for me as a professional to use as a third radio frequency .	-1
I live in a major metropolitan area and this program does not connect to anything in my area . I have try it a few times but to me it is useless .	-1
It is useless . I could not get my local police on here . All I got was static and if you do n't live in a big city just forget it .	-1
I could n't find transmission of signals in my local area . I suppose otherwise this would be OK but for me it was n't worth it .	-1
I did not like this app at all . The scanner hardly picked up anything- even when I switched channels . This app is not for me .	-1
This so-called radio was a piece of junk . poor quality and lousy sound ... not even what I would expect from the chinese these days .	-1
I thought when I got this that I can hear what was going on around my neighborhood but it did n't allow that .	-1
I gave it a 2 star because it not much use for me . I ca n't get any stations around my area . Not very interesting .	-1
I was banned for using a word found in the bible , and the next day in the Boston chat room for calling someone a racist after they said they hoped the bombers are white guys . The help page uses an inapropriate vulgar word as an example of what not to say .	-1
Was expecting something more like one you 'd buy at the store think I was expecting to much for free it may work for others but not for me try it for yourself and see how it works out in your area good luck also do n't like the idea of being told how many words I have to use in my review of any item	-1
I was so excited to try this out but the only way I could have access to what I wanted , I found I had to pay . So much for free .	-1
I down loaded this and waited and waited for it to come up with something . I know things were going on as my husband has a scanner in the garage . I got & # 34 ; nothing & # 34 ; ! Will probably take off my Kindle HD Fire .	-1
I loved this app ... until the last update . When opened , the home screen is visable , but frozen . Its completely unresponsive . I will try erasing the app and downloading it again , but I wo n't allow the update this time . This app quite large , which is rate annoying and seems unnecessary but , in my opinion , worth it if you can get it to work correctly . Using a Samsung Epic Galaxy .	-1
I have not been able to read a book since the new version loaded on my Android phone . The books I already had downloaded to my device would n't open and neither would new books . I 'm stuck in a cycle of downloading to device and then being told I have to remove them and download them again . HELP ! ! ! I see I 'm not the only one with this issue .	-1
Maybe most people do n't care , but I read reviews.Update ddoes n't allow you to read reviews just shows the average ratings I freaking hate this , have to look for books on the browser now .	-1
I used to like Kindle . The app was fast and reliable , and made it easy to read an ebook from Amazon on my Nook Color ( with N2A ) .Then I bought a couple of new Kindle books , and Kindle ( the app ) would not download them unless I updated the app . The new app starts with a gray sphere and freezes there for a long time . Then it loads , and the default screen is not my library but the Kindle store with recommendations . A few buttons later I finally get to select my book and read it . Meanwhile , the app still does n't allow you to group the books by topic.This spells the end of Kindle for me . I 'll move my books over to Calibre , which does n't try to sell anything and does allow for sorting books .	-1
Comics wo n't open to full zoom so ca n't read them , pages turn to quick and messed up slightest touch does something almost everytime , no room for errors here . Not a fan , but try it maybe you 'll have better luck .	-1
I have had the kindle app for yrs . Now ca n't download it from Amazon or play store . Can anyone tell me why ? I 've been reading a book but now ca n't find it.EDIT : Right after I wrote this review the app downloaded . Now a happy camper ! ! ! ! !	-1
I used to love this app to read my Kindle books on my phone , As soon as I downloaded the updates the app does n't work at all , the error message says it failed . Very disappointed.If you have n't updated the app yet , do n't ! !	-1
I have a Nabi.Downloaded it to read ebooks . I was SO excited . Got going , downloaded samples , got hooked , went to purchase the full book to continue on and ... . the books I wanted were suddenly uncompatable with my device .	-1
NO Password Protection - One Click Always ON ! ! I email Amazon and they replied `` at this time , the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android '' . That is a terrible way to do business . It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident . They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet . Anyone ( including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school ) could buy books accidentally . What a shady business strategy ! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon . I expected better from you . This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers .	-1
No way to get kindle format ( azw ) for my aoson keeps crashing no support to get help for this.. really suck 's now I really refuse to buy those kindle books	-1
I have a tin of books on the android version bought a fire where 's my books ? It would seem this app does not work on the fire . Very disappointing .	-1
Amazon , I 've always loved my kindle . I still love my kindle . But the phone app preinstalled with no sign of upgrade or remedy crashes constantly , bringing up an annoying box I have to close.. In the middle of whatever I do . I did n't open the app , I did n't strain it 's capabilities.. I could n't even download a book I own .. Or even my library titles the only time I ever tried to use you weeks ago . What gives ? ? ? ? ? Please figure it out and get back to being my reading companion .	-1
I ca n't get any of my books to open on this . I see them , I download them to the device , but no text . Not happy .	-1
I have been trying to install this app on my Galaxy Tab 2 so I can transfer my book to a single and it will not . I do n't know if the problem is with the Galaxy , I have not been able to get with their customer reps , or with the Kindle app itself .	-1
I find I go to the 'Table of Contents ' often to reread a chapter or go to a favorite chapter . I was also using a Kindle Bible in church to quickly jump to the 'Table of Contents ' then to the chapter ( Book ) I wanted . After this last update there is no '2 touch ' go to contents any more . In fact the `` Table of Contents '' in the menu will not even take you to a 'Table of Contents ' . To change books in the Bible I have to:1. go to the menu2 . choose Navigation3 . from there I can choose 'Table of Contents'4 . choose book5 choose chapterBy then it is too late . Other books do n't have a `` Navigation '' choice . How about a 'Go to 'Table of Contents ' ' in the 'Table of Contents ' tab ... come on this is common sense . Why even call it 'Table of Contents ' if it does not take you there .	-1
I used to love having kindle for android in my phone , but since the last update my phone and kindle account go crazy every time I try to use it . It 's creating multiple accounts for the same phone on Amazon ( nine accounts last time I checked ) , wo n't undo the update , shots down on its own if it opens at all , and freezes my phone . Amazon , do something !	-1
Forcing me to sign in and reload books daily . Amazon saids its a issue with the Galaxy S3 with Jelly Bean , with no idea of a fix . Overseas call center is useless and ca n't speak enough English to understand . Very disappointed , I 've used app for many years with no issues on many phones .	-1
These may seem like minor , insignificant complaints to you , and they would be if there were any legal alternative to the Kindle app . Unfortunately , when I buy an ebook on Amazon , I 'm locked in to their apps/devices , so I ca n't read the book the way I want . Amazon is n't doing me a favor by making an ebook app that works for me , they owe it to me.Margins : When I read a physical book , there are reasonable margins . When I read a DRM-free ebook on a feature-rich open source e-reader app on my galaxy tab , I have reasonable margins between the edge of the screen and the edge of the tablet . When I read a Kindle ebook on the Kindle app on my galaxy tab , I have EXTRA LARGE margins in portrait mode thanks to the built in , non-configurable software margins . When I tilt the tablet a few degrees too far to the right or left ( surprisingly easy to do when you have the tablet tilted back a little ) , I get EXTRA LARGE margins on the top and bottom of the screen , and DELUXE SUPER JUMBO margins on the right and left.Screen Rotation : On my phone , the Kindle app is great . The software margins are n't an issue since my phone does n't have built in margins around the screen , and I can tell the Kindle app not to change orientations when I tilt the phone by pressing a mysterious lock icon that appears when I tilt it . On my tablet , the Kindle app team has decided that users do n't like locking the screen rotation , so they 've completely removed that feature . They say that it 's easy to lock the screen rotation in Android 3.0 , but it 's actually only one click less to lock the screen in Android 3.0 than to lock it in Android 2.X , plus there 's the fact that I do n't want to have to enter Kindle App Mode every time I try to read a Kindle ebook.The only reason I 'm giving it two stars rather than one is because the Kindle app is still at least twice as good as the Barnes and Noble Nook app , for what it 's worth .	-1
The quality of the audio is excellent - selection process is impossible.Ca n't figure out how to turn off the station that is streaming . Ca n't figure out how to search for particular radio stations - the station call letters do not produce the desired station . Lists of stations , songs etc . not in alphabetical or numeric order . Profuse disorganization ! Very unfriendly user interface - at least for this attempting user . No apparent help available explaining how to maneuver the app . I give up !	-1
Downloaded to my RAZR Maxx HD . Seems to work but have other similar apps that are much better . Already uninstalled .	-1
An internet radio app doesnt need to run at startup , and & quot ; send sticky broadcasts & quot ; has been documented by an Android OS developer as something he regrets was made public.Do a Google search on these words to read his comments : regretting sticky broadcast public	-1
I down loaded this app when it was free . I thought I would use it . However , I did not . Was n't my thing and I could n't figure it out . I deleted it .	-1
actually & quot ; Kay & quot ; it in fact says & quot ; find your favorite local radio stations & quot ; . not sure what description you read . you might want to re-read something before you try to quote it .	-1
Being the App of the day I thought it could n't hurt to try . Like another user , apps started to crash . I have a Note ll and everything was running smooth and fine . I removed it last week and now my Note is back to normal . Bottom line , stay away .	-1
this app was ok at first then even when my kindle is turned off it went on when I tried to turn it off it would not work , thus I had no option but to delete it .	-1
Keeps telling me that I need internet access then immediately exits . My 4G LTE connection is FINE . That , plus the stupid permissions mentioned , motivates me to uninstall and enjoy tune in pro , which also allows recording and has multiple timer settings .	-1
There was not much to the game . you touched a water ball and it broke up and hopefully hit the other water balls so they would touch other and on and on . This is a good game for 1st graders on down .	-1
I hated it it was crap do n't get it.jk Jk jk jk JKJK.it was good I recommend it for people entertained easily	-1
Good teaching game . Try and beat the Cpu , test different stratagies . I enjoy this game . Game offers the different skill levels to try and improve ones skills .	-1
It is a good thing this game is free ! I would have asked for my money back if not . Do not waste you time !	-1
First the game plays true then it cheats once the cube is doubled it throws doubles and manages to throw just what it needs for kills . I 've played Backgammon for over 40 years I know a cheat when I see it !	-1
Despite AI 's claim to the contrary , this program cheats . I 've had this one day , played maybe 10 games , and every time I 've put it on the bar it gets out on the first roll . One game it got out three times in a row when I had four covered . And it was n't the same spot open every time . The 6/1 , 3/1 , 4/2 rolls to start the game for them and the 6/2 , 6/3 rolls for me are quite regular , too . And guess how often those open pips get hit ... . Prepare to be frustrated , like with every other computer version you 've played . At least it was free .	-1
Only because I ca n't figure how to play ! My daughter in law loves it ! So , I keep it on my tablet for her !	-1
Having played backgammon on my laptop , I really was not impressed with this one.Found it hard to follow . Needless to say i have deleted it from my kindle fire	-1
I love word search puzzles so i figured i would give this one a try . It is another one of those games that are good for children , but is entirely way too simple and small for adults that like to really use their brain .	-1
This game is impossible to play . Ive tried changing the settings but it dont work . I love playing rl back gammon sobthis was a big dissapointment	-1
The more I played this game , the more often the Ai opponent started rolling doubles nearly every single roll ! ! ! How can you compete with that ? ? And not only that , the doubles were the number it could use the most to maximize moves towards a win ! I 'm sorry to say , but I honestly believe there is a flaw in the game that favors the device when in single player mode . If the rolls were more random , or the gameplay were more 'fair ' , It would definately get a higher score from me , but not the way it is . Also , one othe thing a LOT OF DEVELOPERS IGNORE ; AN EXIT BUTTON ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm not a developer/programmer , but how hard can it be ? Too bad about all this , I love Backgammon ! I read some of the other reviews and most people ( as I do ) that the dice are loaded . The roll should be as random as you can possibly make them concidering the limitations of programming . The differences should be where the AI decides to move the game pieces , leaving more open , or not , depending on the level . The dice rolls should ALWAYS BE RANDOM and have the same probability for both players . This would be the way it happens in real life with two people playing a real game . If the game ever gets updated to reflect better play conditions , my rating will go up .	-1
if you just want to feel guilty about what youre eating , this app is great . however , if you want to know the actual caloric content of what youre eating , this app is a waste . it lacks many selections and key features , and the data that it does have doesnt even jive with the internet	-1
Very very very disappointing that this app does not count calories as it claims . Hopefully someday in the future it will be updated to include this KEY feature . But until then , the developer can count 2 stars .	-1
Only used the app a few times . What seemed pretty cool ( which I got for free app day ) was n't too helpful at all . All the numbers are kind of in a really bland and un-aesthetically pleasing format . I do n't really care for the app much at all , so I uninstalled it from my phone , but it 's still there on the amazon appstore just in case I want to download it again .	-1
I hate to say it , but I really expected more from a ( normally ) paid app . The list of restaurants is disappointingly short and there does n't seem to be a way to add up menu items for a grand total . The app is called calorie counter , but it does n't count anything . It simply allows you to pick a restaurant , look at a list of menu items , and touch each item to see its nutritional values . No pictures , no way to add up the various items to total up the meal , no way to keep track of your history to try to reduce calorie intake and raise protein intake ... nothing particularly useful.This was most disappointing when looking at the list of ingredients at chipotle . It lists out the tortillas , chips , salsa , meat , cheese , beans ... etc . But no way to build the burrito or plate to know what you 're about to eat . I am not a developer , but there is no way this feature would be difficult to add.Lastly , I should be able to enter my calorie intake goals and be able to see where most of my calories come from . Without this feature , it is just an app full of raw data . I am almost certain that I can find all of this information on a single website if I googled it . I really got my hopes up on this app and I ca n't believe anyone would pay $ 3 for this raw and freely available information.This app has potential to be extremely useful . Most of my meals come from local restaurants . Add these features and I might just pull out my phone for something other than words with friends during my meal .	-1
out of the available chains i only have one ! where is Mcdonalds ? ? ? KFC ? Wendy 's ? Taco Bell ? Baja Fresh ? free apps are really sucking	-1
I expected a lot more . Not sure if thats because other calorie counting apps have set the bar so high , or because this one is just that bad . The list of restaurants is extremely short . The app does n't look like anything special , considering the dev 's want money for it . It lacks so many features , features that every other app of this category have . There should be some sense of customizing meals . Even if they did n't go above and beyond , selecting 1 standard size for each item is ridiculous . Some of these fast food sites even let you build your meal and see the totals . Honestly , this is a poor excuse for a calorie counting app . Do n't waste your time.Phone : Droid X ( Android 2.2.1 , Liberty 2.0.1 )	-1
There is no way I would have paid for this app . It 's missing tons of places . Does n't do any more than free apps of the same kind would . No wonder it 's free .	-1
Had to delete because it would not load properly ! Guess I will have to hunt for another app to spell check .	-1
This seamed like a good app . But i had to delete it because my kindle does not come with voice recognition .	-1
This was a really terrible yahtzee game . How can you ruin Yahtzee ? But they succeeded in doing so . Do n't bother .	-1
permissions needed for a simple dice game ? I do n't like how the advertising is located conveniently too close to the & quot ; roll & quot ; bar , the dice ( as you try to highlight them ) , and the options tab at the bottom of the screen . I have accidentally hit the ad countless times and had to back out numerous . times in the middle of a game . ( KFire ) I also dislike that extra 5 of a kind can not be counted as a score for a full house.iI give it 2 stars because the actual gameplay is pretty quick.Going to uninstall to see if I ca n't find one I like better , or at least one that does n't have gameplay functions literally on top of ad links . I got a FAR better Yahtzi game on a CD out of a cereal box !	-1
PARENTS BEWARE THIS GAME IS STUPID DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS STUPID APP ALL YOU DO IS PARK AND PARK AND IT WILL GET BORING AND YOU WILL OFFICIALLY HATE IT DO NOT GET THIS APP ! !	-1
color good . graphics move smoothly but it does not work on my Samsung Instinct 2.2 android OS . i have a small screen . maybe this game is made for bigger newer phones 2.3 android maybe	-1
These permissions are absolutely above and beyond what is required . There is no reason why a simple game application needs to read the state of my phone , and CERTAINLY not the id of my calls . Stay far away !	-1
Unblock me is better . This game is weak . Much better versions out there . Graphics are cool though . I only give it 2.5 stars .	-1
To those concerned about downloading apps and becoming victims of data mining businesses , I 've listed what this developer was asking for on Market vs. the `` dog and pony show version '' you 're now downloading on Amazon ( THAT WILL SURELY BE UPDATED sometime after FAOTD when the developer feels you 've already trusted his app , are not paying close attention , and are `` simply updating '' for some other minor bug fix ) .Permisssions the developer submitted in his AMAZON FAOTD version : ( the version you are considering downloading ... for NOW ) * Read only access to phone state . * Write to external storage . * Open network sockets . * Access information about Wi-Fi networks . * Access the vibration feature . * Access information about networks.The STANDARD permissions the developer currently asks for in his MARKET version : ( NOTE : for both PAID & FREE Market versions identical , and only FREE version has `` ads '' ) * Network communication - full Internet access - Allows an application to create network sockets . * Phone calls - read phone state and identity - Allows the application to access the phone features of thedevice . An application with this permission can determine the phone number and serial number of thisphone , whether a call is active , the number that call is conncted to and the like . * Storage - modify/delete USB storage contents modify/delete SD card contents - Allows an application towrite to the USB storage . Allows an application to write to the SD card . * Hardware controls - control vibrator - Allows the application to control the vibrator . * Network communication - view network state - Allows an application to view the state of all networks . * view Wi-Fi state - Allows an application to view the information about the state of Wi-Fi . ( network comm . ) Anyone who looks at the Market versions can clearly see those permissions are way out of wack to run a `` car version '' of the Block Me game , especially the Market 's PAID version . The developer wants ALL those permissions in BOTH free and paid versions , so in the paid version , you 're paying for `` more game '' and not `` less/no ads . '' The developer clearly does n't care about giving you more `` game '' for the money , because he has no intention of changing the unbelievably invasive permissions that are the poster child for data mining.Now the developer faces Amazon . He knows asking for your phone 's ID and serial number and a list of all the numbers of who you call , and who called you , are going to pop right out to Amazon reviewers as the BIG CLUE that he is data mining . So he takes it out ... . but he leaves in the others and hopes those permissions gets defended as necessary for that wonderful `` leaderboard action '' and `` rate this app '' and `` notify me of bugs '' stuff , as so many unknowing Amazon reviewers DO have a habit of doing to justify keeping the free app they do n't want to part with.READ THE PERMISSIONS YOURSELF and YOU decide how the developer makes a living off this app , what he did to get onto Amazon FAOTD , what all those permissions on the Amazon version add up to ( even WITHOUT the phone serial number request ) , why phone information is wanted by the developer on all other versions but this Amazon one ( for now ) , and what he 'll likely do to update YOUR app once he 's out of the Amazon spotlight.If you doubt the developer will add the phone stuff back , just go right here on Amazon and look at any of the other 16 apps this developer put out here , for instance the `` paid '' version of Bubble Popper . The permission for the phone is IN there , even in that PAID version.P.S . Misspellings in an app itself realllllllly get me nervous as to who is developing these apps and why , especially considering the massive phone ID serial numbers theft originating from Asia . Why they ca n't get or do n't want an English-speaking American to look it over first before marketing to America makes me cock my eyebrow in a BIG way .	-1
This game is exactly like UnblockMe ( which has well over 1000 levels and is free ) and RushHour ( which already incorporated cars , only with better animations and was available as faotd a while back ) ...	-1
this is a terrible product . I purchased this and when it arrived not only was the box ripped but inside the box was a 100 year old sock .	-1
Why does this app need to get your phone call information ? Do n't install . A a a a a a a	-1
Not fun	-1
This program consists of about six single-screen puzzles , each with a few variations . After about 10 minutes of play they begin to repeat . As you move through the games there is no escalation in difficulty or any apparent attempt to select the `` next '' puzzle based on previous puzzles or the child 's success at solving them.In our case my 4-year old daughter got bored even before the first sequence was completed . A little ways after the puzzles began to repeat she closed the app and wanted to watch a movie.On the plus side , this app is `` solid '' ( no bugs and with a finished appearance ) . It also does *not* need any kind of Internet connection to run . ( Some reviewers said it did and I expect they may have been using an earlier version . ) Finally , it runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.In summary , it is good for at least one fairly short sitting .	-1
Cute idea- downloaded for my 3 and /or 5 year old - thing is ... there is no variety so they become bored very quickly . There are different activities , yes , simple puzzle , colors , letters and a few more - however you can not pick what you want to play as they are randomly set up and delivered in groups of 5-6 games or so per round of play -after each round you get a little sticker to place on a board - stickers are cute and fun idea - however they are not saved ( no option ) and you start with blank board each time you begin play -- would have been better if u could keep the stickers in a little album or something . - After about 5 rounds of playing I noticed games were repeating , after about 10 rounds my daughter noticed - just not enough variety or options for a paid app - or an app for kiddos with minimal attention spans ! ! ! I use on Kindle Fire and as with other reviews I read I do not have to be connected to Wifi to play- can play in car , on the go no prob .	-1
I have n't caught any so called & quot ; ghosts & quot ; yet but I think this app is pretty crappy SORRY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I just do n't like apps that might scare the macaroni out of people !	-1
I think this game sucks so do n't waste your time buying it.it said the word handle I 'm like this is dumb . scary but dumb	-1
its alright..maybe . fun prank for sleep oversea but when it & quot ; picks up & quot ; something..it says ramndom words likemilk & amp ; guide ... like what does that even mean ? ?	-1
Not exactly what I wanted . Looking for something to have fun with Grandkids . Just a low tech toy for kids .	-1
this game is so stupid it does n't even tel u wat to do I do n't get it all it is is a bug circle that just spins and a dot shows up apparently that is the ghost and u have ti tap it apparently that gets rid of the ghosts	-1
at first I was begging my dad for this app and when he finnally said yes I got it and it did n't even tell me which way to go to get it it ducks I hare it I cant beleive I wasted my time on this app	-1
I downloaded this and it came up with things like 'AWESOME ' '0KAY ' and other no-nonsense words . deleted it as much time as it took to load .	-1
it is completely fake because i got it no ghosts no words just fake i cant believe i read all the reviews got it and nothing just BORING ! !	-1
it 's kind of boring . it just ... well ... does ... . not much . when I first played it , it worked well , and I liked it . now , not so much . it gets really , and I mean really , boring after a while . I deleted it ...	-1
The app Ghost Radar was a complete waste . Unless you are a real believer in ghosts , do not I REPEAT , do not download this app . I was watching Star Trek and my Ghost Radar said & quot ; CLOTHING & quot ; which I thought was weird , and I saw nothing that resembled clothing . Also , my battery got hot really fast . I do n't believe in ghost . I just thought it would be funny and creepy . Overall , do not download this app .	-1
This app is stupid , you stare at a circle and then it says some random words . That 's all people ! Come on , admit it , this app is stupid .	-1
This app sucks monkey balls . It does n't even work I tried it and it was nada . Defiantly not kindle fires . My friend Lavender says that she tried it with my kindle and it sucked . DONT BUY TURN BACK WIL YOU CAN ! ! !	-1
this game is so stupid all it does is show u a bunch of lines . wow exciting ! NOT ! ! ! ! it does not even show anything on the radar ever . truly suckish .	-1
Total waste of time ! Sure , I do n't expect catching ghosts with it , but I 'd expect some entertainment out of it . And with that mindset , I rate this app total crap ! Hope I quit the app fast enough that it did n't con the advertiser in the ad banner !	-1
Looks cool with all the lights and such but never tells you what you are seeing , how it is possibly picking things up ... just an odd idea for an ereader or a phone .	-1
I got this and it was just for fun . I tried it and at first no red dots . Then a red dot appeared . I was with my sis and so freaked out . All it said was V a million times in the corner . I was so freaked and deleted it . Now downloading it again	-1
im confused on this wierd app . it says things and tries to scare u. nothing happened so far that it said . its just , not the best app ... at all . it is alittle ... .alot ... .creepy	-1
It 's fake . His name is Johnathan and it says random words for a minute I thought it was real but it is n't . Random words pop up and the dots disappear ? ? ! ! Do n't get it its a scam ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Beleave me its fake do n't buy it ! !	-1
if u r a scaredy cat and cant handle scary stuff do n't get it.it is that simple I seriously do n't get why people think its fun to be scared I mean like you are worried what 's going happen just live your life with a clean diaper Ps I think all you horror movie makers are sick and twisted my friend at school said when she was five she saw a little & quot ; ghost & quot ; girl with a jump rope please give me a break people should have better things to do than sit their with a poopy diaper cause you are so scared and you are just sitting there in fear that a & quot ; ghost & quot ; will be in there	-1
You know why you ca n't get it on Kindle Fire ? It does n't have a camera , and all devices you can download on do . It utilizes the camera without you knowing , and it identifies the object and says the word . This explains why it needs so much information- it wires to the camera . I did n't realize this until I read you could n't get it on the fire and it uses a lot of info . If you do n't beleive me , you do n't , but an app ca n't utilize 1,000-5,000 dollar equipment .	-1
Boring did n't get it . Would not recommend it . Want money back . Not worth it not for me . Would not order again	-1
My friend and I were really scared until after five minutes , nothing . showed up . I recommend this app for little wimps . but this is a rip off . Well , it 's not really rip off when you can scare younger kids . It 's still stupid though . : (	-1
I have this application also on my ipad with the same settings and they do n't get anywhere near the same results.so far all I 've gotten are totally wrong words . like & quot ; sister & quot ; . I 've never had a sister .	-1
I thought , our at least hoped , this was some kind of game - there 's another ghost radar app that is actually fun and useful . This , unfortunately is a total waste of time .	-1
Do n't waste your money . I was hoping some how , some way this app would pick up on something . But everytime I moved my kindle a word would just so happen to pop up . It was fun the first day but now it just makes me mad when I turn it on .	-1
Maybe I just do n't know how to work it , but Ghost Radar Legacy does n't seem to be all that interesting .	-1
do n't spend your money on it its fake ti just says random words and the dot go away ! ? ! Not worth wasting money on it or gas prices ! do n't buy it . it dosent work . besides how would a Kindle or an aneroid phone detect ghosts ? ! ? THINK IT THOUGH ! ! ! do n't buy it ! ! ! ! -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- & gt ; : ~ (	-1
I ca n't believe a simple app in a device like a smartphone is capable of doing all that the app claims . Now that i 've 86ed it off my phone , how do I get it off my Amazon d/l queue ?	-1
This app can also be used as an Idiot Detector . If you download it . . . then you have been found : )	-1
as soon as I turned it on , I pointed it at my uncle Griswald and the words serial killer appeared on the screen . Right then and there I knew app was a fake . My uncle Grizzly is so mild mannered and would n't hurt a fly . I told him how it called him a serial killer and he just laughed and laughed ... and laughed..Then he said , be a good nephew and to put the duct tape , rope and hatchet in the trunk of his car because we are going for a little ride . OH BOY , I HOPE WE ARE GOING TO DAIRY QUEEN .	-1
what a waste . angry birds is more useful . $ .99 for this ? You got ta be kidding ! I think I 'll pass on this one ...	-1
This is a toy program not intended to find actual ghosts . I played with it for a bit then found it quite boring . I have uninstalled it but I might fiddle with it again in the future . I am using this on a Motorola Xoom tablet & it never crashed or caused any other problems .	-1
I love the idea of this app , however I ca n't stand the fact that this app takes over my wifi , locking it so NOTHING I owe is allowed to use my wifi network .	-1
At least they could have made the app somewhat entertaining . It spouted off a few meaningless words then stopped . What a waste !	-1
Just read the description.. & quot ; for entertainment purposes only & quot ; ..That 's all you need to know its fake & amp ; a sham . Buy this if you 're the type who 'd spend 2.99/mos . For Dionnes Psychic Network infomercials	-1
Like super lame . We played with it for about 5 minutes before we decided it was a waste of space on any device . Super glad we did not pay for it .	-1
Obliterated my battery . After 5 minutes in a quiet room at work 35 words were heard . I guess my office must be haunted .	-1
its stupid and pointless and ghost are n't even reel when you die you go to heaven or hell you cant go around the earth when your dead ! ! ! ! this is crape its totally stupid and its not real how would the developer get the app to sense all that stuff its crape lies ! ! ! I mean seriously if your stupid enough to beloved this *omg it works I saw a ghost* -_- really ? ! ... ... get a life spud pickles and make something worth our time ! ! ! God loves you : D	-1
what a waste of time . some woman 's voice randomly says words . do n't waste your time . App is junk . stupid . starts up and repeats dump words . it 's not interesting . it is bull oney .	-1
This app confused me and was not set up in a way I enjoyed . Feel similar ? Get period tracker lite .	-1
I was hoping this app was going to allow you to put in several dates , but it only allowed you to put in the date that you started . I was hoping to be able to put dates where cramping or spotting would occur , but that was not the case . This app is a standardized app for those who have the perfect cycle I guess .	-1
not a great game . really basic . will be playing along then it just stops and says you are at a new level . but not sure how you got there .	-1
I tried the app because my boys wanted it . They played it for about 20 minutes before getting tired of it . I played it for about 10 minutes and realized how little I was enjoying it .	-1
Some apps consider a Samsung Galaxy Tab to be a an Android phone and some do n't . This app does n't . I installed , tested a few functions then uninstalled it almost immediately .	-1
Bloomberg was one of the most-used apps on my iPhone so I was excited to see that it was available for Kindle Fire too . Alas , the font size is so small that it 's hard to read comfortably . So I rarely even use it . Looking for an alternative that works on all my devices .	-1
Bloomberg news app is n't Kindle Fire friendly . It works , but can use a serious update . The app itself is clunky and does n't take advantage of the larger screen than phones .	-1
This app appears like it is providing useful information , however does not provide actual live connection information . Try turning your router off , this app continues to give the connected info even varies a bit ti make you think its reading , reporting actual data .	-1
I have a kindle fire ( which u can check the wifi at the top by the settings tool bar ) . I wanted to see how it works so I downloaded it . But I tried to uninstall it but it wont work . Now it 's taking up app memory . ! ! !	-1
I was recently out of town and could only tap into Wi Fi one day out of five even though the hotel we were staying at had Wi Fi as well as aanother hotel and restaurant across the street .	-1
IT does n't do anything the wifi in my phone does n't already do . I do n't really see the point of the app .	-1
Never detects any wifi network although the device is connected . Must have never been tested on the Fire HD 8.9 . Useless . Uninstalled .	-1
Do n't like it . I deleted it . Didnt help me much and I am somewhat good at puzzles working off clues .	-1
I downloaded this for my Kindle Fire as the FAOTD - I tried playing , but could n't get it work - could n't find instructions for HOW to play other than a general description . I The graphics are very nice , but apparently the controls are not . Uninstalled after getting too frustrated with the game .	-1
In this game you need to direct different shades of colors to their correct place , which is not easy if you can not do it quick enough . If you can distinguish them then this game easy , but still not much fun .	-1
hard at first but got easier as I went it is decentI kinda like It but its just my kind of game	-1
Found the touch response a little buggy . Or , maybe my fingers just move too slow . Either way , I found the game more frustrating than fun .	-1
The game works fine . It 's simply boring . The gameplay is extremely slow and there is nothing to keep your interest . There are too many free apps that are so much more entertaining to bother wasting your time with this one . No one should pay for this .	-1
I do n't really see what is fun about this game . It is not complicated or anything , its just boring . Honestly do n't bother with this app , there are way better ones that are way more fun .	-1
The app ran fine on my EVO 3D . I just found it a little boring and not really my kind of game . You just guide colored balls to their destinations like it says in the description.Now that I have that out of the way . I hate Amazon Appstore . Amazon Appstore is dumb . I hope it gets abducted by aliens .	-1
It 's a game . There 's no excuse for games not having app 2 sd available . Games are not essential in any way to the performance of my phone . Therefore they can live on the sd card . Uninstalled .	-1
Seemed like a waste of space on my phone before I deleted it . Even for free , it is not worth the phone memory space .	-1
Kinda cool - but if you have seen it once that is enough - but not that exciting ... ... .rather a waste of space	-1
Got it when it was a free app of the day . I used it for about a week and then forgot about it . Have not used it since .	-1
An impulse download and a huge waste of time . It was difficult to use and I deleted is soon after .	-1
nice graphics..plays fast.. but you loose 95 % of the time . sometimes you have no possibility of winning as soon as the cards are dealt ... .not very much fun	-1
The description made this game sound very appealing , so kudos to the writers of the description . Unfortunately , the game is pretty dumb and does n't really hold interest . I kept thinking it would improve and get interesting , but it did n't . A very very young child MIGHT enjoy it . Otherwise ... .sorry ... not worth purchasing .	-1
Good download and install on my kindle fire . I played ? seven levels of the game and do not understand it . I do not know if I won or lost . I do not know what the objective of the game is . Uninstalled it .	-1
this app would be pretty cool , but it does n't work on my droidx . The app can never find a face no matter what I do .	-1
The app says processing and the proceeds to say that it failed . I tried several times to get it to work with no luck ! Needs better support !	-1
This app will not open on my samsung epic . I click the app and a black screen comes up ... and stays .	-1
This would be a cool app if i did n't get an unknown error every time I try to upload my own pictures . BOO ! Update this so I can have something new to waste my time with . : )	-1
Every time I tried this app , with either a new picture or one from my gallery , i either got an & quot ; Unknown Error & quot ; error ( which is the most useless error ever ) , or a & quot ; Face not found & quot ; error .	-1
This worked great when I first installed it back in Oct on atrix2 ... then it updated ... uninstalled ... reinstalled just the other day and nothing will load : ( (	-1
I had all 3 of my FB 's updating threw the app when I needed to add one more . It would not allow me to . So I removed one so I could add the other . No good . Removed.. Installed ... App only dose one accont now ... . Lame ! ! ! ! ! ! Sent msg to Seesmic and got no reply , so I am rating this app as a 0	-1
Seesmic was a great app . Was ! Now that Seesmic has advertising it crashes while trying to tweet messages . It forces you to shut it down and you lose the text you were typing . I can & quot ; t recommend this app until they fix this problem .	-1
I like Free Cell and I wanted to play this game . However , I found upon installing it that the cards are too small to see . I played the original version of this game on the original Kindle Fire and the cards were easier to read . Please revert the resolution back to the original format .	-1
you get what you pay for . just suck it up and buy a good version this one is very weak	-1
I liked the older version of this game ... it had a decent sized table . Now stacks are hard to read , there is not enough table space.My previous rating was 4 stars , but this update , while making it look more pretty ( and did help with functionality ) are ultimately ruined because the table size has shrunk .	-1
this app seems slow and clunky compared to spider solitaire . old technology perhaps ? I prefer to tap rather than drag . did n't care for the graphics . dated . has to be a thumbs down for me .	-1
Why would a paid app need to access phone serial , calls , state and numbers ? Oh yeah , greedy developers putting adware in a paid app that should contain none .	-1
For this today and keep getting message how program has stopped unexpectedly . You would think the featured game of the day would be a working one . Droid 2 .	-1
How do you play a game that offers no hints in how it works ? You do n't , you quit playing and no you wasted the money on a stupid game .	-1
I enjoyed the game while it lasted , but had completed the entire game in less than 2 hours . I was very disappointed to finish a game I 'd paid for so quickly .	-1
at first it was fun but then it got kind of boring . I did n't really like the game . it should be free ! : (	-1
tried rebooting my droid 2 and still would fc . too bad , these are great games to pass time with . glad it was a free app download and i did n't waste my money .	-1
I ca n't argue with anything that is free but I did not find the game to be any fun at all . I hope to see more fun free Apps and games from Amazon	-1
this app wont even show the first screen for me . it force close every time . I had to uninstall . I 'm running a samsung intercept running froyo 2.2	-1
Dell Streak7 -- force close immediately after launch . I tried turning the machine completely off , still wo n't work . I tried uninstall and re-install , still unexpected program stop.Uninstall permanently .	-1
force closes on Droid x at startup . just black screen and the app closes . shame too cause I really wanted to try this out . Stupid Amazon 25 word minimum .	-1
So short it was n't even worth the 49 & cent ; I paid for it . Wish I could get my $ $ $ back . You can play short games like this online for free .	-1
this game needs a help buttom , to at least help in the aero you are in on the game , i have gotten half way thru and for the life of me i can not get any far on the game ,	-1
This game sucks . It 's not worth the effort and time . It only takes you so far and you get mad and start pounding on your phone . A waste of my time..	-1
I 'm not even going to bother playing this . 15MB is too big to not be able to move it to my SD card . it just does n't make sense .	-1
I love Myst and was looking forward to playing this game . Unfortunately it kept force closing every time I ran it , I even uninstalled it and installed it again with the same results . Had plenty of free ram & amp ; internal memory.LG Optimus S Froyo 2.2.2 .	-1
Glad I got it free . It gives no instructions so you are left guessing the whole game on how to play or what to do next . Plus extremely short game from beginning to end .	-1
love the game style . it was a fun little thing , however the shortness and over simplicity of the puzzles made me feel like i played a demo . i am by no means downing the dev , in fact i wish to ask for more . you could even say i challenge the dev to make something bigger and more in depth . great concept , fun game , but pleeeeeeeeeeeease make a new better longer game .	-1
Fun game that worked once , then force close after force close after force close after force close . Did I mention it force closes ? Too bad really , uninstall . ( Samsung Vibrant )	-1
