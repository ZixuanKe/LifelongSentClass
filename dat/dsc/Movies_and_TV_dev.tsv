This is a gem of a workout and I really wish more people knew about it . It has become one of my most cherished fitness routines . I 've been using this for several weeks now and my lower body looks amazing ! ! ! My hips and thighs have never looked better or more slim ( finally ! ) It is all floorwork , which has seriously gone missing from most current fitness dvds . You will work very hard but the results are worth it.Other reviewers have compared this to the Original Buns of Steel with Greg Smithey and I have to agree . It 's one tough routine . I 've actually been rotating both of these for several weeks and I could n't be more pleased with my results . If you have any issues at all with your lower body , you absolutely need this dvd : )	1
`` The Kids are All Right '' is one of the most honest and intelligent films about family , relationships , and the institution of marriage you 're likely to see or have ever seen . That the central characters are a lesbian couple does n't matter in the slightest . Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko does n't sermonize about homophobia or civil unions or moral values , but rather presents a sincere , complex , and universal portrayal an American family - imperfect and at times highly turbulent , but still loving and committed . There 's no trace of Hollywood idealism ; rather , there 's the sense that we 're seeing real people living real lives with real ups and downs . Movies like this have to be treasured . They show respect for the audience . They involve you rather than make you feel like an outsider.At the center of the plot are Nic ( Annette Benning ) and Jules ( Julianne Moore ) , who have been married for a number of years and have raised two children , one born to each and conceived via an anonymous sperm donor . Despite their relatively normal upbringing , the half siblings - fifteen-year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) and eighteen-year-old Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) , are curious about their biological father and decide to contact him through the sperm bank . Here enters Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , the casual , relaxed , super cool owner of a restaurant serving organic food he has grown and harvested himself . He seems to like the kids . The kids seem to like him . The moms think he 's a little too pleased with himself , what with the way he describes his own success as the result of doing , not learning.Nic , a doctor who has always been the dominant provider , slowly begins to feel as if her world is being stolen away , the kids spending more time with Paul than she 's comfortable with . She drinks wine excessively . She has to be in control of every situation . Jules , less focused but more nurturing than Nic , begins to feel underappreciated , especially now that she has started a landscaping business . As it so happens , her first client is Paul , a turn of events that ties into a reality rarely discussed in the movies but is wisely observed here : Human sexuality is complicated , few falling into definite black and white categories . To say anything more would be too revealing , although I will say that , whatever happens , Paul will be cool with it . Others will be terribly confused . Others still will be hurt very deeply.The characters , written and played with sharp humor and heart , all have qualities that are not only realistic but relatable as well . Nic and Jules love their children and they each other , but as they eventually come to realize , marriage is hard and subject to unexpected turns . Who 's to say who was right and who was wrong in any given situation ? It 's not as clear cut as it might seem . Joni , now a legal adult and on the verge of moving away to college , is incredibly smart , although she feels pressured into being the perfect child of a lesbian couple , and she has not yet acted upon her own emerging sexuality . Laser , less bookish but greatly athletic , has trouble finding that fine line between an adrenaline rush and acts of sheer stupidity . This is especially true when in the presence of his friend , who everyone else correctly writes off as a loser and a bad influence.As for Paul , there always seems to be someone like him in our lives . He 's easy-going and open , although he does n't always think before he acts . Why , for example , did he decide to donate sperm in the first place ? Laser really would like to know . He puts a lot of selfless words in his answer , although one gets the sense that he does n't really know why he did it . Maybe it just seemed like a good idea at the time . Maybe he 's the kind of person that will try almost anything once if it seems fun enough . He 's done many things in his life , but at this stage , he 's cool with running an organic restaurant . Will he be cool with it a year from now ? Five years ? Ten ? He says at one point that he would like a family someday , although he does n't strike me as someone who thinks that far in advance . He lives for the moment . Unfortunately , that may do more harm than good when it comes to Joni and Laser - he 's their biological father , but he 's not their dad.The film is both funny and dramatic , and yet Cholodenko correctly avoids going too far in either direction . It does n't condescend . It does n't emotionally manipulate . It allows the characters and situations to evolve smoothly and naturally , so that by the end , I felt as if I had experienced something truly profound . It helps that that the performances are some of the best of any I 've seen so far this year . Benning and Moore are completely believable in their roles , developed not as tiresome gay stereotypes but as actual people in a long-term relationship ; they 're not without their flaws , but underneath it all , they 're well-meaning and decent . Wasikowska and Hutcherson play teenagers I could truly care about , both having personalities that felt genuine . Ruffalo is in top form , convincingly playing a character that , like a lot of us , has yet to figure things out . `` The Kids are All Right '' is a real winner - one of the year 's best films .	1
As the 180th review , few will read this . I liked the film , the plot , the acting , and the general premise of `` a normal gay/lesbian suburban family '' .What I found fascinating was Annette Bennings ' role as the MALE or HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD . What one sees and finds fascinating is 'the maleness ' she portrays , no doubt what she sees with all the males she connects with , a womans ' view of what men are and their predictable reactions . She plays the character to perfection , as she is capable of . The problem is that the images are generic , simplistic , and stereotypical ( also wry and humorous ) . I could see myself being viewed this way but I did n't feel my maleness captured . Some women friends , asked what makes a man different from a woman , reply 'a certain perversity to their character , and words similar . She was 'HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD ' trying to play 'MALE'.The greatness of Stepford Wives was the inability of men to be able to craft a 'perfect woman ' , either version of the film . The curiosity of this movie , women are unable create the 'perfect male'.Incidentally , I am a white , professional male , 60 's , retired , fascinated with the changes in man-woman relationships we 've witnessed the last 40 years .	1
This is one of those intricate and complex stories that ca n't be properly hilighted or encapsulated in any movie preview ... so whatever preview trailer you may have seen of this movie , just remember there 's much more to it . Although this is an ensemble cast movie , I think Annette Bening deserves most of the credit for her marvelous potrayal of Nic . Annette Bening & Julianne Moore play Nic & Jules , a middle-aged lesbian couple with two children ( conceived from a sperm donor ) . Nic ( Bening ) is a doctor . Jules ( Moore ) is a landscape designer . They have a loving and happy life with their two grown children ; Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) & Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) . But , their lives are disrupted when Joni & Laser decide to contact their sperm donor father ; Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) . That 's the basic premise . But , there is so much more to the story . Laser ( Hutcherson ) has a friend , Clay ( Eddie Hassell ) , who seems hell-bent on dangerous stunts , destroying property , and general teenage self-destruction . Paul ( Ruffalo ) is an aimless man , currently involved with a very sexy and beautiful free-spirited woman ; Tanya ( Yaya Alafia ) , until he meets his biological kids and Nic & Jules . At first , Nic welcomes him into their lives , until Paul has an affair with Jules . This is where the story gets intense ... the tearing apart of the close-knit bond between Nic & Jules , and their children . As I said , Bening is marvelous in her performance . Moore is also very good , though the filmmakers chose to film her in a way to accent every freckle , every wrinkle , and cause her to look flabby , sickly pale and generally haggard ; despite that in reality , she is a beautiful woman with a great body . Speaking purely in opinion ; I think Paul is an idiot for abandoning the great relationship he had with the sexy and beautiful Tanya in order to pursue an affair/relationship with Jules , a confirmed lesbian . But , of course , it 's necessary to the plot , as this affair is what tears the family apart . This is a great movie and a very intense slice of life .	1
I 'm not one to complain about endings , but it the writing left me really hanging ! Too many unresolved sub-plots in the script , and made me want the movie to keep going .	1
The Kids Are All Right is a thoroughly entertaining slice-of-life domestic drama about two kids who look up their sperm-donor father , causing cataclysmic changes in the family dynamic . Not a unique premise save that the parents of the kids happen to be lesbians.The entire cause c & eacute ; l & egrave ; bre for this film is to show straight America how `` normal '' gay families are and that they should n't be afraid of `` gay marriage '' or `` gay parenting , '' thus it does n't delve too deep or wander too far off topic . Political film making is a tricky business . You 'll remember the Tom Hanks drama Philadelphia was maligned by the LGBT activist fringe for all the issues it did n't address ; to which my answer has always been : it 's a two hour film , if you add too many spicy issues you 're left with an unpalatable polemic.The script and direction by Lisa Cholodenko ( High Art ) are tight , well focused and only occasionally heavy-handed . Her characters are fresh , while being stereotypically familiar to pre-conditioned movie-goers . These are folks we know , people we work with and/or live in our neighborhood : `` normal '' people . Is it perfect ? No ; there an almost fatally flawed plot contrivance that seems only there to provide the filmmaker an all too easy source of conflict.What elevates the film above the run-of-mill movie-of-the-week domestic drama is the acting . Annette Benning is staggeringly good as the head of her household - the alpha female in this case . Her performance is embarrassingly rich ; she presents a myriad of conflicting emotions , each one immediately recognizable , true and never over played . Julianne Moore turns in a lovely portrait of the less-successful , less self-assured partner . Mark Ruffalo is a revelation as a forty-something man finally approaching adulthood ; a free-spirit , still capable of making disastrously foolish decisions in his pursuit to find personal fulfillment . Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are always on target as the kids , conveying the perfect blend of angst and innocence.Just as they did with Juno and Little Miss Sunshine , the film community is falling all over themselves hyping this . Like those films , The Kids Are All Right is an entertaining , socially relevant effort and deserving of quantified praise ; but do n't be mislead , it 's not Citizen Kane .	1
Excellent movie . I watch it over and over when I 'm in the mood .	1
While the film is n't necessarily easy to watch- it is rather uncomfortable at times- that equals the genius of it . The characters are all TOO REAL . It does n't hesitate to show what some families are really like.Are all same-sex families like this ? NO.however , all families have unique dynamics and ALL FAMILIES come with their own set of unusual circumstances.This film is just once slice of post-modern family life ... not every same-sex family life , but one story at least.What i really like is that it is normalizing to the relevant dynamic that affects thousands of persons in this world today whom have been born of an unknown sperm ( or egg ) donor.also , the performances are excellent .	1
The Kids Are All Right tells the story of a lesbian couple with two children that were conceived via anonymous sperm donor , but it succeeds by telling it in the same way it would if the couple had been heterosexual . Director/co-writer Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg make their lesbian couple no different from a typical married couple and largely avoid the clich & eacute ; s that could cause this film to be labeled a `` gay movie . `` Nic ( Annette Bening ) and Jules ( Julianne Moore ) are a married couple living in California with their two children Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) and Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) . Nic is a doctor , while Jules is trying to establish herself as a landscape designer after several failed business ventures . Their marriage is a bit rocky , but they have two well-rounded , intelligent children conceived via anonymous sperm donor . Laser , at 15 , has grown curious about his mystery father and asks his 18-year-old sister to find out who the man is . Leaving for college soon , she reluctantly agrees . The donor in question is Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , unmarried , with no children , the owner of an organic restaurant , and naturally curious about these two kids . Joni and Laser find him cool and likable , but agree that their moms must not find out . When they do find out , they insist that Paul is invited over for dinner . Paul is so likable that only Nic remains skeptical of the man.The film is a comedy , but its humor stems from the characters ' sense of humor rather than just exploiting the characters by putting them in humorous situations . The tone is kept light , never getting too heavy but Cholodenko knows not to let dramatic opportunities go to waste . With that said , the film never overdoes the emotional stuff . Where most movies allow an emotional holocaust to unfold whenever a character finds out something devastating , The Kids Are All Right has characters that react much like real people would which makes the emotional scenes very effective and very affecting.While I do n't consider it a misstep per se , infidelity does factor into the plot . This is something we 've seen countless times , but it 's handled much better than it could 've been here . While not always unpredictable and fresh , I found this film so charming , funny , and inspired I can forgive it for being occasionally overly familiar . What this film has is a good script with great characters enriched by how great they 're played by the actors involved.Nic and Jules have been married for nearly twenty years , a marriage which Bening and Moore make believable . They 're not a perfect couple , but they 're not constantly at odds with each other either . They convey the believability of their relationship with body language and their general attitude towards each other ; assisted by the great dialogue they 're given . Both Moore and Bening are perfect and I 'd be torn to choose who gives the better performance . They both avoid the stereotypes , never emphasizing how taboo their characters may seem to some , and they bring such humor and humanity to their roles while playing them as very normal people ; two people who are married , have real emotions , and are struggling to do what 's right while working through a rough patch in their relationship.Mark Ruffalo is almost exclusively responsible for the likability of Paul . The role seems simple enough , but it 's easy to see where another actor could have brought the wrong nuance to the role and seemed immoral and somewhat immature rather than laid-back and comfortable with himself . His final scene in the film is remarkable ; despite his mistakes , you ca n't help feel some empathy for him . Ruffalo brings out Paul 's emotions in a way you really believe someone like Paul would and the way he smiles at Laser in the last moments of the scene brings a terrific amount of closure to his character . If Ruffalo and Bening are nominated for an Academy Award , this is the scene where Oscar voters would decide that . Ruffalo makes Paul one of the most likable characters of 2010 and gives the rare kind of performance that does n't need to be explosively dramatic to get recognition during awards season.The Kids Are All Right is a funny , at times touching film driven by its exceptionable cast . With a lesser cast , I admit this may have been a lesser film but sometimes everything just aligns perfectly . This is one of my favorite films of 2010 , with a cast doing some great work that I hope will be recognized . It 's not a perfect film , but it does so many things right that other films of this kind get wrong.GRADE : A-	1
`` The Kids are All Right '' is a comedy-drama set in California which stars Julianne Moore as Jules and Annette Bening as Nic , two halves of a married lesbian couple who are raising two children , Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) and Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ) and are doing it rather well , despite some setbacks.This film plays out like a hearty home-cooked meal of a film , like `` Life as a House '' or `` Parenthood '' . The only difference is that the central couple of the film is gay . Art imitates life here , as this nuance makes no difference in how the children of this union are raised . Laser and Joni are in the process of growing up to be stable , smart and well-adjusted adults . We are given enough of a glimpse into the kids ' romantic prospects to see that the sexuality of their parents does not impact their own , but we do n't dwell on it . The film does not make a big deal of it for the simple fact that it does not matter.We get a good sense of a down-home environment here , with the only difference being that the parents are both women . Nic is of the fatherly type . She is the stricter bread-winner of the family , while Jules is her compliment . Jules is the softer side of the family , reigning Nic in when she becomes irrational . Nic is the parent you would not want to meet at the front door at 2:00 in the morning if you blew your curfew . Jules is the parent who would wipe your tears afterwards.In the typical curious fashion of young adults , Laser and Joni decide to contact their biological father , Paul , ( Mark Ruffalo ) , the sperm donor by whom both Jules and Nic were impregnated to give birth to each of the couple 's children . Joni takes instantly to Paul , while Laser is apprehensive . When the kids inform their parents that they have made contact Paul , they invite him over to get to know him a little better.The initial meeting is a bit awkward , but we get a bit of backstory on the cute way in which Jules and Nic met , which warms the heart just as any other romantic origin would . Jules ends up accepting Paul 's offer to landscape his backyard , which ends up turning the dynamic between Jules and Nic on its ear.Paul is a bohemian who grows his own vegetables and rides a motorcycle . He participates in the kinds of activities that a teenager would think are cool and therefore ends up becoming , in contrast , `` the coolest parent '' . Through him , Joni begins to find her sense of independence , while Laser feels like he ca n't quite connect with Paul and instead spends most of his time with his loser friend , Clay , whose favorite pastimes include skateboarding off of roofs and peeing on dog 's heads.Paul 's interruption in this family 's daily lives ends up challenging the strength of the family and the union between Jules and Nic . The love between the two of them is palpable and it is rewarding to see everyone remain true to who they really are by the end of the film . Paul ends up getting the short end of the stick , which seems rather unfair , but ultimately his existence here serves as a catalyst to help the family see the bigger picture and appreciate what they already have . `` The Kids Are All Right '' is a film about a family like any other . Upon completion , you will feel like you just finished a great book . You 'll want to recommend this film to anyone who possesses the close-minded view that gay parents can not properly raise children . And even though there will be no loose ends left untied , you 'll still want more from this story . This is such a fantastic film because it does such a good job of ignoring the assumed elephant in the room , because here it is proven that there is n't one .	1
Astonishingly realistic portrayals of people who experience drama without histrionics - like actual mature people do . The story is in turn funny , sad , tense , poignant , and comforting . It 's great to see a movie where the characters are n't caricatures and to see them embodied by such skillful and committed actors .	1
Two teenage children hunt down their sperm donor father ( who gave his sperm to their two lesbian mothers so their half siblings ) , a 37-year-old restaurant entrepreneur with no family or emotional attachments and the father becomes an interloper , having an affair with one of the mothers.The drama is by turns comic , pathetic , and always realistic as we penetrate the motivations of the principals . No scene is wasted . The controlling spouse is played masterfully by Annette Bening who may have done the best performance of all.It 's amazing watching the characters ' unconscious motives unfold , especially the father played by Mark Ruffalo , who , unbeknownst to himself , wants to take over the family for himself , that is to say , take one of the mothers and adopt the children . In other words , he wants an instant family without doing any of the work . He 's in for a lesson.Highly recommended .	1
The first time I sat alone in a theater to watch a movie , which all viewers avoided . I could not stand 20 minutes watching `` Cats and Dogs , the revenge of kitty Galore '' , which is also a first for me . `` The kids are all right '' started with porn and perverted sex that could easily sway people to avoid the movie theater . From the start to end , the lesbian breadwinner portrayed a mean and ugly image of human existence , with foul language and obsession with anal and genital imagery in every theme of her reasoning.The choice of characters was perfect . The dominant female lacks any feminine attraction , mimics the hash and crude masculine aggression and dominance and relies on financial power to subdue her sexual target . The subordinate female partner lacks security and self esteem and must rely on the breadwinner to ensure her survival . The two siblings have no alternative but love and accept those who made their survival all possible . With such shaky dependence , everyone is entrapped for life . The weak is shackled by guilt and debt . The dominant fears the breeze of fresh air . The innocent kids must assimilate the guilt of their parents with the confusion of growing up.The first offspring went to college with big hugs , kisses , and plenty of tears and must be grateful for the rest of her life for such unconditional support . The second offspring returned home for few years of figuring out why lesbian women entertain gay sex . The two lesbian lovers have convinced themselves long enough that they were duly married and that their love could live a little longer . The sperm donor spread his sperms everywhere he could possibly reach with little chance to settle roots.The movie `` Splice '' made a similar argument of tampering with human and animal genes and ending up with a monstrous creature . Here , the monster lies within . The fear , the confusion , the lack of faith , the daily and frequent use of vulgar language , the alcohol , and the smoking all turned existence into unabated suffering .	1
****1/2One of the most striking things about the `` feel-good '' drama `` The Kids Are All Right '' is that the characters are not always all that easy to like . They can be moody and naggy , petulant and prickly , immature and self-absorbed ; they do and say a lot of stupid , immoral and hurtful things - yet we never question the love they have for one another.Annette Benning and Julianne Moore play Nic and Jules , a middle-aged lesbian couple with two teenaged children , 18-year-old Joni ( Mia Wasikowaski ) , who is all set to go off to college , and 15 year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) , who 's become suddenly curious about the anonymous sperm donor who is his biological father . After some initial hesitation on the part of Joni , the youngsters set up a meeting with the man , a never-married , motorcycle-riding restaurateur and all-around free spirit named Paul ( Mark Ruffalo ) , whose sudden insinuating of himself into the life of the family results in a great deal of consternation and tension for all concerned.The relationship dynamics in the screenplay by Stuart Bloomberg and director Lisa Cholodenko are intense and complex . With a career as an obstetrician , Nic is the more `` grounded '' of the two women , even though she may be a borderline alcoholic and secretly resents the fact that the more fitfully employed Jules does n't seem to be able to pull her own weight financially . This leads to a tremendous amount of tension between the two , a condition that is greatly exacerbated when the less self-confident and less uptight Jules steps across a clearly forbidden line in their marriage . Nic and Jules also seem to be suffering from the `` fatigue-factor '' that seems to creep into just about every relationship once the individuals have been together for too long . They have even begun to question their feelings for one another , and wonder if the love that was once there so intensely still exists at all - or whether they 're just staying together because it ` s safe and comfortable to do so and the thought of starting over with someone else is just too daunting a prospect to seriously contemplate.Meanwhile , Paul falls in love with the idea of becoming a dad to two grown kids he clearly likes , but his own unrealistic expectations and lack of maturity threaten to doom any efforts in that direction . The kids , meanwhile , who often seem more keenly aware of what is going on than the adults involved , frequently become collateral damage in the battle of relationships being waged around them.Benning , who 's already garnered universal praise and numerous awards for her work in this film , is not afraid to bring a harsh edge to the role of the often overbearing Nic , almost daring the audience not to like her at times . Moore has the less flashy part , but she nicely conveys the insecurity and vulnerability of the character she ` s playing . Ruffalo perfectly captures the well-meaning clumsiness of a man too long used to being focused on his own needs and desires to suddenly become a man dedicated to the lives of others . And Wasikowska and Hutcherson are appealing and touching as the kids who may be all right in the long run but who are going through some pretty tough times at the moment.The major selling point of `` The Kids Are All Right '' is , of course , that it centers around what many in society see as an `` unconventional '' family , yet the movie itself could n't be more universal in what it has to say about what it means to be a family and what it means to be in a committed relationship . Marriage and family are both demanding , complex and messy things - no matter the genders or orientations of the people involved - and this film drives home that fact with unerring truth .	1
This is one of those modern , unconventional California families : two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor , whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so . Conflicts ensue as the couple 's problems surface with a vengeance , one partner has a fling with the donor daddy , and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.The actors turn in very strong performances here , and the script and direction are good as well . It is not suitable for everyone ; the very traditional or strictly religious will be put off by the lovemaking between the women , although it is not graphic ; and by the whole arrangement of their family . Others , though , may enjoy it .	1
I watched this movie at the theater and I loved It , it is a great movie to watch if you are a fan of old style video games . I highly recommend it .	1
I loved this movie when it came out in theaters , and I still love it now . It 's snappy dialogue , outrageous visuals , and surprisingly well-choreographed action all made it my favorite summer movie of 2010 , despite the fact that almost no one here in the US saw it . There are a few issues with pacing in the middle of the movie , but overall it 's just pure zany fun.The Blu Ray edition has lots of great extras on it , including some really interesting commentary tracks , and all in all the set is worth the price , whether you already love the film or are just discovering it for the first time.All that said , I was very disappointed in the video transfer on the BD . This movie screams to have a top notch transfer , with eye-popping FX and a vibrant color palette . Sadly , the colors are muted , and the image is n't nearly as sharp as it could be . Honestly I did n't notice any difference between the visuals on the BD and the TV broadcast version , which is a real disappointment.The audio transfer , it should be noted , is quite good , so no worries there . But the ho-hum picture almost had me knocking this amazing movie down to 3 stars .	1
My son loves this movie , it provides the kind of mind bending teenager stuff that teens are attracted to and it is just adult enough for adults to have fun as well . There is nothing like having to prove yourself to a girl , but seven evil x 's ? Wow how hard can it get ! Very funny , romantic , twisted enough to make one think for a second before the roller coaster takes off again .	1
Scott Pilgrim ( Michael Cera ) is a lanky , mopped-topped 20-something bassist for a Toronto garage band called Sex Bob-Omb . Scott , an unlikely heartbreaker who has a habit of going through girlfriends like he goes through those stylish graphic t-shirts he wears , is dating 17 year-old Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) while trying to get over his previous valet , Envy Adams ( Brie Larson ) . But Scott breaks it off with Knives when he encounters Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) , deadpan Amazon delivery girl who dyes her hair a different color every week . But if Scott is to keep dating Ramona , he must defeat her seven evil exes , such as mystically powered Matthew Patel ( Satya Bhabha ) , movie star Lucas Lee ( Chris Evans ) , superpowered vegan Todd Ingram ( Brandon Routh ) , and music mogul Gideon Graves ( Jason Schwartzman ) in video game-inspired combat , all while trying to win a record deal in a Battle of the Bands competition.Recent movie adaptations of comic books have attempted to ground themselves in realism . However , Scott Pilgrim vs The World , directed by Edgar Wright ( Shaun of the Dead , Hot Fuzz ) adapted from the Bryan Lee O'Malley 's series of books , gleefully embraces the surreal elements of its source material . The books reference and utilize tropes from video games , comic books , and Japanese anime and manga , and the film also utilizes those elements with splashy effect . When characters get punched , graphics like `` Poom ! '' and `` K-Row ! '' pop up on screen . When a bell rings , the word `` R-I-I-I-I-N-G ! '' flies across the screen . Characters launch into high-flying kung-fu battles while those around them look on without much shock . And when characters are defeated in battle , they burst into a pile of coins . It is one of the most literal interpretations of a comic book ever committed to film , and you could hold drinking games for all the references the film makes to popular - and not so popular - culture ( The Legend of Zelda , Final Fantasy , Seinfeld , Dance Dance Revolution , just to name a few ) . What the film lacks in realism , it more than makes up for with sheer fun in the absurdity of it all.It 's also worth mentioning the fun array of characters brought to life by the actors portraying them . Michael Cera seems to be amounting a good fortune by playing awkward losers , so whether you like him or hate him , he fits the role rather well . And for once , his character `` mans up '' toward the end of the film . Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Ramona as a dry , aloof girl trying to escape the broken relationships of her past . Ellen Wong 's Knives Chau is a hyper-emotional schoolgirl straight out of Japanese anime and manga , and Kieran Culkin steals just about every scene he 's in as Wallace , Scott 's `` cool gay roommate , '' who acts as Scott 's personal peanut gallery during Scott 's battles.Scott Pilgrim vs . The World is one of the most fun , imaginative action-comedies in recent memory , and more than a worthy buy .	1
Keeping in mind that I despise Michael Cera , I absolutely loved this movie . The special effects are so close to videogaming that I would caution anyone to NOT hold a gaming controller during the movie . The acting is good , but realistic ( thanks to the down-to-earth dialogue ) and the movie does its very best to avoid disappointing fans of the graphic novel series . If that is n't enough to convince you this is worth a watch , my girlfriend dislikes Michael Cera as much as I do and is not a gamer-gal . Fifteen minutes in , she was completely into it .	1
I must say that Michael Cera is far from an action star but however he plays the part of Scott Pilgrim really well . The movie was full of humor and action sequences that will keep your attention throughout the movie . This is definitely a Blu Ray you have to have in your collection .	1
Okay . I 'm writing this review as a fan of Edgar Wright 's body of work ( Spaced , Shawn Of The Dead , Hot Fuzz ) .I saw this film theatrically ( one of the few apparently ) and I must admit I was lost at several points and thought the film dragged mercilessly . It seemed like it was all FLASH and no SUBSTANCE , as with most summer films . This struck me as particularly heartbreaking because Wright 's previous work meant so much to me.Fast forward to the Blu Ray release ... Watching this movie at home , and having a son who read the books AND is an avid gamer , really helped me sort things out and find the humor amid all the bells and whistles . Do n't get me wrong , I found some significant humor in my initial viewing but knowing what the little subreferences mean helped tremendously.I have to admit , it 's become a favorite of mine ... and Brandon Routh 's portrayal as Clash At Demonhead 's vegan supreme bassist Todd is one of my favorite movie moments of all time . If you 've seen this movie , you 'll no doubt pinpoint his performance as one of the highlights and is side splittingly funny .	1
I was dragged to watch this movie by my comic book loving boyfriend . He has made me see most comic to movie films and while I like a handful of them , most of them I just casually like . This movie was different . It had a style that is n't seen in most movies . The lay out of the movie is much like the Spirit . I did n't care for the Spirit that much but in the same way they create that story with the back drop as if it were a true comic book , they did the same for Scott Pilgrim.I was laughing the whole time and found this to be quite hilarious . Definitely see it if you play a lot of video games from the 90s and you want a mindless movie . This has got to be one of Michael Cera 's best works yet .	1
OK , maybe the title is a bit of an overstatement . I 'm in my 20 's , and I think this movie displays what my generation wants reality to look like . This movie merges video game `` highlights '' into daily life , such as : a hot girl melting snow around her , receiving coins from a defeated enemy , and cool sound effects when you do something good ( or bad ) .There is a great story and great acting . I am told that it follows the comic books really closely.Definitely a cool movie .	1
I 'll admit that the first time I watched Scott Pilgrim I did n't entirely buy into the hype . I liked the film , but a lot of people have had such great affection for this movie I did n't really see what the big deal was . Watching the film a second time , I was astounded by how much I liked it . If another more inventive film was released in 2010 , I did n't see it.The story is based on a graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley , but I 've never read or even seen a physical copy of this series so my review for the film is based on the film 's own merit.The film takes place in Toronto , Canada where Scott Pilgrim ( Michael Cera ) , a 22-year-old , plays bass in a band called Sex-Bob-omb , lives with a gay roommate ( Kieran Culkin ) , and is dating a 17-year-old high school girl named Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) . After Scott meets the girl of his dreams ( literally ) , American Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead , whom I found incredibly attractive in this film ) , everything seems to fall into place . The only problem is , if he wants to date Ramona he must battle and defeat her seven evil exes.Much of the cast is filled with familiar faces including Brandon Routh , Chris Evans , Anna Kendrick , and the terrific Jason Schwartzman and all the actors within seem to be having a lot of fun . It 's true that Michael Cera is basically playing the character we are accustomed to seeing him play , yet he fits this role perfectly . I ca n't imagine an actor more perfect to portray Scott Pilgrim.Now , a lot of people take certain movies too seriously . They can suspend their disbelief for a movie like Transformers , but when they 're watching a film that begins as a highly-stylized romance and suddenly turns into a cinematic video-game , they have issues accepting it . I admit that this is not a movie for everyone , but those who call it `` stupid '' simply do n't `` get it . '' That 's not to say you do n't `` get it '' if you just do n't like the film , but no one can dispute that this is an intelligent , well-rendered film . With that said , I am 18-years-old and while watching the film I wondered if it would or could be enjoyed and appreciated by someone much older than myself . The creative elements throughout the film ( even much of the dialogue ) are representative of the years I grew up in and on many people of my generation . While no one can really say until years from now , I think that , in a way , Scott Pilgrim may be more of a `` generation-defining '' film than The Social Network.Edgar Wright co-wrote the screenplay with Michael Bacall and I was surprised by how well-written the film is . To a lot of people , Scott Pilgrim functions most noticeably on a visual level but the writing is both fun and energetic . The humor will definitely only appeal to certain tastes , but I found it quite witty . The dialogue is written in a quirky , witty highly-stylized ( a description that can be used to describe most everything about this film ) lingo that , while memorable , does n't become an annoyance as it did in Juno . The writing is really the heart of the story for in-between the extravagant action sequences , there 's a nice love story with likable characters.What elevates this material significantly is the creative vision of director Edgar Wright . Not being a reader of comics or a player of video games , I may be a little out of my element here but , I do n't believe another director has come closer to bringing both a comic book and a video game to the screen than Wright has with this film . The battle scenes are literally a video game put to film , with Scott even picking up tokens after defeating Ramona 's exes . While I 'm not a gamer , I recognized many of the video game references and there are many of them , with even the Universal logo being one . The way Wright chooses to film the smallest things , like the unique look of Sex-Bob-omb playing , is delightfully clever . It 's clear that Wright put every ounce of creative energy he had into creating this world and I ca n't imagine another director pulling it off as flawlessly as he does . It 's too early to call the film innovative , but I 've never seen anything like it . While marketing has made it look like a teen action-comedy , Scott Pilgrim is a highly artistic film with vibrant imagery and boundless energy . Even the soundtrack , fashioned by Nigel Goodrich , is energetic ( there 's that word again ) and atmospheric while not being something I generally listen to.Scott Pilgrim is not an intellectual film , but it is a high-minded one . While I do n't know if it 's a comment on the videogame/hipster subculture , a satire of various trends , a homage to those trends , or a combination of everything I do recognize it as a terrific skewering of pop culture . Whatever the case , Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most inventive , original film of 2010 that I enjoyed and appreciated even more the second time around . While it was not a box office success , it 's already gathered a substantial fanbase and I predict this film will become a certifiable cult classic with the appreciation , love , and respect for it only growing as the years pass by.GRADE : A-	1
This movie is amazing ! ! ! I had no desire to see it when it was in the theater because I did n't really care for any of Michael Cera 's characters . That has changed ! I loved this movie and basically everything about it ! ! Its different and fun and SO funny . I do n't think any other movie has ever made me literally lol every 5 minutes or so ! ! I love the characters , the music , the crazy plot ! Its such creative and different plot ! Love video games or garage bands ? Then you will LOVE this movie ! I also just found out this movie was directed by Edgar Wright who also directed Shaun of the Dead and my favortie TV show ever , Spaced ! Now I must go and read the comics where this movie came from ! !	1
Awesome movie ! Arrived promptly . Very good price . No complaints here . You should definitely give this movie a shot soon ! Michael Ceramic makes this movie .	1
It seems that Hollywood , as always , never quite gets the things they take an option on to make films from . A best selling novel ends up omitting the things people loved about it for the flashier scenes . A TV series has the heart of it tossed aside for the shiny surface of the recognizable characters . And comic books are more often than not done as if the film makers had a fear of making a movie that , well , looks like a comic book . Until recently comic book based films tossed aside all that made them what fans loved and instead turned them into stereotypical films that used the characters names and little more.SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD is not one of those films . Director Edgar Wright , who made SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ , understands what fans of this comic book loved . The quirkiness of the characters , the unimaginable situations and the slam bang fight sequences that comics fans adore . Yes Wright understands these things , gets the fact that comic fans look for them and doses them out slowly but surely here.Scott Pilgrim ( Michael Cera ) is an early twenties something guitar player in a band that has yet to find success . Having recently found a new girlfriend in high school student Knives Chau ( Ellen Wong ) , things are looking up . The band has an important gig coming up that may land them an actual contract and a chance at being paid . And then Scott sees Ramona Flowers ( Mary Elizabeth Winstead ) .Quickly dumping Knives , Scott sets his sights on Ramona , attempting to gain her favor . The pair eventually take a liking to one another . But then something odd happens . One of Ramona 's ex lovers ' shows up and challenges Scott to a duel to the death . For some odd reason , all of Ramona 's seven ex lovers must battle anyone who wants to be her new boyfriend , an unfortunate circumstance for Scott.Until this point the movie seems a bit slow , but that 's all to set up what follows . We get to know the characters , where they stand in one another 's lives and how they fit into the story . Once the ex lovers appear to duke it out with Scott , the film veers quickly into the whole comic book world of ultra violence that never gets much more serious than a Road Runner cartoon . Kicks land people across rooms , into skyscrapers and disappearing . And no one ever questions if this is right or not let alone police showing up to ask what happened . It 's accepted as part of the story.As the ex lover count winds down we finally find out the real reason for the battles , just how they began and why Scott must defeat each one if he is to claim the hand of Ramona . It 's an interesting journey and one that offers some dynamic visuals and fight sequences . Keep in mind though this is n't a serious film by any means but more of a fun filled adventure with plenty of humor.So is it a good movie ? Yes , it is , though as I said you have to give it a bit of time for it all to come together . As it began I found myself thinking oh no , another Michael Cera movie where he 's all teen angst and he 's a goofy dorky nerd who ca n't put a sentence together without seeming pathetic . But it is n't that at all . And while I 'm not the biggest fan of Cera , he actually does a good job here as does the entire cast.But it 's the comic book come to life portion of this movie that makes it worthwhile . Not just in the fact that this world involves seven ex lovers who come back not to reunite with their past girlfriend but to stop her from having someone new in her life , no that 's not enough . We even get the chance to have the long loved graphically displayed sound effects projected on screen for us . If `` POW ! '' is the word on the page then `` POW ! '' actually shows on the screen.I 've only read on SCOTT PILGRIM comic and was n't thrilled with it . I am a fan of Edgar Wright though . And with this film he solidifies his role as one of the better directors that have come along in some time . While this film did n't find the audience that the studio thought it would , it might be one of those films that finds an audience on DVD . If you 're looking for something a little different , a little fun and definitely tied to the world of comics , you wo n't do much better right now than SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD .	1
I had no idea what to expect from this movie . It was really imaginative and very funny ! I liked it a lot .	1
A pop-culture smoothie blending old school video games , live action anime , and mumblecore cinema with a squeeze of the 60sBatmanTV show . The proportions are just right to deliver a tasty treat . Michael Cera 's stock Michael Cera character plugs perfectly into the story . I know he 's making bank playing this character but , good god , I 'd like to see him do something different . Even Schwarzenegger shows more range than this .	1
im really satisfied with this blu-ray edition.not only it comes with a DVD , the blu-ray must have been about 6hours long , if not more.if im not mistaken theres 2 90min extra and another 45min feature with tons of trailers and TV spots , music specials and lots of commentary with the cast and writers .	1
This movie was soooo retardedly good it 's scary ! I have watched it seven times so far and all the little bits that pay tribute to my inner geek just keep me coming for more and with a huge grin !	1
First off , this is not my account . I 'm using my dad 's . ( I 'm 13 ) Anyway , I thought that the film looked so-so when I saw the trailer , but my dad was definitely not interested . I did n't get to see it in theaters . When it came out on DVD , he would n't let me rent it , thinking that it was stupid . Well , just a week ago , I saw the movie at a friend 's house . I loved it . I got my mom to take me out to buy it . After I purchased it , I could not put it down . I 've watched the movie seven times , the cast commentaries , the bloopers , and the deleted scenes . I 've loved every minute of it . Be warned . If you have important business to do , such as school work , do that first . This movie is addictive .	1
Having limited knowledge of the S.P . graphic novels I thought this movie was going to be a low brow childish comedy . Wow I was totally wrong . It had a really fresh way of presenting a story . All the characters are likable , even the minor ones . I 'm sure this form of storytelling will be emulated in the future . It could be that I 've seen so many movies that I 'm a bit jaded on all the generic junk out there , but when a movie like this comes along it deserves credit.I saw this move with more than 10 people and everyone loved it . I saw it again in the theater with my wife and she loved it too . You will love it . See this movie as hard as you can . I realize that the over-marketing of Michael Cera may have been what killed this movie in the theater , but give it a chance . Do n't write it off because you dislike mike Cera . In fact he should write you off if you fail to watch this movie . 99.994 % of people like this movie . The people that do n't probably fell asleep like the one lady that gave this a bad review . She should write the whole production staff an apology letter . I 'm going to assume she had no understanding of all the inside jokes about video game , manga , and such . I 'd probably sleep through the sex and the city movie , but you do n't see me writing a negative review on Amazon about it.This movie made me feel young again and reminded me of the days I used karate to explode robotic dinosaurs . That may not have happened , but this movie made me feel like it did . I 'm going to go watch this again and blow like 7 holes in the moon .	1
It 's a good techno-geek movie , but it had potential to be great . I am not sure exactly what it was about this but i left feeling slightly like it was missing something . Anyhow ...	1
THe same year Kick Ass came out was the year that a far better and more entertaining film called Scott Pilgrim vs. the World came out . Although this film does not follow the comics closely at all , it was still an entertaining and many feels movie .	1
THIS WAS SO TOTALLY AWESUM AND I LOVE THAT THIS MOVIE GOT TO ME ONLY A FEW DAYS AFTER ORDERING IT .	1
I really was n't expecting too much , but Michael Cera once again is able to deliver in his inimitable teenage angst manner . There are tremendous sight gags , sound effects , Seinfeld allusions , and Jason Schwartzman really hits his stride as a villain . Warning : Not for preteens , especially the bonus features which explode many f-bombs .	1
This story was very fun and unique . It diverged in its storytelling method quite a lot . This could get a bit overwhelming when you 're just trying to watch a fun show . However , overall the story was good and it was a fun watch .	1
Who ca n't love a movie like this ? It signifies what the movie industry has lost , fun ! Every time I watch this movie I find myself wanting more , it 's just so darn fun I feel like I 'm playing a video game .	1
A unique and fun movie . Edgar Wright did an awesome job directing this movie . Probably Michael Cera 's best performance to date .	1
I love this movie i love the video games thyem through out the movie its cute and not a chick flick	1
Scott Pilgrim vs . The World brings a graphic novel to life , with the only cliches being intentional targets for satire . Successful on all fronts -- you do n't have to be a lover of the genre to appreciate it , and lovers of the genre will have no flaws or compromises to apologize for .	1
This movie is a perfect example of a movie that represents an entire time period . The early 2000s are heavily represented here with many nostalgiac references to hundreds of games .	1
no idea why it didnt do good in theaters because the movie is amazing . everyone i watch it with says they ve never seen anything like it and laugh the whole time . one of my favorite movies	1
Yeah I loved it ! Mr Six risked it and nailed it with this.You haveto watch it , you will never want to travel with a compatible friend ! It will make you do n't want to see , but you ca n't turn your head .	1
Every motive of a genuine horror film is to disgust the viewers , put them mentally in an uncomfortable situation while witnessing events , that isall horror movies are all about , they are meant to disgust you , and this film succeeds in doing so . So , what makes this film appealing ? no , there are no special effects or aliens or zombies around , but there are far more terrifying surprises here , for you . 'The Human Centipede ' is a rare gem , which brings on a whole new terrifying atmosphere than the typical horror atmospheres experienced , and while watching it , you will question yourself ample of times , `` Can this ever happen ? '' and if you are expecting a typical start with a thrilling atmosphere and which will finally conclude happily , you are sure to disappoint yourself because , there are no super heroes here , no guys rescuing girls or simply any special miracle to happen or the regular things witnessed in a regular horror film , what you fill find here , is fear , despair and an uncomfortable atmosphere around that will genuinely disgust you . A very rare gem of a film !	1
A nut sews three people together ass-to-mouth . OF COURSE IT 'S SUPPOSED TO BE REVOLTING ! Hell , the title alone is sickening . Try rating from this perspective and I think you 'd give it at least slightly higher ratings.It was , at least , ( 1 ) very original , and ( 2 ) the guy who played the doctor is one helluva horror movie actor .	1
In an interview , Tom Six , the director of The Human Centipede , said that his movie explores the nature of humanity . Dr. Heiter , a renown surgeon , known for his ability to separate conjoined twins , has no true understanding of humanity and the bonds that bring us together . He dreams of having such knowledge , but in his twisted mind , such bonds come from forced interaction , a forced need to cooperate . Thus , he creates the human centipede , attaching three young victims , head to tail , so that they crawl about on their knees , unable to do anything without cooperating.And they do , but not in the way Dr. Heiter expected . They learn to fight back , to escape , like Frankenstein 's monster taking revenge on the real monster , the one who created him . But they do this because they are human , not because they are learning to be human . They feel each other 's fear and pain , they hold one another up , they forgive one another what they can not control.Yet , did Six have to make his points ( and there are many in this deeply layered film ) in such a degrading way , making us feel like depraved voyeurs to want to see these three people survive and wreak havoc ? There are times when he seems to be indicting the audience as much as Dr. Heiter . I 'm still not sure if this film is gratuitous , or highly effective or both . But if you can stand it , and want to see how these questions arise and are answered , then see The Human Centipede .	1
Since i never heard of this movie coming out in the big screen i 'd thought to myself , how good can this movie be . But after watching the movie in disgust ( cause of the scenes ) . I thought to myself this movie is going to be a cult classic cause of its originality and good acting .	1
when swatching human centipedce i found myself saying i casnt believe someone actually came up with this.a movie that will stand the test of time for shock value alone .	1
The film is both compelling and utterly repulsive and ghastly . As the mad fiend was `` constructing '' his centipede , I doubt there was n't a viewer who was n't preoccupied by -- to put it as delicately as possible -- the ultimate step in the human digestive process.Nevertheless , I found it difficult not to chuckle at the obviously distasteful thoughts that must have been running through the minds of the unfortunate victims . Let 's hope that no one has beans for lunch.It 's easy for people to say that the film is `` sick '' and that only a deranged person could come up with such a story . To them I say , `` get off your high horse . '' Creativity does n't always have to yield great artistic works . Yes , the film 's premise is disgusting , but if it moved you in one way or another , then it served a purpose .	1
Joe Bob Briggs would love this movie . If you know who he is , you know what I mean . You have three levels . Terror , Horror and Total Gross Out . You want to make the audience feel terror . If you ca n't do that , you go for horror . If you ca n't horrify them you go for the total gross out . This movie skips the first two . It knows what it is , and makes no apologies . Classic Gross Out movie .	1
Listen to the concept or watch the trailer of Human Centipede and you will immediately know if this movie is for you or not . Nothing will change after watching it either . I could not believe the idea and was so intrigued ( and a bit disgusted , but in a good way ) that I was enthrawed throughout the entire movie.Is it a perfect movie ? Not at all . There are a few storyline flaws and holes , but the whole point of this movie it what it says it 's about . What 's the funniest part is comments people make about the goriness of the movie . It actually is fairly tame compared to Hostel , Hills Have Eyes , The Collector , and other gore-porn type movies . I think it 's just the idea that freaks people out.Just settle down , drink some alcohol , and enjoy this f 'd up ride !	1
I thought that this movie was pretty good and thrilling up until the end . The end pretty much closes out the movie with the viewer asking questions . There were also a few parts in the movie that I had to rewind just to understand . Overall , I 'd say I definitely would recommend this movie .	1
`` If you believe in God , '' says Reverend Cotton Marcus ( Patrick Fabian ) , `` then you must believe in the Devil . '' This eternal clash between good and evil is the backbone of Christian faith , and Marcus understands that . Growing up in Baton Rouge as the son of a preacher , he was groomed to become one himself at a very early age ; looking back on his life , he admits to the camera that , while he learned plenty about behaving like a preacher , he never really learned about what he was preaching . He plays the part of the pious evangelical beautifully - boisterous , flashy , always with the loud , slick talk about Jesus and God the Father Almighty and crying , `` Amen ! '' But what does he really believe ? He is n't sure when the film starts , but when the film ends ... let 's just say that , at that point , a crisis of faith is the least of his problems.Of one thing , he has become certain : Demons do n't exist . Having performed many exorcisms , he candidly explains that , although he has never been a doctor , he has served as a healer for those who believed they needed healing . All he had to do was put on a performance and maybe sneak in a few special effects . But then came news of a supposedly possessed autistic boy that was suffocated to death during an exorcism ; for Marcus , a line had been crossed . What if that had been his own son , who survived after being born prematurely ? How could he continue pretending to cast out demons knowing that medicine and not Jesus Christ saved his son ? His new mission in life has been to expose the phoniness of exorcisms as well as to rescue victimized children . Hence this documentary.The first ten minutes of `` The Last Exorcism '' develop the Cotton Marcus character so well , he effectively draws the audience into a plot that , when viewed from a distance , is relentlessly absurd . This is the newest in a long line of faux documentaries compiled from `` recovered footage , '' which is to say that it 's by no means a groundbreaking horror film . Nevertheless , it 's thoroughly entertaining , and at times , it 's quite frightening . I only take issue with the film 's final five minutes , a scene so visually and structurally unoriginal that it surpasses routine and becomes an anticlimax . If there 's anything we 've learned from the good horror movies , it 's that certain things are better left to the imagination - to explain everything is to ruin the suspense . Had I been one of the producers , I would have fought tooth and nail for a reshoot of the ending.But I 'm getting way ahead of the story . Marcus , who 's constantly sent exorcism requests , responds to a letter from a man claiming that his teenage daughter is possessed . He travels to a remote farmhouse with his producer and cameraman , where they meet the Sweetzer family . The teenage son , Caleb ( Caleb Landry Jones ) , always seems to know more than he lets on , and is often highly intimidating . The father , Louis ( Louis Herthum ) , is devoutly religious , deeply troubled since the death of his wife , and alarmingly overprotective of his daughter , Nell ( Ashley Bell ) , who he believes is afflicted with a demon . How else to explain his slaughtered livestock and the blood that always appears on Nell 's clothing in the morning ? How else to explain the nights of endless screaming ? Marcus has seen and heard all this before . The sleepless nights , the dead animals , the blood - it 's a textbook case as far as he 's concerned . After meeting the nervous but nonetheless good natured Nell , he reveals to the camera his tricks for creating a convincing exorcism , including rigging a bedroom with fishing wire , hiding speakers in strategic places , and playing spooky sound effects at the push of a button . He then puts on a show , Nell and her father none the wiser . Marcus tells them that the demon has been exorcised . Father and daughter are relieved . Marcus and his crew leave , believing it to be another open and shut case . Things start going wrong , however , when Nell suddenly appears the crew 's motel room , her eyes glazed over , her actions highly provocative . How did she get there ? The motel is miles away from her home . Upon taking her to the hospital , Marcus stresses that what she really needs is a psychological examination , not more religious rhetoric.And from here , the film gets increasingly more conventional . Conventional and nauseating , the ever reliable Queasy Cam put to full use . Marcus and his team return to the farmhouse . Nell has periods of erratic , violent behavior , only to emerge from them unaware of what she had done . Disturbing drawings prove to have been prophetic , such as that of a white cat coated in blood and with X 's for eyes . Suspicions are aroused . Marcus finds it harder to play the part of an evangelical minister , for his real goal is to get Nell out of the house and into a psychiatric ward . Although shaken by the night 's unsettling events , he remains unconvinced Nell is genuinely possessed . I dare not reveal whether or not this is the case . `` The Last Exorcism '' would have been a much better film if it had done the same thing . Given the wonderful development of the Marcus character , given how frighteningly enjoyable most of the film is , it 's unfortunate that director Daniel Stamm opted for an ending that unsuccessfully goes for the obvious .	1
I loved this movie . And I even liked the ending . I see so many negative reviews on here of it and just could n't help it . I thought the acting , concept , everything ... was great . Try watching it alone in the dark .	1
I actually liked this movie . It had a well thought out plot & the effects were quite believable . I wish it had more special effects as far as the exorcism goes . This is a film worthy of watching again . If you have any interest in this particular genre , this flick 's for you . I 'm happy with this purchase	1
It was mostly a good movie . The documentary angle was well done ; you almost believed it . I wish they would stop trying to pass these movies off as true or based on a true story . Maybe so but based very loosely . Just let us enjoy getting the s*** scared out of us .	1
I thought this was a awesome movie suspenseful and definitely creepy . This movie has a great twist ending . It 's definitely one of the better horror movies I 've seen in a while .	1
I really got pulled in . I think the performances were well done . Some of the shots of scenery for atmosphere were amazing .	1
Ok I rented this movie to watch with my mom . By the end of the movie , we were both screaming `` What the f- '' this movie was very scary all the way to the end . This is why I give it four stars . Sadly the movie does not get the 5th star because of its ending . Very crappy to build up that much of a movie and then throw it down the drain with that kind of ending . I wont put any spoilers here , but I will say they could 've done a better ending but besides that , the movie was completley an A !	1
THE LAST EXORCISM is a `` mockumentary '' in the style of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT , chronicling the last exorcism performed by Preacher Cotton Marcus ( Patrick Fabian ) , a televangelist who has made himself famous by performing psychosuggestive exorcisms on credulous subjects . After reading of the death of a child by exorcism , the Preacher renounces his stage-managed performances and embraces medical science . During the course of the film he demonstrates his `` demonic '' sound-producing equipment and a battery operated smoking crucifix.Marcus brings a camera along to the home of his last `` possessed '' adherent , a young girl named Nell , who lives on an isolated farm with her hostile brother and gun-toting father . Farm animals have been found mutilated on the premises . The father is convinced that Nell has killed them . He wants to shoot Nell in order to stop any more evil from occurring , but Preacher Marcus convinces him to allow the exorcism . Although it initially seems to work , soon increasingly bizarre things begin occurring . Marcus is convinced that mental illness is to blame , but the Bible-intoxicated father insists on another round of exorcism.As the story progresses , the viewer is left to wonder if the father , the brother or the daughter is the perpetrator . The family seems severely dysfunctional , and Nell appears to be a victim . For the first half of the film , it is n't even clear whether this IS a documentary or not . As most of the cast is little-known , the film 's director maintains this fiction for a long while . It is only near the end that the question is answered.I did not expect to enjoy this film , but it was oddly compelling and quite convincing . The close of the film lacked the large payoff that seemed promised , but THE LAST EXORCISM is certainly worth seeing if you are a fan of the genre .	1
very scary movie in my opinion . the ending may kinda suck but it still will give you some scares . i suggest if you like the exorcist movies , get this	1
The movie is filmed in such a way it looks like the events are actually happening . Does n't `` look '' like a typical movie . The possession special effects look realistic . Ashley Bell , who played the girl did a convincing job of being possessed . The ending is a little strange , but overall a good horror movie- if you like possession/religious type horror .	1
If you like movies that follow the tradition of & # 34 ; The Exorcist & # 34 ; starring Linda Blair , you just might like this movie . Truly suspenseful and some unexpected turn of events . You probably should watch it with someone ! !	1
I 'll have to admit that I 'm surprised by the large number of negative reviews that there are for this movie . `` The Last Exorcism '' is actually quite good ! Looking through some of the more negative reviews , the ending is what seems to be bothering people ( which I am trying not to give away ) . However , this is a horror movie ! What kind of ending did people expect ? At one point , the viewer will be convinced that the possessed girl is just mentally ill . However , some pretty extreme things will occur that will lead you to question this ! This prompted one reviewer to write , `` Loved the idea of revealing the scam which is religion , but then they dropped the ball at the end . '' Really ? Why would anyone expect it to be any other way ? This is an exorcism movie ! If you go into this movie with an understanding of what you are watching , then you will not be disappointed . The acting is great , the documentary format is done convincingly , the horror elements are intense ( at least for a PG-13 film ) , and the storyline is far superior to many other exorcism movies that are out there .	1
A combination of The Blair Witch Project , The Exorcist , and Rosemary 's Baby , all in one movie ! Being an independent movie with unknown actors , adds more to an authentic feeling of realism.Not at all what I expected - Very original.I LOVE the Ending !	1
I have never seen a movie that original and well acted as this one . Since this movie Ashley Bell is one of my favorite actresses in the business ( she was also a stunner in The Day ) . The film was full of twists and turns and surprises and I found the ending a great hommage to another very interesting & # 34 ; documentary film & # 34 ; Cannibal Holocaust . Hopefully Eli Roth ( producer ) will keep things as interersting and original for the second part as he did in the first .	1
Paul Conroy is not a happy man . He has just woken up , bloodied , disoriented , and with a bad headache . And to cap it off & # 8230 ; he & # 8217 ; s been buried alive in a coffin . Now that & # 8217 ; s a really bad start to the week.Of course a cynic could reply that that & # 8217 ; s what you get for driving a truck for occupying forces in Iraq . And there & # 8217 ; s some truth in that . On the other hand , one can hardly blame Conroy for being sucked in for working for a firm that is so heartless and amoral it would make Satan blush . Regardless , this is not the time for doling out blame . Conroy has a cell phone to talk with his kidnappers and the outside world , a lighter , and only enough air to last the length of the film , the entirety of which is filmed inside the coffin.It is no small thing to film a powerful one and a half hour suspense solely with one actor in a coffin . ( Well in one sense it is a small thing but & # 8230 ; you know what I mean . ) Rodrigo Cortes does an outstanding job of directing and Ryan Reynolds does a bang on job playing the only character in the whole dang movie ( save those ghostly voices that float in with the cellphone , tantalizingly close and yet agonizingly far ) . This is one of the boldest , most original films I & # 8217 ; ve seen in years.As I sit and reflect on the experience I surmise that the most effective part of Buried is that it plays off our worst fears . The horror of being buried alive lies deep in our psyche ( think of Edgar Allen Poe & # 8217 ; s haunting short story & # 8221 ; The Cask of Amontillado & # 8221 ; ) . But the existential grip of this film doesn & # 8217 ; t stop there . The possibility of being buried alive , if terrifying , remains remote . The more horrifying recognition comes when we see that coffin as a metaphor for our very mortality . Whether we like it or not , each one of us is Paul Conroy , slowly waking up to our own inevitable demise and like him , desperately calling on the phone for somebody & # 8212 ; anybody & # 8212 ; who can help us.randalrauser.com	1
Ryan Reynolds really goes out of his norm to show enormous range of character . Indie director Rodrigo Cortes has given us a terrific commentary on social injustice , corporate ambivalence and one man 's last chance to validate his life . It 's not simplistic at all ; won the New York Critics ' Circle award for Best Screenplay . Not much to say without blabbing away all the clever jabs at life , as it might be . As a film , it 's certainly a revelation ; as satire , it 's brilliant , and as entertainment , I can only say that Ryan Reynolds is endearing and makes me care about his fate . I 'm especially pleased that the ending was n't a cop-out . Terrific premise , and very well done . Reynolds is a talent with which to be reckoned ... Tough role , well focused . My only objection is that the DVD I watched had no extras at all .	1
It was slow in places but the ending was totally worth it . I thought it was a pretty good movie .	1
This is quite a thriller with a great success story for an innocent victim . I certainly recommend this movie to others .	1
hm ... I must be very excitable because I could not understand how anybody could find this movie boring.We watched it on the `` edge of the seats '' , it was so gripping.The entire time the main character was just half step ahead of the pursuers , every moment threatening to be a disaster.Of course Crowe is a fantastic actor , which this movie just reminded us about , but we also found the script and the supporting actors very good.Watch it !	1
Let 's face it : in today 's Hollywood , far too many movies are produced to strictly be cash cows , `` popcorn flicks '' , or strictly vehicles for rising stars . While there is nothing wrong with that formula from a business point of view , it does serve to clutter/bog down the cinemas with largely irreverent fare . Fortunately , `` The Next Three Days '' is a shining example of how a film SHOULD be made.For a basic plot summary , this film focuses on the Brennan family . When wife Lara ( Elizabeth Banks ) is imprisoned for 20 years on a murder charge ( her guilt/innocence is unknown until later on in the movie ) , husband John ( Russell Crowe ) hatches a scheme to break her out and take their son Luke out of the country to start a new life together . Along the way , John Brennan gets advice from a former prison escapee ( Liam Neeson ) , must piece together a plan , and then finally decide if he deems himself capable of pulling it off.This movie will not immediately jump to the top of your `` all-time favorites '' list . What it will do , however , is entertain you for 2+ hours with intriguing characters , an interesting storyline , and enough plot twists to keep you guessing . It 's simple ( yet cognitive ) entertainment at its finest : sit back , immerse yourself , and stay along for the satisfying ride.Besides the immersive storyline , the acting is also an `` added bonus '' . Crowe and Banks are quite capable of carrying the leading roles , while Neeson , Olivia Wilde , Daniel Stern & even Brian Dennehy have excellent supporting roles , as small as they may be . Very much reminiscent of earlier Crowe films like `` The Insider '' & `` State of Play '' where the `` surround Crowe with auxiliary talent '' formula also paid off big.Thus , `` The Next Three Days '' is a very entertaining film ( though perhaps not an outright classic ) that I wish more Hollywood studios would copy . The acting is great , the plot is exciting , and the pacing is excellent . You 'll never be looking at the DVD timer to see how much is left , that is for sure .	1
I give this film four and a half stars . So many movies get good reviews but i am alwyas about 95 % what other people think after 50 or more reviews . If you watch this film you will enjoy it . its super suspensful	1
This is a film unlike many others in which the jail breakout is for the wife/mother of the main protagonist . Russell Crowe speaks with a voice that does more then rumble up from the pit of his stomach , but comes further down , most likely from his toe nails . The planning that he utilized was excellent without resorting to shooting their way out . He even included his son in the planning that normally would have complicated his plan beyond believability/possibility.A story in which the judicial system utterly failed the convicted wife ( I did not reference it as the justice system ) . Not only was the story sufficiently different to not be either a sequel , or one in which much of the story was copied , cut and pasted from other sources into a screen story.The cinematography and audio met the high standards that we expect from US movies without giving it a second thought.I would highly recommend it as a film that brings in a different perspective .	1
`` The Next Three Days '' is a tight , hard-hitting thriller that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film . I really did n't know , right up to the final moments , how it would end - and because the film had expertly guided me to care about all the characters , even some random losers in a meth lab , I did care about how it would end . The actors are all good with Russell Crowe especially so , and the realistically gritty sets perfectly match the film 's desperate tone . Elizabeth Banks ' too-good-to-be-true wholesome , sunny good looks are well used . `` The Next Three Days '' reminded me of Hitchcock , and of 1993 's `` The Fugitive , '' but it does n't rise to that level of classic . Rather , it 's a well-oiled machine , designed efficiently to crank out the audience 's engagement , tension and release.There are a couple of especially good moments . The opening scene could have been satisfactory if all it did was to set the stage for what is to follow , but it does so much more . I 'd love to watch that scene again ( and again ) . A women with a plunging neckline spars with Lara , a more modestly dressed woman , about whether or not women can ever get over their competition over men and bond with each other . The scene demonstrates its contents : Ms. D & eacute ; colletage uses double entendres to make a pass at Lara 's husband , and Lara shows the audience she is quite capable of losing her temper , an important plot point . The brilliant writing in this scene is a bonus . There is a scene involving a sewer drain that economically resolves a question the audience has had for some time . A scene with a car door is similarly powerful and informative . Brian Dennehy 's performance as an intimacy-impaired , working class dad is almost wordless and quite brilliant . And the film really does bring poignancy to the scum of the earth , drug dealers .	1
This movie is awesome . He really goes all out for his women . He pulls off some Jason Bourne type stuff .	1
Excellent - very well written . I could watch this again and see even more . The character development is good , the plot believeable and the acting was supberb .	1
First let me say , my wife very commonly falls asleep in the evening as we watch a movie . That did n't happen on this film . It was captivating and not predictable . Well worth the watch .	1
I 'm a big Russell Crowe fan and this movie doesnt let you down . It 's like beautiful mind meets the TV series prison break . A movie with a lot of internal struggle for the lead actor and they couldnt have picked a better actor to play that roll IMO . The biggest upset in the movie is when Russel Crowe uses a tennis ball to open a car door . Major fail on that , but the rest of the movie is entertaining and a worthy watch .	1
Excellent movie , I leave it to others to tell you the plot . I was impressed by the husband , a school teacher who shows extraordinary cunning , ingenuity and presence of mindin each phase of the tale . He makes one stupid mistake trying a & # 34 ; bump & # 34 ; key in theprison before practicing in safer surroundings . Bagging the garbage with the wallmaps and plans with misleading clues was brilliant , as was giving the two seniorsa lift to beguile the police at the toll gate . I was left a little puzzled by the ease withwhich they took possession of the white getaway car , as though it was left there , openwith the key in the ignition . My parting thought that I think many will share after seeingthis movie is .. , was this a happy ending ?	1
The Next Three Days is easily one of the most powerful films I 've ever seen . The acting is stellar ; there is significant character development and there 's suspense , mystery , action and many poignant moments . The film also benefits from solid choreography and cinematography ; and the musical score is very well done . True , some may say that the beginning starts off a little slow ; but I think it sets the stage for character development and in that case it 's worth it . The plot also has numerous unexpected plot twists and turns as others have noted ; just when you think something is about to happen something else might happen instead ! That 's a fine quality about this film.When the action ( and there 's quite a bit of action at that ) starts , we meet John and Lara Brennan ( Russell Crowe and Elizabeth Banks ) who are having dinner with John 's brother Mick and sister-in-law Erit ( Michael Buie and Moran Atias ) . We also see just how happy and gratified John and Lara are with their lives : they are very much in love with one another and they adore their beautiful three year old son , Luke ( Tyler Green ) . Suddenly one morning , however , the police and many detectives barge in and arrest Lara for the murder of her boss ; Lara is convicted of this murder even though she says she did n't do it . But they have the evidence : people at work saw Lara fighting many times with her boss ; Lara 's fingerprints are at the scene of the crime ; and her boss 's blood stain is on her coat.Three years pass as John faithfully makes his trips to the prison , sometimes with their now six year old son Luke ( who is now played by Ty Simpkins ) . John is greatly pained at Lara 's emotional deterioration ; she tries to kill herself after all legal appeals have failed and she even angrily tells John that she did commit the murder ! John , however , does n't believe Lara did it , not even for a moment.John realizes that he ca n't be without Lara : she is being transferred to another correctional facility far away and her mental health is only getting worse and worse . In a frenzy John makes a three day plan to get Lara out of prison at any price -- he is going to free Lara but he does n't tell her for fear that she might try to stop him.Of course , there is much more for you to enjoy watching this film . Did Lara really kill her boss or is that confession to John a symptom of her mental illness ? How will John get Lara out ; and who will help him make his plans -- if anyone ? Watch and find out ! In addition , look for excellent but all too brief cameos by Liam Neeson as Damon Pennington , a man who escaped from prison seven times and even wrote a tell-all book about it ; Olivia Wilde as Nicole , a mother of one of Ty 's friends ; Brian Dennehy as John 's father George and Aisha Hinds does a great job of playing Detective Collero . RZA also has a cameo playing `` Mouss . `` I understand that there was at least one Q & A ; session with the cast and crew after this movie was released ; I would have loved to see this as an extra on the DVD but it is not found here.In short , The Next Three Days is jam-packed with suspense , mystery , pathos and action . I highly recommend this film for any fan of the actors in it ; and anyone who enjoys this genre of film will love this motion picture .	1
My husband and I both enjoyed this movie . Suspense , twists and turns . You get involved . Worth the bowl of popcorn !	1
The actors are on top of their game so the movie moves along smooth with a good mix of suspense and action . I liked the central crisis of how the government can crush a single human being at will even when the person is innocent . So what can a single individual who has always been law abiding do about it ? Watch the movie and see a possible outcome . It is worth the watch .	1
FILM RATING : 3.5 starsTo my surprise , Russell Crowe 's latest film , The Next Three Days ( 2010 ) , was a better than expected action/suspense `` heist/caper '' film . The trailer , and many critical reviews I 've read , do n't do it justice . But writer/director Paul Haggis came through here in my opinion with a gripping drama that starts slow , but builds the stakes to a good climax . It definitely reminded me of the now classic Harrison Ford vehicle , The Fugitive ( 1993 ) . But it was a fresh twist on an old concept . It even has a bit of Enemy of the State ( 1998 ) and director Tony Scott 's iconic style mixed in for good measure.The concept of The Next Three Days is pretty simple . It 's a story about a family of three who are living the idyllic modern suburban lifestyle . Elizabeth Banks plays the mother , and seemingly the breadwinner , in the family . One morning , their calm house is stormed by the police and Banks ' character is arrested and charged with murder of her female boss at work . The story pretty much jumps forward three years to where Banks is locked up in jail for life after being found guilty in court . Her husband , played by Russell Crowe , does n't believe she 's guilty for a minute , but they could never find evidence of her innocence or the actual killer to take the blame for the crime . Banks ' character ca n't seem to deal with the loss of her life and attempts suicide , adding to the pressure that Crowe and their son already feel from their fractured family . So Crowe decides he has to break Banks out of jail . And he finds out exactly what thats going to take from ex-convict Liam Neeson . The rest of the plot goes where you are probably guessing it goes . So I 'll let the film fill in the rest.I will say that some of the `` extraordinary '' ( or coincidental ) circumstances and events within the story make one suspend belief in order to really enjoy the film . Usually these kind of unrealistic and overly `` lucky '' sequence of events take me out of a film to a degree . But somehow , Haggis and Crowe and the rest of the cast and filmmakers pulled it off with this one . I can see how some film critics and viewers of the film might not let the far fetched conceits of the film work for them . But as I 've written before , movies by definition are creating a `` fantastical '' world in which they exist . Every sci-fi or alien movie requires one to suspend belief to some degree . And just because The Next Three Days does n't live in one of those genres , does n't mean that it ca n't ask you to suspend your sense of realism . Enough said ! There 's no doubt in my mind that one of the key aspects of the success of The Next Three Days is Russell Crowe 's performance . He plays a middle-aged , slightly overweight , married father quite well . And yet he also transforms during the course of the movie into a badass criminal . All at the same time he remains a caring father and loving husband . And I think it 's that process of personal transformation with his character that makes the film interesting . The first hour of the film is a little too slow in that process maybe , but it does really build-up to the engaging third act of the movie . I think maybe the writing and editing could have been a little tighter to keep the movie moving along more . But after listening to an Apple `` Meet The Filmmaker '' podcast with director Paul Haggis defending his purposely slow build-up in the first half of the film , I can also buy into that philosophy . But I think if the film did have a little faster pace to it , it would elevate the film to higher level at least in my eyes . Nonetheless , this is a successful film and it works.The production values in The Next Three Days are really solid like so many films today . The cinematography from St & eacute ; phane Fontaine is good , but nothing I have n't seen before . The production design by Laurence Bennett is also well done and gives us very realistic sets and locations for the story to take place in . Sound Editing led by Renee Tondelli is really well executed with a full array of surround sounds we all expect now in an action film of this type . And I was very impressed with Danny Elfman 's music . He continues to shine and gives this film a better score than one like this typically gets . And I do think that is part of what helps elevate The Next Three Days above its peers like Unstoppable ( 2010 ) .I missed seeing The Next Three Days in the theater last year , but it was a nice surprise seeing it in HD recently . I continue to be amazed at how much better many movies look at home on blu-ray or in HD than they do in the theater . The theaters really need to invest in modern digital projection technology and bring back the aura of the cineplex . While I ca n't make the direct comparison here , my intuition tells me that I did n't miss anything in this film 's theatrical presentation . And I could n't have asked for a better home theater presentation . The high definition mastering of this film is about as good as it gets . So give your living room an aural shake-up with The Next Three Days .	1
This movie has a fascinating plot and great acting . The plot keeps the viewer attached to the movie from beginning to end .	1
Loved the movie and Russell Crowe . Lots of action and great cinematography . Well worth owning on blu ray which made the action sequences much better than ordinary DVD .	1
Perfect ... fast shipping ... . good movie	1
You can only love and enjoy this movie ... though it has a sad part..it leaves you in love with this move and Zac Efron !	1

A young man loses his younger brother in A car crash , after that he claims he can see his ghost , at first it does n't make any sense until near the end when he helps someone else from dying .	1
this movie is and was an always must buy because of how zac efron is such a good actor and how this movie always left me with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes ...	1
So poignant and so sad and yet allows one to believe that there is life after death and yet again a time to say good-bye ... grief and pain , laced with guilt that means you ca n't allow yourself to let go and move forward and then one day , something happens and the present becomes so important that the loving from the past allows one to take the chance to have a new happiness and that is what Charlie St . Cloud had to do to make himself a part of the present and the future and say good-bye to his sad and accidental past . Beautiful story and well acted by everyone in the film .	1
I have just watched this DVD and I found it very interesting on many levels . However I do realise that it was meant for a younger audience and now I am going to forward it to my teenage godson who has just fallen in love for the first time as I am sure that he will enjoy it much more than I.All the actors in the movie are very charismatic ( I was surprised to see Ray Liota acting a nice part in it , as he always portrays a baddie , and it must be a nice change for him this time ) . On the whole it is a pleasing movie with a moral to the story which I wont reveal for all those that intend to purchase this movie , but again I will state , that it is mainly for the young at heart or for the young in love , and viewers will not be disappointed in any way for purchasing Mr. Charlie St.Cloud and Zac Efron is very easy on the eyes as well , as any teenager will tell you.Sophia	1
I have to say I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this movie . I did n't what to expect considering the main star of the movie . The movie started a little slow , but once it took off I really enjoyed it . Charlie St Cloud is based on an acclaimed novel and follows a young man named Charlie St . Cloud ( Zac Efron ) . Charlie survives an accident and now he is able to see his little brother ( Sam ) who did not survive the accident . Sam and Charlie make a promise to meet each other everyday at a certain time , but when Charlie meets a girl it forces him to decide to live in the world he has discovered with his brother or his new found love . I will not give away the ending , but I will say it was a pleasant unexpected one . The blu-ray of Charlie St Cloud looks picture perfect in 1080p and the DTS-HD MA 5.1 sound is perfect.Bonus features belowDeleted ScenesOn location with Zac Efron : Come along for a ride in Vancouver , with Zac Efron as he takes on his first major dramatic leading role in Charlie St .

I just watched this movie and I loved it ! Do n't want to spoil anything about what happens or the twists in this movie ... .I would just say WATCH IT !	1
Look , this is simply an enjoyable movie with a standard theme ( `` boy meets girl/boy saves girl '' ) , nice looking kids and an age old plot . But it is filmed in a beautiful setting , with acting good enough to allow you to escape for a couple of hours . For that , I give it top marks !	1

I luv Zac Efron and this is a great movie.. I consider him a excellent actor and this movie has all of his charm . It is a sad but happy ending type of movie . enjoy..	1
This is a beautifully filmed biopic of the steamy affair between Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky . As depicted in the film , when the controversial `` Rite of Spring '' was first produced by the Ballets Russes in 1913 , Chanel was one of the few in the audience who was deeply impressed by the composer 's genius . From that event , she thereafter invites Igor Stravinsky to be a quasi-permanent guest at her villa in the country ; it is there she seduces the maestro.I wanted to like the picture more than I did . Certainly the music of the `` Rite of Spring '' - which holds the picture together - is intrinsically thrilling and dramatic . The glimpse of the ballet as it may have been initially produced is intriguing . ( For the full ballet , I do recommend the recently released : `` Stravinsky and the Ballets Russes '' on DVD . ) But ultimately the story does not explain how the affair impacted either Stravinsky 's or Chanel 's individual creative projects . And the affair itself does not light up the screen - it is almost lukewarm.The quote I picked for the title of this review is the line that shocked me in the film - when Stravinsky quips at Coco Chanel ... and wrongfully at that . Everyone in fashion understands how much of a genius and artist Chanel was . Indeed the gorgeous villa that Chanel decorated is explicitly shown in the movie . It clearly exhibits the bold , simplistic , immeasurably compelling talent of Chanel . The film - which I said earlier is beautifully shot - shows the performance in the Opera House in the Champs-Elysee . It also uses historic costumes from the real Chanel collections.A theme in the latter half of the picture is the impact of the love affair on the neglected wife of Stravinsky who was dangerously ill ; the wife 's accusations of immorality against Coco Chanel do not phase the couturier . After all , Chanel apologizes to no one for her independence.Nonetheless , my favorite Chanel movie remains the documentary - `` Chanel , Chanel . '' And as fictional drama , I actually did prefer `` Coco Before Chanel '' , a movie most highly recommended by Roger Ebert . But Chanel enthusiasts wil see `` Coco Chanel and Igor Stravnisky '' ... definitely .	1
Alan Resnais is probably the last survivor and shares with Erich Romer the honor of being the most intellectual filmmakers of the extinct French New Wave . ( Hiroshima mon amour and The last year in Mariembad talk by themselves ) But Resnais surprised us with this smart script about the encounter of two beings through a random fact . A woman is unexpectedly assaulted after shopping . And when an introspective man finds her wallet ( with all her documentation and brings it back to police , a web of mutual intends for establishing contact will pave the way for a film in which the ontological loneliness of both beings will emerge , although the levels of intensity between both of them exchange roles.A sumptuous photography of nocturnal Paris , a magnificent direction , the marvelous takes all the way through , an engaging illumination and a tour de force performances by all cast make of this witty film a must-have for all of them who -like me- expect and applause the role of author-cinema .	1
Robert Duvall is a man 's man . Always has and always will be . He 'll make a movie and if you do n't like it ... so what.But none of his movies have been `` so whats '' in my mind.Especially `` Get Low '' . This shows another side of Duvall and it 's dark , humerous and guilty.But for the guilt ... it 's time for it to go.I love this man and his attitude .	1
this has to be oneof robert duvalls best movie yet.this is a great film robert duvall delervers a memorable character . bill murray is also great in this film . this movie is outstanding . if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do	1
I had a good time at my dad 's memorial service . I know that might sound strange , but most people there enjoyed the service . There were good stories , laughter and plenty of food afterward . It was a party . Really , the only thing missing was my Dad . I wish he could have been there.In recently released film , `` Get Low '' , the character Felix Bush ( Robert Duvall ) wants to attend his own funeral . He wants to throw a `` funeral party . '' He says he wants to give people an opportunity to tell their stories about him . But Bush does not expect the stories to be humorous or heartwarming . He has lived for forty years as a hermit with a reputation as a violent lunatic.Bush first goes to the local pastor and asks if he can buy himself a funeral , but the pastor ( Gerald McRaney ) astutely observes that Bush is trying to buy forgiveness . He tells Bush that forgiveness can not be purchased but is a free gift of God . We must confess our sin and receive the free gift through Christ 's sacrifice . Bush leaves and finds a funeral home director ( Bill Murray ) who is more than happy to take his money for a `` funeral party '' .As the film follows the preparations for the funeral , we begin to learn more of Bush 's story in bits and pieces . We learn about his sin and his ultimate failure to atone for it on his own , but forgiveness and restoration is found . `` Get Low '' is based on a true story , set in Tennessee of the 1930 's . Told at a leisurely pace , the story does not offer summer distractions of CGI effects and explosions ( okay , there is a fire at the beginning of the film ) , but it does offer its own pleasures.Bill Murray offers his dry wit within a character of that time and place . Murray has been funny for over thirty years now , while many other comedians have worn out their welcome.In fact , one of the real joys of the film is seeing old faces . Hollywood has always celebrated youth and `` physical perfection '' . But there is a special pleasure in seeing the aged faces of Duvall and Sissy Spacek . Celebrated actors when they were making films decades ago in classics like `` The Godfather '' and `` Apocalypse Now '' , `` Carrie '' and `` Coal Miner 's Daughter '' respectively , neither was known primarily for looks . But now there is a definite pleasure in seeing the lines and spots of age in faces of such fully lived lives . `` Get Low '' can be seen as the third film in Duvall 's faith trilogy , the first two being `` Tender Mercies '' and `` The Apostle '' . `` Tender Mercies '' won Duvall the Oscar for Best Actor and earned another Oscar for screen writer Horton Foote . ( It is probably not a coincidence that Gerald McRaney 's character in `` Get Low '' is Pastor Horton . ) `` Tender Mercies '' features one of the most realistic and moving depictions of a man 's gradual conversion to Christianity in any film . `` The Apostle '' was written and directed by Duvall himself . There is no shortage in American media of depictions of clergy who fall into sin and hypocrisy . But this film does so with even more powerful depictions of God 's love and grace.Each of these films is like a true Christian funeral . There is pain and tears , but joy and hope overcome .	1
I enjoyed this movie because it had everything ! The idea of someone attending their own funeral ? Great ! Andthe sad story behind why he had to have this big funeral finale ! Bill Murray was great as always .	1
I loved the sound track but the story is the star here . Based on a true story Robert Duval , Sissy Spacek , Bill Murry and Lucas Black come together to pull off this tale in a believable way . This is a gem I will watch many times and enjoy !	1
Based on the true story of a Tennessee recluse who staged his own funeral in 1938 is where our tall tale begins . Felix Bush ( Robert Duvall ) a once strong , free-spirited , and crafty man has exiled himself in the woods for four decades living with a terrible secret . Despite his advanced age the local townspeople hate , and fear this old stranger who lives in seclusion . After hearing of the death of an old friend , Felix decides to orchestrate a mock funeral in order to finally publicly confess , and atone for his mortal sin . He is helped in this endeavor by undertaker Frank Quinn ( Bill Murray ) and his warm newly married assistant Buddy ( Lucas Black ) . Frank Quinn a slick salesman and opportunist from Chicago will have no compunctions about setting up this bizarre funeral party despite its moral ambiguity . And so our bittersweet drama begins with Duvall 's wonderfully strong stoic performance contrasted by Murray 's blistering deadpan gestures , and remarks concerning the whole matter . It 's their counterpointing characters like Godzilla meets King Kong that saves this movie from being too preachy , and redemptive . Thankfully it is neither but rather a good tender hearted story , well paced with great acting . Later we are introduced to two wonderful people from Felix 's past , recent widow Mattie Darrow ( Sissy Spacek ) , and the wise old Rev.Charlie Jackson ( Bill Cobbs ) who is the only other person alive who knows the secrets of Felix Bush . Its a funeral party you wo n't want to miss ...	1
This is a good but not outstanding movie . Robert Duvall is a great actor who did a good job in this movie . It is worth watching but not a must see picture .	1
Some Amazonians have criticized I Am Love as melodramatic , stilted or a costume drama , complaining about a lack of realism . I wonder how they can square that against , say , various Shakespeare classics or musicals or cartoons , even . I can assure each reviewer that just outside the boundaries of the viewer 's screen are about one hundred grips , techs and A/V workers . Unlike music , film is intrinsically a medium of artifice . Everyone you see is pretending ( or `` acting '' if you will ) .I found the film 's direction to be expressive but varying . During the middle third , the seduction parts , Guadagnino loses focus ( literally ) just as Emma does and he abstains from the Steadicam , just as Emma does , I guess . During the final part there are some incredible set pieces : cutting during the ukha dinner scene that rivals Hitchcock and a riveting confrontation between Emma and Edo by the pool where they speak Russian for the first time . Knock-out scene.In the climactic scene , Emma prepares to depart the family home for her lover , Antonio , and seeks assent from her daughter Betta . Betta ( `` now we have more money '' ) leads a carefree lesbian life in London and is a puzzling choice to absolve Emma of her wedding vows . In the end , we find Emma in a dark cave with Antonio , unaware that Edo 's child grows within Eva and excommunicated ( `` you do n't exist '' ) from her family . No good future awaits her .	1
This is a different film where the language is much less important ( in fact quite sparse ) than the esthetics of the visual impressions . It starts quite slow and the pace of the storytelling intensify until it ends in real crescendo , both the plot , the music and visually . It is dealing with passion and troublesome relationships.In a way the film has biblical proportions . I saw it at the cinema and I think this is a film that is at its best here . No one in the audience even drew their breath at the end - it was complete silence for a good long time when the rolling titles came on . The music was also wonderful and so well adapted to the plot.Different in a good way - watch it !	1
FUNNY , FUNNY , AND SOME TIMES A LITTLE BIT OF DRAMA.THIS TV SHOW WAS MADE DURING THE 80 's AND AFTERALL OF THESE YEARS ... . THE SHOW STILL MAKES ME LAUGH.GET IT , AND YOU WILL ENJOY IT TOO ...	1

Actually , he wears them pretty much the entire movie . This tongue-in-cheek homage to the masked luchador movies of the 60 's and 70 's is a real hoot . Mil Mascaras , who starred and co-starred in many of those films , is back , playing - who else ? Mil Mascaras ! Scholar , scientist , composer , and grappler extraordinaire , he 's a man of many talents . Women want him - men want to be him . And oh yeah . In this film , he also saves the world with his wrestling skills.Boasting an English speaking cast ( though boasting is a pretty strong word considering the quality of some of the acting , but therein lies much of the film 's charm ) , pretty good production values , and some of the most laughable dialogue I 've heard in a long time ( example uttered by one of the main characters after Mascaras leaves the room : `` Mil Mascaras ... What a guy ! `` ) , Mil Mascaras Vs. the Aztec Mummy is a lucha lover 's dream come true . Mascaras , still in phenomenal shape for a man in his mid-sixties , carries this film on his shoulders as he would an opponent in an airplane spin . The titular Aztec Mummy , whose evil plans and powerful scepter make the threat of nuclear war pale in comparison , proves to be a worthy adversary , even though he ca n't move his mouth . It 's up to The Man of a Thousand Masks to rescue mankind from the fate in store for it . In between the all-important wrestling matches , of course.This movie offered at least as many laughs as the many masks for which Mascaras is famous . One of my favorite bits came following a publicity photo shoot ( another all-important event taking place while the earth trembles ) Mascaras does with twin girl models . The twins approach and come on to him , inviting him back to their place . Slightly shocked , the ever-virtuous Mascaras politely declines their invitation . But when the girls confess their attraction for one another , the Man of a Thousand Masks is suddenly in ! Yeah baby , yeah ! Of course , things quickly go south from there , but for a moment , I believe Mil Mascaras was getting his kink on ! This movie has to be seen to be believed , and I recommend it most highly to fans of the genre . Is it really a five star movie ? Probably not . But for the moment at least , I 'm allowing my rating to stand as is because , quite frankly , this is the most fun I 've had with a film in quite a few months . Admittedly , I was a bit hesitant to order it as it is a fairly expensive DVD , but just the laughs I got out of it are worth probably ten times what I paid.I do have one question . Does anyone know when Mascaras ' follow-up movie to this - The Academy of Doom - is going to be released on DVD ? It 's several years old now , and so far as I know , has never seen the light of day . If it 's anywhere near as good as Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy , I would buy it in a heartbeat . Heck I 'd buy it anyway . This is great stuff !	1
Amanda King is just a house wife juggling day to day activities when Leestetson recruites her for spy activity in Washington DC.Familyfun with light violence .	1
I love Scarecrow and Mrs. King . I 've ordered Seasons 1 and 2 but want Amazon to order the remaining seasons . Also , I have seasons 1 and 2 of Hart To Hart and would really like Amazon to order the remaining seasons .	1
Good show ! Like the concept , like the actors and who they play , like the humor , yet it keeps some of the innocence of the show .	1
The Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a wonderful mix of action , adventure , mystery , comedy , and romance.In the first season of the show , Lee Stetson , a secret agent codenamed `` Scarecrow '' working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the `` Agency '' finds himself in a tough spot and is forced to ask a civilian , Mrs. King , to deliver a package for him . Although Amanda King , divorced mother of two boys , is unable to deliver the package as Lee asked , she ends up helping him to solve the case he 's working on and joins the Agency herself . She becomes Lee 's friend and partner , and later , the two of them fall in love . Amanda offers Lee a unique point-of-view on things because she understands more about ordinary civilian life than the regular agents do . At times , the series might seem a little corny because of the way a group of trained secret agents comes to rely on an ordinary suburban housewife , but it 's all in fun . Personally , I find the shows hilarious , with the clashes between Mrs. King 's nave yet practical approach to situations and Scarecrow 's professional experience , particularly since Mrs. King has to go to great lengths to keep her family from finding out that she has become a spy.Most of the shows take place around Washington D.C. and Virginia , but this season features some episodes which take place in other countries . The episodes in season 2 are:1 . To Catch a Mongoose - Lee and Amanda are in London on the trail of an assassin who might be an old classmate of Amanda's.2 .

Ship of Spies - Lee asks Amanda to come on a cruise to help him investigate the disappearance of a friend of his on that same cruise ship . The only problem is that the current cruise is for couples who are about to be married , and if they do n't solve the case in time , they may have to go through with the ceremony to avoid blowing their cover.13 . Spiderweb - Lee is forced to spy on Amanda when someone makes it look like she is leaking information about defectors that the Agency is trying to protect.14 .

Scarecrow and Mrs. King is fun for the whole family ! I did n't watch much television when this show originally aired , so when I saw this recently it was for the first time . It is such a fun show with a good pace and nice comedic and romantic timing . The characters are well developed and the core group of actors on the show is really solid . A well done show that deserves to have an audience with the DVD crowd . Please get seasons 2-4 on DVD asap ! I 'm not sure what is the hold up , but please , please , please fix it . The world wants its Kate Jackson , Bruce B. and Mel Stewart ! Thanks ! ! ! ! :0 )	1
Overall I love Scarecrow and Mrs King . This show is no different . With the exception that I had to with this and nearly every episode , refresh the page during the program because it froze up on me more than once . Love the program not so crazy about the connection .	1
I could watch these shows every day ! This is one of my favorite seasons because Scarecrow and Mrs. King are getting closer and enjoying being together more . They are learning about each other and finding out that they really work well as a team ! Ca n't wait for Season 4 .	1
The Scarecrow and Mrs. King is a wonderful mix of action , adventure , mystery , comedy , and romance.In the first season of the show , Lee Stetson , a secret agent codenamed `` Scarecrow '' working for an organization in the Washington D.C. area known only as the `` Agency '' finds himself in a tough spot and is forced to ask a civilian , Mrs. King , to deliver a package for him .

''	1
Could n't wait for this to get here and I was n't disappointed . Love It and I really ca n't wait to order some more of my favorite old shows .	1
One good series . These two make a good pair . What is not to like about Kate Jackson . She plays well off Bruce B .	1
I love the chemistry between lee and amanda . It is so funny how she gets into certain situations . All in all this was a great series .	1
I love Scarecrow and Mrs King season four ! ! ! ! It 's fantastic ! Getting married ... Mrs King becomes Mrs Scarecrow ... Love always ...	1
This is a series that I could let my grand children watch with out being ashamed of it 's content . It was funny and could get ya thinking .	1
I have always been a fan of Scarecrow and Mrs King , and now my set is complete . It 's nice to be able to just sit and enjoy the chemistry between these 2 . It is also fun to compare the situations and styles of then to the way things are now .	1
This video has not been remastered . Still good quality though . I enjoyed the show when it aired and it is fun to revisit . Technology has advanced and obviously dated the show . However , it is pleasant to watch a good show without today 's added ( and unnecessary ) profanity , sex , political and social agendas .	1
We are so excited for this season to be released on DVD . We own season one and will buy the subsequent seasons as soon as they are released . A really fun series ! We LOVE Kate Jackson !	1
i liked it alot alot.i remenber watching this tv show when i was a kid . i think this is a show to watch .	1
This final season was a lot of fun to watch . It is fun to have a series from my earlier years when television was just for entertainment !	1
I now have all 4 seasons . Wish it was still on . Loved the relationship that developed between Lee and Amanda . The only way I get to continue the show now is through the DVDs and the fanfiction writers .	1
We have been looking forward to this last arrival and started watching as soon as it arrived ! The fun and adventure Scarecrow and Mrs. King have keeps you coming back again and again ! The last few episodes are kind of sad . I think it 's when Kate Jackson got sick and was n't in the episodes very much . We have a tendency to watch all the episodes but stop after & # 34 ; Do You Take This Spy ? & # 34 ; Hope you enjoy as much as we do !	1
As someone who watched `` thirtysomething '' beginning with the first episode in 1987 ; I was thrilled to find the series available on Instant Videos . This episode was taken from the last season ; and is the follow up to `` Second Look '' there is a distinct feeling of winding down , and the tying of loose ends with Gary 's funeral . But I found that even after all these years it can still tug at the heart strings . I highly recommend it for anyone who loved the show in its first run ; or for those just discovering one of the better dramas produced for television .	1
By this time , you should have an idea of the format of this thing , Castle mystery writer , has the hots for Beckett , but for whatever reason seems incapable of articulating that.Front story , the murders are decent , if a bit formulaic ; like a bad poker player , they telegraph the killer in a lot of instances , so it becomes more of & # 34 ; Okay I know who likely did the dirty deed , now how exactly do they tie into the crime itself ? & # 34 ; Instead of trying to figure out who actually did the crime.There are a few episodes that are just okay ; They progress the plot and little else.The back stories ... .well , there 's a bit of overacting but for the most part there 's a goodly amount of interaction and humor done by some excellent actors.But there are other episodes that are quite entertaining and worth viewing more than once.At this point this series is my go-to for entertaining episodesHighly recommended	1
I love this show , so this is perfect ! I would recommend this show to any one who likes this type of show	1
love watching series on DVD so I do n't have to put up with the commercials . This is one of the best ones	1
am catching up with castle , and find it entertaining and fun to watch and to see what happens in the future	1
Castle Season is very funny , romantic and action packed . I particularly liked episode 9 , `` Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind '' as Castle made reference to his former character on the shows Serenity and Firefly . Becket asks why he knows Chinese and he says it 's from a show he learned it from a show he use to like . If you are not familiar with his previous work it wo n't be funny . I love the interaction between Becket and Castle . This is an excellent show . Can you have a light hearted murder ? Absolutely ! I enjoy the interaction between Castle and his mother and daughter as well . Castle 's mother wears great clothing and jewelry . If you like fashion this show is for you as it 's also very stylish .	1
I like shopping at Amazon in the comfort of my home . You all seem to have all things in stock and ready to be delievered -ON TIME ! ! ! ! ! Thanks for the smiles through the years . L.S .	1
I just started watching Castle and found I had been missing something great ! It 's fun and makes you think at the sametime .	1
As I stated in the 2nd season review this show is addicting . After being glued to my tv & or my computer watching episode after episode I was indeed addicted . I then loaned the cds to my granddaughter and her husband and they are now addicted . Continual action , wondering what will happen next with both Castle 's home life which includes his wacky Mom & fun loving daughter you will be laughing and wondering all at the same time .	1
explained thoroughly on all seasons , gets better and better and better and funnier ... ..I bought each season of course I love the show .	1
i saw this show for the first time a couple of months ago . it is so witty . the detective cases are interesting and sometimes , well most of the time , bizarre . it is fun trying to figure out who is the real murderer . the actors seem to have a good time with each other and the burgeoning romance is fun to watch , right from the first episode .	1
Video was ordered on my new kindle . Great color and audio on the video . I would have thought I was watching a movie if it was n't on such a small scale .	1
Castle has the perfect blend of humor , action , mystery , sexual tension , plot twists , and interesting characters . The chemistry between Richard Castle and Kate Beckett would keep me tuning in every week even if I did not love the rest of it so much , but I do . With so many mediocre shows on TV these days , this one is the bright star . Castle has found its perfect formula and has not tried to mess it up as so many sitcoms do . One of the most entertaining and memorable shows in years , it 's always a bit of rascally fun thanks to Castle 's irrepressible sense of humor .	1
what can i say , castle is castle . loved it . words can not describe the addiction that i have for this ongoing series .	1
One of the best seasons , hated to see the Captain go . I 'd already seen season 4 so I know how it picks up from here , but I remember thinking that I do n't like it when they leaving us hanging for the summer .	1
We have gotten every season as it comes out . Even though we have seen it the first time on TV , it is just as entertaining . We have shared them with friends and bought them for family .	1
Really entertaining with the family and Beckett things going on . Every show has been very entertaining with really unique story lines	1
Clean humor even when suggestive and the language not used makes this a great family show for all ages . Characters are real and likeable plus given room to expand .	1
AS I WROTE IN ; MY OTHER COMMENT LISTING I LOVE THE SERIES AND WATCH IT EVERY ; TIME IT IS ON CABOLE AND WAIT TO SEE WHERE THE STORY LINE WILL GO AND THE ROMANCVE BETWEEN CASTLE 7 BECKETT .	1
I love this show , the cast of characters are perfect . This is a very good show . I look forward to it weekly	1
what is there not to like about this DVD.. Castle is such a great show and love to watch them over and over	1
The third season is the best so far of this series . I 'm hooked on this series and will continue as an avid fan .	1
This series just gets better and better . The characters are getting deeper , the plots even more involved . Do n't blink or you 'll miss something	1
Love the love story in Castle and the cases are great . Of course , I crush on any character that Nathan does .	1
TV feels inundated with sitcoms , but Modern Family manages to rise about most of the crowd with its interesting characters and unique brand of humor . From the opening episode I was hooked , with each of the three families being followed offering a different 'feel ' but each being equally funny . The show follows a format of three separate storylines in most episodes , which it usually manages to tie together in the end with some kind of unified theme . It is an interesting format , and the writers have really made it work.Season 2 is well worth checking out if you were a fan of the previous season . The families manage to grow and adapt just enough to keep their characters interesting , but without hurting the original formula that makes the show work .	1
This show just got better and it 's the last season of the original Lilly . The stone faced adorable baby that never showed emotion or said a thing . Loved it lol	1
I purchased this series for $ 8.99 from amazon.com during the Black Friday deals week . It includes the entire second season and a few extras ( though not many ) .The case is slim , and the discs all stay put pretty well . I 'm happy with the quality of packaging . Now onto the show.I watched the second season originally from the local library ( yes my library has many copies of this season ) , though it took me a few weeks to get bumped up on the request list . I had recently finished season one and was craving more of the delightful comedy of this series.Though season one may have been a little more fun , there is plenty of hilarity during this season . For those who do n't know , this series was created by the team that brought Frasier to us . Quality shows both . The writing is excellent and the actors play well to their talents and stay true to their characters.What this show is about is making odd family and lifestyle situations work in a crazy and fast paced world . The show is actually set up as a Scandanavian reality show . I do n't know if this was ever mentioned on the actual show , but it is mentioned on the website and mentioned during the commentary in season one . I think it was for Norwegian television . They wanted a reality show showing a slice of American family life . So that is why you have the periodic asides where family members talk to the camera , or the occasional sideways glance at the camera during normal scenes.If you have n't seen the show , you should probably catch a few of the early episodes of season one , but it is not required . There are n't really any spoilers and each episode pretty much stands alone with few story arcs carrying over to multiple episodes.One actor who delighted me by appearing was Nathan Lane playing 'Pepper ' . Hilarious ! This is not your ordinary family life drama . It features one somewhat normal appearing household that ends up being the most dysfunctional of the bunch , a gay couple with an adopted Asian daughter , and an older , rich guy with a much younger , hot Colombian wife and her son . Queue laughter ! Deserving of each and every Emmy they have won and will continue to win .	1
I did n't get hooked on this show until the second season , but was unable to watch it regularly like I wanted to . So , I bought this season ( and the first season ) to watch in my leisure time . Not only am I completely hooked on this show , but so is my 12 y.o . son ( whose favorite character is & # 34 ; Manny & # 34 ; ) . We have watched these seasons backwards and forwards and love every minute of them . Season three is already in my Amazon cart . The price of seasons 1 and 2 was an absolute STEAL ! Glad I bought them when I did ! This show is EXCELLENT ! ! !	1
Did n't expect this but this became instantly one of my favorite shows . All around funny in every aspect . Definitely better on blu ray !	1
This is one of the best shows on TV . The writing is quick , witty and hilarious , the acting is fantastic and it 's just one of those shows that even though it can be a bit out there sometimes , you can still find it relatable .	1
While this was clearly a winner with its first season , Modern Family has managed to stay on top . At the moment together with the Big Bang Theory it si the best comedy on TV . There is not one weak episode really and the episeodes go freom nice humour to pure slapstick . One of the best is hwen the Dunplhy children walk in on their prents i n the bedroom . The acting and the writing is simply superb and this series is a real joy to watch .	1
When is this show not funny ? Well not as much as the first season but definitely has some knee-slappers . I 'm not sure if the writers are already running out of & # 34 ; real life & # 34 ; to inspire the show but we 'll see where this second season takes us !	1
If you 're a mom & dad or any 2 person parent couple , this episode is classic ! That 's all I 'll say about it ... but it 's a must view episode & # 34 ; Good Cop , Bad Cop & # 34 ; !	1
This is funny , realistic , and very well-written . Three Families , all related somehow , are interwoven in this series . It 's great entertainment .	1
In my opinion , Modern Family is one of the best written , acted and directed TV shows in a very long time . It contains that rare combination of very smart , creative writers and talented actors ( across the board ) who mesh very well together.With a few rare exceptions , I enjoy almost every episode and laugh out loud quite often . That is the sign of a great show . Season 2 is fantastic .	1
I love this program.My tastes usually run to the PBS type show/programming . I have to say I love Modern Family for many of the reasons I love PBS . Brilliant writing , intelligent , thoughtful characters , good plot development are a few . If you 're not , start..you wo n't be sorry .	1
I loved the first season so i knew i was going to enjoy the second season , it was laugh out loud funny !	1
Ca n't stop watching . I just know life is not really like this , but it is true escapism . I just want to keep watching another episode , another episode , another episode .	1
I love this show because of the characters and the actors that play them . Love that each episode there is a continuing story line with the lives of them all as well as new cases the lawyers work on get intertwined with them .	1
The model of an underlying story punctuated with self-contained episodes works for us . We keep coming back because the writing , acting and contemporary background feed off one another to make the whole gtrster than the sum of its parts .	1
I loved everything about this series . Sort of reminds of of Boston Legal , but without all the crazy lawyers ... . although there are some in this show , too .	1
Another great season from what is becoming my favorite television drama ! Julianna Margulies gives another stellar performance . The plot thickens .	1
The good wife is a very addicting show . It hooks you from the first episode and never gets boring ! I highly recommend it !	1
The Good Wife is not just a one season wonder . The second season is just as entertaining as the first . Not sure why I did n't get hooked on this series before .	1
Just a good watch . Keeps a person interested and wanting to know the outcome . AND THANKS TO PRIME NO COMMERCIALS !	1
Love it could n't wait to see the next episode . I will continue to watch as long as this series is avaliable	1
Already on Season 4 and soon to Season 5 ! Ca n't stop watching it ! Beware , you 'll get hooked on this series ! !	1
This series follows a wonderful story arc . And the acting could n't be better . Diane Baranski should win more Emmy awards .	1
Legal shows often get boring after a few seasons hard to keep your interest but this one is good . It has enough behind the scenes things going on to keep your interest . I am up to season still entertained by the show . Great cast they all interact well together . Show is well worth watching . Its not the first choice to watch for me but I do enjoy the show .	1
VERY PROFESSIONAL , GREAT DIRECTORS , PLOTS ARE REAL , ACTORS ARE THE VERY BEST , LOVED EVERY CHAPTER , i HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS i DID !	1
This has become one of my top ten shows on tv . I look forward to it every week . The drama has been greatly enhanced by several developments in the plot and characterization.First , Michael J . Fox has been added to the cast . He does n't have a big role but when he is on , he is great . He is a lawyer who will do anything to win his case , including using his significant physical disabilities in order to win the jury 's sympathy and understanding . He tries to lure Alicia into his firm and I can see that becoming a real viability for season three . One thing he can do is an incredible job at winning his case during the day and then putting it away at night when he turns to his long term marriage and family . This no other character on the show can manage to achieve , especially Alicia.Alicia 's husband has been kind of the bad guy throughout whereas her old boyfriend , now law boss , has been seen as the good guy . These lines have been considerably blurred this season . There is an element of ruthlessness to both men this season . However , Chris Noth as the husband , comes across as untrustworthy in every frame . You do not grow to like him . Ironically , this is a change for Noth who more familiarly played the `` good cop '' on shows such as Law & Order.The very best though are the characters of Alicia and her best friend , her firm 's detective . There is a terrific crescendo which builds in the second season which involves both of them and the potential to make them enemies instead . I ca n't say more because this is something you want to watch develop on your own.Eli is becoming a favorite of mine too and he is especially great this season when he is attracted to a new character , the former star of UGLY BETTY . Slowly you begin to see Eli like and respect Alicia a lot more than his political client , her husband . Alicia and Eli have come a long way together without becoming love interests.Everyone else does a great job too but I have outlined my favorite characters and developments in the show .	1
This series never disappoints . Great characters and great acting with great stories . Hard to stop watching . Multidimensional , just like real life .	1
Love love love the Good Wife . I am addicted . Truly a fan ... .Gripping , want more , more and more ! This is the best !	1
The Good Wife is one of the best . Its right up there with the likes of Deadwood . Can not wait for season 3 .	1
I have rated this as a 4 star simply because I do n't necessarily like 'drama TV ' . My room mate does and we take turns picking what show we will watch throughout the week . However , if drama is what I 'm looking for , I would most likely give this a 5 star rating . The Good Wife does bring interesting characters , in terms of guest and leading , and has encompassing story lines . It also resolves the 'story lines ' , which too many similar TV series do not .	1
If you think the title means it 's a & # 34 ; chick & # 34 ; flick , you need to watch an episode or two . Terrific characters and very clever plotting .	1
I always loved Julianne Margulies , now double that . I watched the pilot episode because I always wondered what the show was like . After that I was completely hooked . I watch one episode and then just one more , OK then really just one more ... I have to break myself away to stop watching it and then I still ca n't wait to see the next one . Perfect cast !	1
The script is well written . One is skillfully drawn into an understanding of the complex relationships among the characters without being clobbered with violence or excessive drama .	1
I was impressed but not surprised to read that Tony-award winning playwrights do some of the scripts for THE GOOD WIFE . It 's a very well crafted show , and I think it 's easily the best of the year . Some episodes are better than others , and the whole show confuses being a lawyer with being a private detective ; Alicia gets a disproportionate number of sympathetic PRO BONO clients -- but there 's enough humor and cynicism to make up for these conventions . It also takes a lot of skill to keep Alicia 's husband from ever seeming either crooked or honest , but always floating somewhere in between . I waited a year to get the series on DVD , rather than watch stray episodes at home and miss the continuity , and as soon as the set arrived , I had a wonderful week watching two or three episodes an evening . Now my only question is , how could anybody stand waiting during the commercials ?	1
These were excellent episodes . I was watching them again to refresh plot details and very glad I did that . The writers have done such a good job with their entwining story lines .	1
A very pleasant surprise that keeps on going and getting better and better from season to season . The writing and legal topics selected are clever , involved and handled extremely well . With elements of The Paper Chase , The Good Wife take it to a whole new level . You wo n't believe who shows up on this intelligent series and how sensitive topics are handled . Exciting , informative and extremely entertaining .	1
As a fan of good legal drama , this has been among the best I 've ever seen . The series brilliantly weaves the wife 's personal struggles at home with her unfaithful husband and children with her attempts to put her own life in order by returning to work as an attorney after her husband loses his elected position to to a sexual scandal . I have seen all of Boston Legal and Damage , and this is as good as these . Among the best TV available .	1
HARD TO STOP ALL AROUND GOOD COURT SHOW I LOVED IT WE COULD NOT STOP WE WATCH ALL THE SEASONS BACK TO BACK	1
I like this show . I would give it three stars b/c its not perfect . but at amazon , 'I like it ' equals four stars .	1
The good wife is a great addiction ! Writing is great , acting is great , streaming is great . This is just one more reason I love my Prime Membership .	1
and the first was great . It gets deeper , more intense , more integrated . It breezes by occasional moments of implausibility , melodrama , a ludicrous plot twist here and there .	1
I can hardly stop watching this show , have to get caught up so that I can watch the new series . This show is something real and interesting each time I watch . It has interpersonal relationships that they are secretive about so that you want to watch to see what happens next . Also each show has something that could happen in the law that might happen to anyone that you know .	1
Fast shipment . Discs nicely protected in plastic sleeve and easy to remove . Not a single scratch on any one of the discs . I 'm very happy with my purchase .	1
The exquisitely written and stunningly executed CBS drama `` The Good Wife '' ( created by Michelle King and Robert King ) airs here in Australia on Network TEN , and I love it ! ! ! ! Season One certainly set the tone for what was to come in Season Two with just the right texture of family and legal drama . But it is the intrigue of intra-office politics taking center stage in Season Two which takes the viewer captive , and leaves you with a thirst for what is to come in the next episode . If this tv show was a novel ... .. it would be a real page turner . I highly , highly , highly recommend it . And I look forward to the DVD ! ! ! !	1
Each weekly episode involves an interesting legal quandary , not like Law and Order , more along the interpersonal lines than the legal one , but they do throw in a curious twist . The interaction between characters is interesting , the viewer finds themselves liking the characters that they should n't , curious about those with a hidden past , feeling the pain of a jilted lover , smiling at the softness of those with harder edges . Overall , the play among the cast is tantalizing . There is always a story within a story.Whereas in Law and Order you have a bunch of stodgy old judges , The Good Wife has a recurring cast of quirky but fascinating judges that seem to appear with a regularity that makes you glad to see them again . Guest appearances are fun and what is funny , one of my favorite characters is not a regular , yet she should be . Maime Gummer ( the daughter of Meryl Streep ) plays Nancy Crozier a lovable quirky lawyer that has me wondering if she really is as nave as she pretends or does that woman have brains under all the blonde hair and beauty.If you are not much of a late evening television watcher and have not had a chance to see this program , I highly suggest that you take your time ; track down the DVD 's of this series and settle in for some great television	1
Good story , good acting.It is about a law practice and the people who work in the business . My husband is hooked on this series !	1
Very well made and acted series # 2 of the Good Wife . All the characters were believable and likeable . The action in the series was exciting and I really wanted to get to the next story to find out what was going to happen . I wish Amazon Prime would offer more of the Good Wife series , so the story can just keep getting better and more enjoyable to watch .	1
Terrific show , great actors ! Having worked with lawyers for over 30 years , I find this show fascinating . So nice to watch these shows without advertising .	1
This series has it down . Drama , romance , intrigue and politics . The characters are believable with outstanding performances by the entire cast . Well worth your time .	1
I got this for my wife after she saw season 1 . But , to tell the truth I 'll be watching it too . I got her season 1 because she likes the show but missed alot of earlier episodes and wanted to see what happened . I just happened to watch one with her and now I 'm hooked too . This is really good entertainment .	1
This show covers a life of a house wife that has a cheating husband and is trying to make a good life for herself and her children	1
Watch it ! There have been a fair number of lawyerly dramas the past 10 years or so . This is one of the really good ones !	1
This series is intelligent and & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; . It shows people in real office situations and how different women deal with them .	1
I am really liking this show . There is depth in the characters , not good , not bad . But just ordinary people . Well , maybe not ordinary , but there is reality . I enjoy the story line , which moves at a steady pace that at times keeps me on the edge of my seat . The program has intrigue , heartache , treachery , love , sex , and identifiable characterizations . My kind of show .	1
Loved the continuation of drama between characters . They seem to honestly , get in and out of trouble with ease . You never know what trick or legal loop hole will be used next . Lots of fraternizing between co-workers in the firm which always lead to a crisis . Loved it .	1
This has to be one of the very best shows out there ! You wo n't be sorry for buying the series-you 'll watch this one over and over . The leading actors are awesome and the scripts well written !	1
The Good Wife is like a book you ca n't put down . I 've been obsessed with this show ever since I decided to try it because it was in Amazon Prime . It is so good , there are many days it is my sole motivation for getting out of bed at 4:30am to work out ( I watch on my Kindle while working out ) . Dont let the fact that its a network show dissuade you from watching it . The writing and acting is top notch . 5 stars well deserved .	1
This is a relatively intelligent show , with some good acting , and an interesting background ( made all the more so with recent news about the resurrection of Sanford ( although without the support of his wife ) . Any way the lead actress Alicia creates some interest as an older female lead as an associated , which compares to the often ridiculous idea in these kind of legal shows that a young hot shot lawyer in her 20s would be trying million dollar cases and murder trials - although there is some of that from supporting actors etc . She does a good job of maintaining a screen presence not in spite of age and demeanor , but because of it . The show still has the same ridiculous late discovery stuff that would never be permitted in a real courtroom , but the show is well acted and hearing about the trials and tribulations of a major law is interesting . A great component is some fun firm investigators who constantly uncover , at the last minute , trial altering stuff , which again would not likely happen but after all this is TV not real life . The investigator creates a lot of screen interest as a young , tough , sexy , ethnic ( it is woven into the show ) woman who does n't share - little bit like the Lizbeth of dragon tattoo fame , but not as edgy . Eventually I expect this will get old , but we are halfway through this second season , and waning only a little .	1
With Amazon offering seasons for free , this was an opportunity to watch a show I was interested in seeing . I 've watched season one , which got me hooked , finished season two and am about to start season 3 . Again , I 'll say , I am hooked on the great characters and watching their development so far . I loved Julianna Margulies in ER and am totally awed by her growth as an actress in this new show ; she is the perfect & # 34 ; good wife. & # 34 ; The partners are fascinating in what they will do and how close they come to the line for their clients - cutthroat office politics - indifference to the plight of the opposite party in their cases - illicit romance , you name it . The entire cast is wonderful , fascinating , and engaging . I love hating the creep who is her husband and cheering on Will . The political angle , which became more prominent in this season , shows all the dirty linen of who is willing to do what to get where , and who suddenly realizes dirty politics makes them feel dirty . Great show ! Thanks Amazon for the opportunity to watch it !	1
Sexual tension and courtroom drama , what 's not to love ? Great cast of regular characters with a spattering of special guests to keep it interesting .	1
Still one of the best shows on TV . Acting is superb . Thank goodness the writers on this show have not & # 34 ; stooped & # 34 ; to the level of the writers @ Scandal where nitwits reign supreme .	1
I can watch TGW over and over- it has great writers and actors- all tv should be this good- hope it lasts many episodes	1
Politics and law are mixed with discrete sex and little violence in this season . It is scary to know that this happens in real life .	1
Chris O'Donnell , LL Cool J , Eric Christian Olsen and Daniela Rua all deliver fantastic performances as G Callen , Sam Hanna , Marty Deeks and Kensi Blye . You 'll find intrigue along with drama in the second season . A must for any NCIS : Los Angeles fan .	1
NCIS Los Angeles has some pretty good looking men on it . I like its plot and look forward to seeing more	1
I love the NCIS both LLCool J is so good looking in these series , not to mention the rest , but I 'm LL Cool J fan all the way	1
You see how how hard it sometimes is with undercover work and you get some more background on the characters o.f this great series	1
A body theft that ends in murder in the Morgue draws the attention of the OSP when the stolen corpse is found to have been tagged by a US Navy tracking compound called Overwatch . Things take a deadly turn when Canadian smugglers steal 4 containers of Radioactive Pharmaceuticals and plan to sell them to terrorists .	1
Okay this is a great series and the pack is great but just one little thing I have come to hate on certain sets including this season and the previous . They print the episode guide on the inside of the main cover so you have to pull it out to read it and yes it made the front plastic cover part of the case split . What is this idea and what total idiot thought of it , obviously someone who does n't buy dvd 's and wants to read the episode guide . Come on its stupid and annoying . Otherwise great set and great features as well .	1
I ordered episode Pyramid , the final episode in the PtoP killer , because I forgot to tape this episode in the NCIS marathon on New Year 's Day . I just starting watching NCIS and I am hooked on the show .	1
To me this is the best drama on TV . well written , acted , good actors to bad we lost zeva , dam it.But love these guys ! ! ! and gals ! !	1
It appeared to be more complex and held my attention better . Tony seemed to mature a little and after all these years he should get rid of some of the nonsense . Overall I liked it very much .	1
Have all 8 seasons on DVD now as we love this show . Watched them so much we can almost say the dialog along with the actors . The plots keep you on edge , the actors really mesh together . Love that Mark Harmon ! !	1
I love NCIS and this has been one of my favorite seasons . I recommend NCIS to everyone I meet . The DVDs were in good shape , and have served me well .	1
I am almost finished watching season 3 but decided to go ahead and get seasons 4 through 8 so I would have them when I got to them .	1
If you have ever watched this show you know this is a must , this is a great series to get and I would say get all of them its worth it .	1
Like that this show is about the milatery . The actors are great . Like the way the caraters work together and have fun with a job that can be vary hard at times .	1
This was an excellent season- do n't want to give any plots away , so I will just say I enjoyed ! And an Excellent transaction from seller ! ! THANKS SO MUCH ! !	1
The entire season was in perfect condition and we have watched every bit of it . Thanks for being so prompt in mailing . The price was good too !	1
I have all of the seasons , because I can watch them over and over and still enjoy them as much as the first time I watched them . The cast is a perfect match . They all have a unique personality that makes them stand out alone . Together they are awesome . I love who-done-it shows , and this is definitely a keeper !	1
always enjoy NCIS , , , drama comedy suspense all in one show , , , looking forward to season 11 after watching seasons 9 and 10 ... great characters ! ! !	1
One of the few current TV shows I watch because it has a good plot , good characters , and no fowl language and no overt sex ! Even the gross stuff is not that gross compared to a lot of shows . Gibbs is caring , Tony does n't want to grow up -- but really does have a serious side , McGee is the computer nerd that is the perfect friend ; Abby is so very smart and wonderfully her own person ; and Ziva is so beautiful , yet can beat up on any man and Ducky and Tim are just so great . What 's not to like about this show !	1
We began watching this video , but stopped it a short way into it when we realized this was not what we had hoped for . It was too contrived and predictable .	-1
The DVD transfer is pretty good but the scene with Yukon discovering peppermint has been cut.It seems pretty odd to sell a DVD as a restored classic only to leave out the main thing that was to be restored !	-1
I must agree with the other reviewers that this set is awful as it does no show the episodes in the original clifhanger form as shown on TV . I will be the first in line to buy underdog when it is produced as it was ORIGINALLY shown with all the shorts like tennessee tuxedo and commander mcbragg and with the cliffhangers . Come on guys give us the original show as it should be and this set will fly off the shelves . Until then you can keep this junk .	-1
The title of the product gives the impression that the contents will be the complete series of Underdog . Afterall , is that not what the collector would want ? However , all in all , it is about 11 episodes , which is sadly disappointing.There is no continuity between the episodes , no obvious reason for the grouping , nothing but a quick assembly and package job in hopes of suckering an old fan into buying just a piece of what he really wants.As has been stated here , there are none of the `` cliffhanger '' episodes , which is both a plus and a minus . The little cartoons were most enjoyable , and the handful we are given is a sad sampling and a sorry excuse . However , on the other hand , it is nice to be able to watch an entire episode of Underdog without being interrupted.But again , beware of this product , as it is nothing more than a tease . I suggest not buying it now , but rather waiting until the whole series is released on DVD , to save having to pay for the same thing twice .	-1
This is the worst movie NOT about Jesus ever made ! Instead of making a film about Christ 's life and/or his message , Mel Gibson makes a slasher flick about what the government can do to another human being . If you are a twisted person who enjoys watching over 2 hours of obsessive blood & torture , then you will love this absurd gore-fest . Otherwise , it 's an obscene , narrowly focused , remote , spiritually uninvolving , and amateurishwaste of time . The acting is average and there is an anti-Semitic message simmering at the surface of this mess . Even Satan is portrayed as a cliche -- -an ambisexual hooded figure lurking in the background of several scenes . There is nothing new here except that all of the actors speak in Aramaic , which is distracting since you must read subtitles . The slow motion scenes are so self-conscious that the film becomes tedious to watch after awhile . Plus , there are historical inaccuracies contained within , like the fact that Romans did not nail spikes into Jesus ' hands but his wrists . Overall , this movie told me next-to-nothing about the man called Jesus of Nazareth . The only vaguely interesting part of the film was the music , which reminded of the excellent music from `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' composed by Peter Gabriel . ( The CD is titled `` Passion '' . ) In fact , if you want to watch a deeply moving , spiritual film , rent or buy `` The Last Temptation of Christ '' , which was a gritty , realistic interpretation of Jesus ' life , and contained a rare look at the human side of Jesus . ( It seemed to me that Gibson was influenced by this movie and decided to do his own version but failed miserably . )	-1
I finally saw this film after everyone has said all that can be said about it , so I 'll be brief . Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel `` Sadist '' Gibson , I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe , but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim . In short , it 's just a movie , not a particularly good one , with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what 's happening or to make you care . It looks terrific -- -Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness . But that 's about where the praise ends . The whole thing has a nasty tone ; in Mel 's version of the tale , anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery , and while I 'm not a believer myself , my guess is that 's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it . And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end , eyes a-blazin ' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack , I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to `` Braveheart Part II . '' Mel Gibson is a wretched director , and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously , for that gives them clout they do n't deserve . All he 's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie , complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire `` Friday the 13th '' series . This stuff was camp 30 years ago , and it 's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie 's complete lack of narrative grounding . See this or do n't see this , whichever is your preference . But religious or not , this film is not going to change your life . If it does , then you need to get a different one.Grade : D+	-1
I came at this film from a non-Christian perspective in that I think the events portrayed either never happened or were so distorted by those who wrote the Gospels that they beared no resemblance to history . That meant I could n't respond to the guilt trip Mel Gibson meant to put on everyone about how Jesus suffered for everyone 's sins , so I looked at it as just a movie . A very boring movie.First the good parts . I thought using the ancient languages worked very well as did the look of the film , which featured some good filter effects ( the garden scenes ) and a drab color palette that evoked the past more than a bright one would have . I also liked Maia Morgenstern 's performance as Mary . She did an excellent job of portraying her mixed feelings of pride and pain . The sets of the city were good and there were some great landscape shots , especially from the mountains . I also thought the DTS soundtrack was very good.Those were n't enough to make this a good movie for me though . The beatings grew boring very quickly , which made the final half of the film very tedious for me . Mel Gibson mostly worked in caricatures , portraying the Roman soldiers as mindless brutes , the apostles as dim-witted cowards and the Jews as a rabid mob . James Caviezel did a good enough job playing an impossible role , but I did n't find someone covered in blood or woodenly quoting biblical passages particularly interesting . The scenes with the Satan character did n't work for me at all.There was also the problem that , if you were n't a Christian or familiar with the Christian mythology , this movie would have made no sense at all . I guess to Gibson this was n't a problem , since he was making this film for a specific audience . That audience made him a lot of money , so I suppose the choices he took worked for his pocketbook . That does not make this a great movie though . ( As far as the anti-Semitic question , I agree that this film qualified . The Jews suffered for centuries because of the `` Christ Killer '' label , and this movie echoed that belief . The Romans may have did the killing , but the Jews started the ball rolling , a fact Gibson hammered home repeatedly . Like father , like son . )	-1
Purely from the point of view of watching the movie it was amazing . The film costs here were amazingly well spent ( thats what the stars are for ) . To film a movie in Latin and Aramaic was brilliant and the sets and costumes were amazing . I think they could have saved about half the movie budget by having Jesus expend a human amount of blood but that 's ok -I realize it was necessary for Gibson to stay true to his fundamentalist Catholic views and strictly follow the stations of the cross in depicting the passion of Christ , even though there is no scriptural evidence for them . Having said this though it is important to point out what a horrible theology this movie presents . It is essentially the Anselmian view that Jesus was incarnated as the only sufficient sacrifice for our sins . As this movie presents it the only significant part of Jesus 's life is his death . It is this sort of blood-soaked religious ideology that says it is ok to kill people as a means of purification.Even as an atheist I can see that this is probably the most immoral of all ethical or religious doctrines . If you want a sound theology try Abelard or some of the Franciscan authors . In their writings the incarnation is the culmination of creation , an event that was planned from the beginning and NOT simply a reaction to `` people behaving badly '' . It represents the ultimate unification of God with His creation . The moral lesson comes not from the death of Jesus saving us from our sins . ( which mires human beings in eternal stupidity and does n't apparently cure us of sinfulness either ... so it is pretty much a wash ) The moral message needs to come from Jesus 's life ... take care of lepers , eat with tax collectors , help a prostitute get on her feet . Things get a little messed up but its not anything that can not be fixed by simply doing human things .	-1
I went to see this movie with a very open mind . Initially I was pleased with the cinematography and a little dissapointed with the somewhat contrived acting . The opening part of the movie is by far the most interesting and rich in terms of storyline and aesthetic beauty . This part of the movie is what nails it in the two-star range . What ensues , however , is probably the most deplorable attempt at sensory manipulation I have ever witnessed in my life.In a time when neoconservatism and counterfundamentalist-fundamentalism gripped the United States by the jowels this movie made a somewhat fortuitous entrance onto the world stage . As the bells of war sent young American soldiers out on the battlefield to defend Western hegemonic positions by way of `` the Almighty '' ( Bush 's great justification ) this movie danced across movie theater screens and attempted to do much more than tell the story of the life of Jesus . This movie turns Jesus into a symbol of cultural supremacy , a source of endless blood and suffering , and the American flag manifested in human flesh.As I sat and watched the hour and a half of torture unfold before my eyes I looked around the theater to see the faces of the families which so many claim to exemplify `` family values . '' What these children were watching was not a recreation of a myth aimed at reinforcing social solidarity , but a blatant piece of sensory manipulation which aimed at reinforcing xenophobia and notions of cultural superiority .	-1
From a purely literary viewpoint , the trial and execution of Christ is one of the most powerful stories ever told . But in Mel Gibson 's new film `` The Passion of the Christ '' the fine drama is turned into coarse melodrama , as Gibson concentrates on flaying , blood-flying violence , the kind that appeals to the same people who flock to slasher movies . In fact , there may be those eagerly awaiting `` The Passion of the Christ 2 : Peter Gets His '' . Of course , there is violence in classic art . The Christian iconography of the Renaissance has canvas after canvas of whippings and nailings ; but those images are static and stylized , not the graphic naturalism of motion pictures . Speaking of which : Gibson , in promoting the movie , has emphasized how realistic his picture is , an oblique put-down of the Biblical epics of he Fifties and Sixties . Granted , many of those productions were artificial and sometimes not even very entertaining . ( At the risk of being hunted down by the NRA , I must admit I think `` Ben Hur '' is about 45 minutes too long . ) But the fact is `` The Passion of the Christ '' possesses the same artificialities as those old films -- presenting , for instance , a tall and handsome Jesus . There is a very strong likelihood that the historical Jesus looked more like Woody Allen than Jeffrey Hunter , but Gibson 's realism evidently did n't extend into casting . There are also some unfortunate lapses into what can kindly be called poetic license , including a sit-comish flashback where Mary is confused by a modern table constructed by her smart carpenter son . I 'm giving the picture two stars , one for the cast 's restrained ensemble acting and one for the superb photography of Caleb Deschanel . As for the movie itself , simplistic and sensationalistic , I do n't think it 's at all what Matthew , Mark , Luke and John had in mind .	-1
I watched the Passion of the Christ with my atheist husband . While we were watching all of the blood and guts flying around . He asked a wonderful question . What is the point of this movie ? What is the movie trying to say ? Then I realize that he is totally right this movie does n't really say anything . All we mostly see is Jesus brutally dying on a cross and flashbacks of his life for cheap thrills . I am a Christian and I thought that this movie really did n't have a point . I already knew that Jesus suffered before he died ; it did n't really affect me seeing it so graphically.What I mean is that if you see it from an atheist 's point of view , there is no point to the movie . The movie does n't tell us why Jesus was dying on a cross . Since the movie 's focus is on Jesus ' suffering , the message gets lost to non-believers . Personally , I was more affected by the Book of John than by this movie . Jesus had a lot of love for people in that movie and you could n't help but love Him . You do n't get that watching this movie.Now I would recommend this movie to people who really hate Christians and love seeing artwork of crucifix 's mutilated . You guys can watch Jesus suffering over and over again and laugh your heads off .	-1
As an Asian American male , I can objectively state this movie is highly anti-simitic . Quite frankly , I have no idea what people were looking at when they wholeheartedly claim this movie has no anti-jewish theme . Here are few I found quite objectionable because the biblical account of Jesus 's death has been twisted to place the blame of his cruxifiction solely on the Jews.1 ) Pontius Pilate tries to save Jesus and is portrayed as the good guy . He is not an objective and ruthless Roman governor , but a man who is interested in the truth of Jesus 's teachings . Three separate times , he tries to save Jesus 's life . First , when the Pharisees and the Jews bring battered Jesus to him , he actually complains that they beat him even though he is yet to be convicted of guilt . Then , refusing to condemn the man , he sends him to Herod . When Herod sends Jesus back ( again not finding him guilty ) , Pilate again tries to save Jesus by giving the Jews a choice to save him . The Jews , of course , chooses to save Barabas instead . Then the Pilate tries to save Jesus AGAIN by just beating and flogging Jesus , hoping it will quell the Jew 's anger , the Jews rejects Pilate pleading that Jesus had suffered enough punishment and should be set free . The Jews , and only the Jews , demands Jesus be cruxified.2 ) The high ranking Pharisees are seen beating Jesus with their bare hands . This scene was utterly ridiculous because it was an equivalent of a Pope beating a Jew with his bare hands ( which may have actually happened few hundred years back ) . Not only is this scene unbiblical , but historically unlikely . The Pharisees were very picky about who and what they touched . A blasphemer was considered unclean and untouchable , especially by pharisees , and beating Jesus with their bare hands broke their own strict rules.I found it disturbing that few twists of the story were all catered to blaming the Jews . In this , I found it even more disturbing than Jesus 's death itself . He did die , after all , as a practicing Jew .	-1
If this movie was about anything else other than the passion of Christ the very people who support it would be screaming to ban it . This is an incredibly violent film with needless buckets of blood . Seeing the son of God turned into hamburger did not inspire me or increase or decrease my faith . Truly awful acting from secondary and tertiary actors and blatant homophobia in the Herod portion of the film add to a nasty mix . Good acting from primary actors and superior cinematography are the few saving graces . The bold decision to make this multi-lingual and subtitled also deserves to be tried again . Only for fundamentalist Christians and devout Roman Catholics and not be viewed by anyone under 17 .	-1
I am not cold , nor am I without heart . I cringe when I watch this movie . I weep to think that this would happen to the most guilty of men let alone a good man who 's done nothing to deserve it . And though I am not a Christian I respect the story of Jesus . But , this is the most unrealistic movie I have ever seen portraying his life.99 % of the story , the dialog , and the violence is not an accurate portrayal . It 's not just that most of the story is made up or is n't accurate according to the Bible , but most of the dialog is made up too . Most of what is supposed to be from the Gospels is altered in some way to say something other that what scripture says.The violence in itself is another story . Though it is told that Jesus was tortured and suffered , the violence depicted in the movie just is n't realistic . It 's not just that 99 % of it is n't mentioned in the Bible , but there is no way on Earth that Jesus could have survived 20 minutes into the movie . If he had n't bled to death first , the fishhook type whips used on him would not only have ripped his flesh off his body , but gone in and ripped out his internal organs too . It 's just not realistic . No one could have survived that . Not even the Son of God.The portrayal of the Roman soldiers that beat Jesus was n't realistic either . I know that the Roman soldiers were cruel and could be sadistic but the way they are portrayed in this film is as much over the top as all the violence . The Bible mentions nothing of all this punishment . He was n't beaten and whipped and kicked around the way they showed as he carried his cross to Calvary . He fell three ( 3 ) times . And most of the portrayal that went on with him being nailed to the cross and set up is n't mentioned at all . Him being flipped over the way he was . Geez ! What this movie blatantly is , is an attempt to play on the emotions of those who believe so deeply in the story of Jesus . Period . It 's false propaganda and it plays its part well . You can tell by all the reviews stating this was the most realistic version they 'd ever seen . Do n't buy into it.Any Christian who is interested in watching a more accurate portrayal of the life of Jesus would be far better off watching Jesus of Nazareth . Or any non-Christian who 's just interested in learning about Jesus ' life . The real purpose of Jesus ' life is portrayed in Jesus of Nazareth , and done very well . His teachings . That is what is really important , not this excessively violent and unrealistic version.I 'm giving this movie two stars because of the use of Aramaic and Latin , and because the cinematography was beautiful . Oh , and because the rendition of Satan was really creepy .	-1
This film leaves so much to be desired by the time the closing credits roll , you wonder why you sat through it in the first place . It appears to have absolutely no purpose ... just meanders along violently ... never giving ... and there are few stories whether true or fictional that are better more exciting fare for good film-making than this -- so the plot was thick and ripe for an amazing movie experience ... but they just didnt pull it off unfortunately . If you love the Jesus story you will be sadly dissappointed by this strange twisted desultory mess of a film .	-1
I cried when I saw The PASSION OF THE CHRIST - how could you not ? I sat there and watched a man brutalized for two hours . Everyone around me was crying - it felt like we were all tuned in to the proceedings of a televised execution . I was a little confused by the time it was all over & as I was leaving the theater , I was even more so : I saw parents walking out with their children . Jesus Christ 's teachings were left in the wings , the significance of his life locked out of the script almost entirely . Hardly a first impression for young children . The ONLY things I found at all interesting about the PASSION OF THE CHRIST : the use of the authentic languages from the time period ( Latin & Aramaic ) and the actors bringing this movie to life . James Caviezel 's performance in Terrence Malick 's THE THIN RED LINE was simply mesmerizing , and he used a similar pallet of emotion for his performance here . I was raised a Roman Catholic - so viewing the Stations of the Cross was nothing new to me . To suggest this film version of that seasonal meditation is a `` masterwork '' - simply is absurd.So what WAS the point of this film , what were we to draw from its brutal imagery ? There was no inspiration in Mel Gibson 's film for me , no arc of understanding - only suffering and death . Which led me to consider their goal may have been to create a vivid emotional experience , intended to lift us out of numbness and inspire reflection on faith to get us through this life : televised warfare , beheadings on the internet , stories of sickness and shootings on the nightly news , etc . Perhaps , but I do n't think so . A fleeting , knee-jerk reaction with some tears shed on queue , and then those emotions are safely placed back on the shelf until the next time . Complicity and silence have always gone hand in hand : it 's easy to damn this world , condemn what we see as different from our own huddled beliefs ; allow selfishness and insincerity to decimate through clouds of frankincense and joyous hymns . Salvation ? Maybe.The infamous THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST , directed by Martin Scorsese , is a `` masterwork '' of filmmaking . The film not only inspires the heart , but also prods the mind . I could feel the breath of those images , allowing me to enter the world it created and truly feel something more than myself . It was not an epiphany ; it was a fresh view , it was an enlightened dream of another world , yet strangely our own . The film did n't plague the audience with blood and horrors ; it dramatizes the passion and relevance of the story . I 've come to understand and believe Jesus Christ to be among the greatest teachers this world has known , who suffered the tortures of the damned to inspire his vision of peace , determination for truth and humility in us all - ideals that have taken a back seat to robotic , indignant servitude to skewed `` moral '' interests.The LAST TEMPTATION was based on the book by Nikos Kazantzakis - from which the filmmakers created a thoughtful , passionate re-examination of one of the greatest stories ever told . Mr. Scorsese , in his youth , had almost joined the priesthood ; but chose to explore and express his passion through the cinema . I saw no blasphemy in his images - only a powerful film exploring faith in ourselves and the world . Often cited as trash , garbage and against popular faith - this film truly offers a story of FAITH we can all profit from , regardless of what we believe .	-1
I ca n't understand how people can see this as a recruiting film for churches . Frankly , I worry about people who liked this having custody of children or pets . If anything , it made me want to avoid churchgoers as I avoid Nazis and Klansmen . If I were a Martian arriving on earth and this was shown to me to explain this major religion , I would recommend having the earth vaporized before this dangerous insanity spread . Jesus said some admirable things about mercy and forgiveness , but you wo n't find them in this sick piece of trash .	-1
I rented this movie undeterred by the negative reviews regarding too much violence that I had heard from friends . After all , I thought depictions of graphic violence would help illustrate how horrible the crucifixion was . Unfortunately graphic violence alone is n't enough to give this movie the emotional impact that the subject deserves.The audience goes into this movie with knowledge of who and what Jesus is . For this reason Mel Gibson apparently thought that no character establishing scenes were necessary . All we learn from this movie is that Jesus was a guy who suffered a lot . In fact the ultra-violence actually made the crucifixion seem less agonizing to me . I could n't help but think that after losing about 3 gallons of blood ( based on the large pools left on the ground after he was flogged ) and the beatings he took about the head , that Jesus would have been too far gone by the time he was nailed to the cross to feel much pain . The few , brief scenes which did n't involve Jesus ' torture were mostly uninspired clips of events which occurred in the days prior to the crucifixion . These are scenes that those who have read the bible are all too familiar with , and the dull , monotone delivery by the actors does nothing to bring these scenes to life . The scenes of Satan and demonic children throughout the movie seem random and silly . How the writers and director could do so little with such a great story bewilders me.A far more moving movie is Jesus of Nazareth . The only objection I have heard about Jesus of Nazareth is that Jesus is played by a non-Jew with blue eyes . If you ca n't get over that then you will be depriving yourself of seeing a movie about Jesus that delivers far more insight into what a wise , charismatic , and loving entity Jesus was . Brilliant performances combined with a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack make the crucifixion scenes in Jesus of Nazareth carry far more emotion impact than the passion of the Christ did .	-1
If you are really serious about faith , grace , committment , what one is suppose to do in this world , how we are to respond and take care of others , Gibson 's mindless Hollywood Smash here is useless and a gross waste of time . It reminded me of a Playstation or XBOX game come to life in the screen.Jesus was a subversive a revolutionary , He wanted you to know his Father and what the Word of God means , and how one conducts himself in the beauty of one 's faith . For a deeper understanding of what I am talking about please see Pasolini 's `` The Gospel According to St.Matthew '' . There all the Hollywood buzz , hype , blitz , zizztz is removed . This is a film from the early Sixties and Pasolini was quite brave to make it , portraying Jesus as a revolutionary , and giving one something to think about . With Gibson as most Hollywood films you check your brain at the Box Office before entering.What does Gibson tell you here about Jesus , any new insight into belief and faith in our post 9/11 era ? ? Nothing at all , just gratuitous violence that is `` Fun '' for many unfortunately .	-1
I should have left this review a long time ago . I could kick myself for buying it , thinking it was a film , not a religous object . If you critisize this film amongst religious radicals , you risk being burned at the stake , an act of love to purify your soul.This film , as a film , disregarding the topic , is a dog . A cheap `` B '' grade , blood spurting , flesh flying horror flick in Aramaic with sub-titles . I could go on for an hour , but wo n't bother .	-1
Christ is to Adult ... as Santa Claus is to Child . What kind of sick mind would let their kid watch this pornographic trash ? The kind of person who thinks `` Jesus '' is going to `` come back '' . The type of person who believes MILLIONS are going to `` HELL '' , if they are `` unsaved '' . The fact that this MYTH of Jesus and the Bible continues to hold sway the world over is nauseating . This religious nonsense has gone on long enough . Throw this sick fantasy away and instead use common sense .	-1
I just viewed this movie last weekend , and finally I get to see a better portrayal of the religious story.I understand that Jesus in the stories is beaten and scourged before his crucifixtion , so there has to be a movie where we get to view Jesus finally experiencing pain . Of all the films that have been made on the passion , this one is the most accurate , but still not perfect.What 's wrong with it ? How about the retarded little things Mel Gibson inserts , like the devil , or small children chasing Judas Iscariot . What a fluke , I laughed my butt off at that part . Just stick to the official stories of the bible there Mel . Your just proving that religion is worthless and can be rewritten as stories just like that . Also the dropping of Jesus off a bridge was funny.One last thing I 'd like to point out is the terrible scourging of Jesus . At first it was believable , but after they used those inch and a half hook whips that dug into the table , but still only managed to rip Jesus ' skin off after about 70 or so whipings was absolutly mental . I know for a fact with those whips , they would 've ripped all his flesh on his back right off the bone . Terrible terrible , it would 've killed him . But still , he manges to stand up and carry , probably more than 100 pound big piece of wood , WHILE enduring more whippings , beatings , nails in his hands and feet AND without any hydration . *rolls eyes*Did I mention Jesus is still a white man from the Middle East ? *cough*Watch this for its take on the STORIES in the bible written by men , not for historical content .	-1
Not the great or best look at the Gettyburg battle and the events that led up to and occurd during the battle along with the people involved . It is to short .	-1
As I remember vaudeville was n't in style until the early 1900 and yet here is Jesus doing shtick . I do believe that he could smile and see humor in some situations but the Sermon on the Mount was not one of them . I could only make it through 9:9 and had to turn it off . Just too much levity for my taste.Joy and happiness should be in the heart , mind and soul . Not external as depicted in this movie . I kept waiting for the custard pies to start flying.But , in all fairness , the movie was beautifully filmed .	-1
Possibly the worst kid 's movie I 've ever seen . My wife opined that this `` was the worst movie in the history of the universe . `` Well , maybe not , but strictly for girls under age 6 .	-1
I HAVE TO BE HONEST I DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE AT ALL , LOOKING AT THE REVIEW ON AMAZON , SUGGESTED IT MIGHT BE PRETTY GOOD , BUT I HAVE VIEWED OVER 240 CHRISTMAS MOVIES AND THIS ONE IS ONE I WILL PUT IN MY NO # 6 BOOK AND LETIT COLLECT DUST . I JUST DID NOT LIKE THE PEOPLE STARRING AND THE WAY IT WAS PRESENTED . I DO NOT USUSALLY DISLIKECHRISTMAS MOVIES BUT THIS ONE , SOMEONE WHO GOES TO CHURCH ALOT MIGHT ENJOY IT ? I BOUGHT THIS FROM THE AMAZON MARKETAREA , AND IT WAS A GOOD PRICE .	-1
I remember seeing this little movie when I was 10 or 11 and was quite shocked by it . Imagine my disappointmet when I got this horrible transfer into my player ! Anchor Bay , one of my absolute favorite distribution companies , has failed . The print is terribly scratched and the sound goes in and out towards the end . Do n't bother .	-1
This one totally bites . Unless you were born in the 40 's this one is completely out of date . No bite no bang and way too much buck . The music is so annoying my girlfriend had to leave the room . Hippy dippy elevator music with big bad bikers . Everyone in this movie is an idiot and none of the chicks are hot . If you are into biker flicks check out Hell Ride . That 's a biker flick . This is yet another example of how phony the 60 's were . Save your money . I wish I had .	-1
I was not entertained and found the movie without story or goal . A lot of do nothing people doing nothing . I did n't think it possible for Jack Nicholson to make a bad movie . I was wrong .	-1
It took a month for me to actually receive this film . I have been waiting for years to see this , the last Godzilla film I needed for my collection . I should have waited longer . Even if you do n't mind that this is a cheap DVD-R bootleg of a shoddy print , or that the title is spelled wrong , or that the cover and label are ugly as sin ... you should not buy it . Why ? Because the last chapter of the disc does n't play ! You ca n't even watch the whole film all the way through . I have returned and replaced this disc twice already and they were all the same . I 'm going to avoid all DVDs from & quot ; Cine Vu & quot ; from now on .	-1
The DVD is terrible . First , though the cover promises a widescreen transfer , the DVD is horribly cropped , so 50 % of the scope image is missing.If that were n't bad enough , the picture quality is very , very poor and during motion scenes ( most of the film ) the picture blurs ! The old Goodtimes LP speed VHS tape from the 80s looks better than this.Avoid at all costs !	-1
First things first , I hate to admit it but I 've never read Emily Bronte 's classic novel ` Wuthering Heights ' , therefore I ca n't comment on whether or not this cinematic production from '98 is an accurate retelling of the tragic love story of Heathcliff and Cathy.Secondly , I do n't see any reason to give a synopsis of the plot since the majority of people reading this review are already quite familiar with the storyline.That now said , I will say that this is one of the most bizarre , depressing and unromantic love stories I 've ever seen . The two love birds , Heathcliff ( Robert Cavanah ) and Cathy ( Orla Brady ) are myopic , narcissistic , manipulative , cruel and overall downright unlikable . What can you conclude about a guy whose only comment after his true loves death is , `` Did she mention me ? `` Final Thoughts : Beautiful cinematography , wonderful production values and attractive period costumes ca n't compensate for two main characters you just ca n't force yourself to care about . Maybe this is your cup of tea , but it 's not mine .	-1
Really did not enjoy this movie at all . I did not like the actors and it just did not do anything for me .	-1
A very plotless movie about a ww2 american soldier and japanese soldier on a deserted island -- -- sort of thing THE TWILIGHT ZONE did a lot better in 30 minutes ; this plotless movie is almost two hours ! Even a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode in which Charles Bronson and Elizabeth Montgomery are opposing survivers of ww3 had more dialogue and plot than this movie.From director John Boorman -- -his DELIVERANCE is a million time better , though it 's as much a jungle movie as this thing .	-1
Roman Britain ? Not quite . A fun foray into Hammer 's skewed history ? Definitely . This film works on the most basic level . Warrior chicks and Roman villainy with a mad druid for fun . The best acting in this little sizzler comes from that late great charactor actor Patrick Toughton . There are moments when it seems like he is in a completely different film ... yes , he 's that good . Andrew Keir is not to be missed as the scenery chewing evil centurion . A mediocre effort at historical film making , but a great deal of fun !	-1
This was not a box office hit when it was first released ; most critics hated it . Time has not tempered its many flaws . The humor is broad and at times overbearing , abrasive . The lead character is a nitwit , obnoxiously stupid . Oddly enough , this is the only character played for laughs , the rest are deadly serious in their intent ( none more so than Oliver Reed as the villain , one of the few bright spots in an otherwise dreary enterprise ) . The effect is quite jarring , as though they forgot to inform Michael Crawford that they had changed their minds , the piece was now a gritty spy thriller . Unfortunately , it 's never as funny as it should have been , and not serious enough to work on any other level.This is not a movie I 'd ever want to watch again under any circumstance .	-1
C'mon people ! Five stars for this garbage ? I 'm a big horror fan , I like & quot ; weird and offbeat horror & quot ; , and have enjoyed other Italian horror films by such directors as Mario Bava . Based on the great reviews of this movie on this site , I decided to pick this one up and was I ever disappointed . It 's not scary and you 'll see more gore in a Friday the 13th or Freddy Kreuger movie . The plot is so incoherent that the film becomes absolutely tiresome to watch . The only good things about it are seeing Jennifer Connelly run around in her nightgown , and the heavy metal soundtrack ( which actually sounds very misplaced in parts of the film ) . The best part of the DVD is listening to the commentary by the filmmakers , who actually seem to think they 've made some great piece of art with this film , when it 's really just high-budget amateur hour . The only reason to watch this film is if you want to see a slightly weird , bad horror movie . If you do watch it , keep your expectations waaaay low .	-1
Produced by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava , this hyper-gory Italian film is about a group of people who are all given free tickets to a horror movie . Soon after it begins , the unsuspecting moviegoers , like the characters in the film , start turning into flesh-hungry zombies . It all sounds promising enough , but that 's where the originality ends . The audience inexplicably finds itself trapped inside the theater and the rest of the movie is pure formula : a group of anonymous , one-dimensional characters is picked off one by one by the zombies , only to become zombies themselves , who ( you guessed it ) pick off the remaining anonymous , one-dimensional characters . Of course , Bava knows that it 's all about the gore and , on that score at least , Demons really delivers . There 's enough gut munching , eye gouging and scalp tearing to satisfy even the most hardened gorehound , and the special effects ( courtesy of Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti ) are about as good as they come . Thirty-something types will also appreciate the early ` 80s heavy-metal soundtrack , which features M & ouml ; tley Cr & uuml ; e ( `` Save Our Souls '' ) and Accept ( `` Fast as a Shark '' ) , among others.Two and a half stars out of five .	-1
It has a stupid plot - just natzis killing bedwins and bedwins getting even and it continues into a stupid violent movie of cold blooded killing . if you love violence watch this but do n't waste your time - this movie is not worth the 3 bucks used DVD . The portrait of violence is ugly and upsetting .	-1
Automatically this movie gives off a typical seventies version of a horror movie , complete with skin tight jockey shorts , fading pastel colors and scooby doo hair doos . The beginning leads the viewer to believe that something evil is learking off in the distance , like a predator seeking it 's prey . Yet how far can one go with a black car , with tinted windows who spends most of the movie gunning people down , off the roads . Never is there any evidence that someone is behind the wheel , for all the viewer knows it could be a 16 year old with a remote control out for kicks . It 's VERY far fetched , and annyoing to watch , as no one is clever enough to just blow the stupid thing up , until the very end . Not to mention all the graded , loud music that sounds like someone scraping together pieces of metal ... it 's not enough for any true horror fan to stand for a whole hour and a half ... .not to mention there was never any hope for a sequel ... & quot ; Car The Revenge ? ? & quot ; Give me a break ! N.C .	-1
Out of every christmas movie I 've seen , never has one made me so depressed . I do n't feel like there 's much more that I can say without giving away plot points , in case you do want to watch it ... but really ... .did not leave me feeling jolly at all ( especially the fact that elves do n't work for santa , dead people do . That 's right , once you die you go to work in santas sweat shop ) .	-1
the writing and acting is so poor compared to the new hit show , Downton Abbey . I suppose back when it was on , it was ok , but nothing like Downton Abbey !	-1
Unresolved technical issues with this series.Sound and the color is absent from some . Hopefully Amazon will eventually correct this , because the series itself is worth watching . but for now ... do n't waste your money .	-1
I think that Samantha Morton 's Jane Eyre in Robert Young 's 1997 TV adaptation of the great novel , could 've been the best screen Jane ever . Morton was 20 years old and the closest in age to the young orphaned governess , childlike in the appearance but strong willed , serene yet very intelligent with acute sense of right or wrong . Two years prior to her Oscar nominated role as a mute girl in Woody Allen 's `` Sweet and Lowdown '' , Morton proved that she could say a lot by the mere look at her face , by her impressive and speaking eyes alone . It is sad that the film took too many liberties with the book and not only in omitting many important plot lines in order to fit in its 108 minutes length , but with too many changes to the very nature of the novel 's two main characters and their relationship . Jane in the scenes with her employer is sometimes too demanding and not as tactful as she is in the book . The changes are especially obvious in Mr. Edward Rochester as he was played by Ciaran Hinds . Hinds is a talented , intense actor but I ca n't agree or like his reading and interpreting of Mr. Rochester 's character . Some his scenes in the film made me cringe . Mr. Edward Rochester of the novel was not yelling or rather barking brute - it was difficult for me to believe that Jane Eyre would come to love so much . I also was unpleasantly surprised with Mr. Rochester openly displaying his affection for Adele . This manifestation was against the logic of his character.2.5/5	-1
This 1997 TV production is called `` Jane Eyre '' , but except for a similarity to the plot of the novel there is preciously little in this film to remind you that you are indeed watching an adaptation of Charlotte Bront 's literary masterpiece . How they managed to get every single character of the novel wrong - except for Pilot , who is well cast - is a complete mystery to me , but they did . This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds they had two good actors , who even physically fit their roles well , but , alas , the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation . Samantha Morton - young , delicate and plain enough - looks like Jane Eyre , but does not play Jane Eyre . Her Jane is far too bold , even disrespectful at times , self-confident and self-satisfied , bossy and pert . Gone is the interesting duality of Jane 's character in the novel , her outward shyness , guardedness and modesty on the one hand and her fire and passion on the other . Morton 's Jane speaks her mind boldly right from the beginning and never stops doing so throughout the film . There is no subtlety in her performance , her Jane undergoes no change and no development . The same is sadly also true for the character of Mr. Rochester . Believe it or not , but they indeed managed to turn one of the most interesting and complex figures of English literature into a brute and a bully . Luckily Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds possesses some charisma , but otherwise nothing links him to the eloquent and fascinating character of the novel . Not the slightest attempt was made to explore the depths of Rochester 's character , his many contradicting facets , his moodiness , his inner struggle , his humour and his tenderness . The Rochester of the novel is admittedly insolent and harsh at times , but never the unrefined , snarling brute Ciar & agrave ; n Hinds makes him . Yet Hinds is even worse at playing the loving Rochester , and the only feeling he manages to convey is lust.Unfortunately the misrepresentation of the characters is not limited to the leading roles : Blanche , besides being blonde , is not in the least haughty enough , not to mention the fact that she is nice to Ad & egrave ; le , St. John is all smiles and kindness , and the role of Mrs. Fairfax has been unnecessarily puffed up , probably due to the fact that she is played by dear Gemma Jones . Yet some scenes less with Mrs. Fairfax fussing around and some scenes more between Jane and Rochester would have been very helpful to make the audience understand why the two latter fall in love in the first place.As far as language is concerned this production is another victim of the delusion of some scriptwriters who either think that they can improve on Charlotte Bront 's brilliant language or that her 19th century English has to be simplified to become digestible for a modern audience . The result is that the dialogues are severely changed or replaced by the scriptwriter 's own banal lines . In either case they have lost all the charm , sparkle and brilliance of the dialogues in the novel . Poor misguided scriptwriter Richard Hawley even deemed it necessary to make Rochester introduce one of his most famous lines - the line about the string that inextricably binds Jane and him together - with the words : `` I know it may sound silly but ... . '' No , Mr. Hawley , if somebody sounds silly here , it is definitely NOT Charlotte Bront ' ! Another capital error of judgement - and unfortunately also an insult to good taste - is the way they rewrote the farewell scene between Jane and Rochester after the aborted wedding , a scene , by the by , which in all the modern adaptations has received a particularly brutal treatment . Whereas in the latest Jane Eyre production of 2006 that scene was an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Jane , the way the scene is handled in this adaptation is an outrage to Charlotte Bront 's Rochester . What ? Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him , bullying her , throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay ? Absolutely ridiculous ! It is hard to imagine what has gotten into the filmmakers to produce such rubbish as this.This is the worst , but there are many others scenes which are similarly absurd and ludicrous : the first scene of Rochester galloping in slow motion through the mist before he falls into a brook , Grace Poole coming out of the lunatic 's room to sniff at Mason 's wounds like a wild beast , Rochester sitting on the top of an archway of Thornfield as if he were the court jester and Mason jumping on horseback over the church fence to prevent a marriage of which he has heard only heavens knows how.Equally lamentable is the filmmakers ' inability to represent the correct social behaviour of the 1850ies . Rochester and Jane are far too disrespectful to each other at first and later far too hot . Sentences like `` I feel that your passions are aroused '' are appropriate for `` Sex in the City '' , but not for a costume drama , let alone Jane Eyre . Obviously the filmmakers decided not to bother at all - neither about being true to the novel , nor about portraying the novel 's era accurately . The result is a sad failure - as both a film and an adaptation of Jane Eyre . The only fact with which the makers of this Jane Eyre can console themselves is that the BBC failed even worse in the subsequent production of Jane Eyre in 2006 .	-1
Cirian Hinds and Samantha Morton are wonderful actors , but why did n't the screenwriters even glance at Charlotte Bronte 's book when they wrote this screenplay ? It was a very strange experience to see some of my favorite characters of literature saying and doing things that were n't even remotely connected to the story . Rochester screaming at Jane to leave Thornfield ? Jane and Rochester shopping downtown for wedding clothes and `` bumping into '' Blanche Ingram ? I do n't think so ! Not only did the screenwriters make up entirely new scenes , the dialogue in familiar scenes was often totally unrecognizable . I watch film adaptations to see my favorite characters and scenes fleshed out , not given a major overhaul.Two things they got right -- the age difference and chemistry between Rochester and Jane ( although Samantha Morton is too pretty . Come on ! She ca n't be pretty Harriet Smith in the A & E ; version of `` Emma '' and plain-Jane Eyre in this movie ! ) If you just like to watch good acting , you might like this . But if you , like me , are a fan of the book , this is a very jolting and unpleasant ride .	-1
When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson 's `` Jane Eyre '' movie , they had to leave everything out that could n't be condensed . The mini-series approach , however , allows ample time to study the characters in depth . In my 29 years , I recall not one , but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s . These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience . I wo n't judge which of the two is more definitive , having only read part of the book.The 1983 one , released to VHS/DVD , starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke . Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane , mistreated by her aunt Reed 's family and at Lowood school . This is the first hour of the series , and I was riveted . When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives , Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they 're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack . The series is excellent , almost to the point where I 'd call it treachery that it 's not available either on VHS or DVD . This was no minor production : in fact , it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.Dalton 's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious , almost a caricature . It 's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion . Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side , but balances sardonic wit with what 's been called a `` poetic imagination . '' Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane . You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role . His enthusiasm for the part is obvious . Clarke 's Jane is plain , and seeks independence , love and servitude , but it 's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from . It 's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking , although that may be . Cusack , an Irish actress , is irresistable in more ways than one . A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate , she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester , trading jabs , despite the difference in age and experience . Thus , in the early scenes , we get a good sense of Jane Eyre 's spiritedness ( even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood ) . The interaction of Dalton and Clarke , while fine , falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.Other things to note : the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK . The memorable theme music was the passionate `` Introduction and Allegro '' composed by one of Britain 's greatest , Sir Edward Elgar . My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft , the screenwriter , Robin Chapman , and to the cast : Megs Jenkins ( Mrs. Fairfax ) , Stephanie Beacham ( Blanche Ingram ) , Geoffrey Whitehead ( St. John Rivers ) , Susan Brodrick ( Mary Rivers ) , Caroline Harris ( Diana Rivers ) , Edward De Souza ( Richard Mason ) , and the rest.It 's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them . `` Jane Eyre '' is a classic novel . Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale . In fact , it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale , now . Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of `` Jane Eyre '' is not `` bad , '' and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.If you write to the powers-that-be , BBC America or BBC Worldwide , they 'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release . Go ahead and give it a try . Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.There is a website dedicated to the 1973 series that can be easily found . Look online also for an image of the Radio Times cover that announced the original broadcast .	-1
Since I did n't know the story I was disappointed by it . The acting was OK but the story itself was not something that I had expected . I enjoy all of Jane Austins works and stories such as hers , also Downton Abby , Cranford , North and South . This was not of the same class , neither story line or acting .	-1
My husband and I watched this movie , and felt we had waisted our money . Pride and Prejudice FAR outweighs this one.First of all , the music in this movie we found to be barely tolerable.Secondly , In my opinion , the foul language could have been left out of this movie . Making it a bit more family friendly . Thirdly , We did watch it till the end , but it was a drudgery.I have read the book and will say that they perhaps did the best they could at putting this book on screen as it would be a difficult screen play to write . But some liberties were taken in the movie that I did n't like.Overall , it was a waste of time and money.On the other hand , Pride and Prejudice , Persuasion , and Jane Austen 's Emma are excellent movies on which to spend your valuable time and money .	-1
The performances were passable - in my opinion Mark Strong did a fine job . Since this dvd is an early presentation , sorry to say I was disappointed in the quality and could do nothing to improve the viewing experience . Sadly , I returned the video - the return process with Amazon was very amicable - that 's the only positive I could come up with , that is why this review receives a one star rating .	-1
no no no boring boring and again very boring - we all know the old story very well , but is not done well in this movie	-1
She belongs on todays sitcoms . The other characters were fine , but she was so modernly caustic , if this can be said .	-1
Kate Beckinsale 's performance , to me , seemed extremely one dimensional . We certainly see the vanity , but none of the compassion which makes Emma a worthy ( albeit immature ) hero traveling along her arc . By comparison , Gwenyth Paltrow 's performance ( within a year ) shows us a misguided socialite , who repeatedly displays compassion.The best example might concern Emma 's view of Martin . While Paltrow tells us he is beneath her , she also points out that were he less fortunate ( than he is ) , she would feel honor bound to help him . Kate 's Emma , on the other hand , simply despise him for no good reason.Having watched both features back to back , Beckinsale strike 's me as a twin sister of Mrs. Elton , rather than Austin 's kind-hearted , but misguided Emma.I would recommend forgoing this version and taking Paltrow 's instead .	-1
I agree the the reviewer 's comments that Daniels is miscast as Washington . No one would take him for a Virginian ; rather like the old Disney production of the Swamp Fox played by a young Lesley Nielson with a New York accent . Also Welsh actor Roger Rees with an English accent plays the Scottish general Hugh Mercer who had to flee Scotland for supporting Prince Charlie.One of the worst and unexcused errors is when Washington asks after the battle : `` how many killed ? '' `` None '' ( correct ) . `` How many wounded ? '' `` none '' . Incorrect . There were four wounded one of whom , the most seriously wounded was a young lieutenant in the 3rd Virginia named James Monroe . Fifth president of the United States . Worth mentioning I would think .	-1
the one star rating is because the price is highway robberyI got the Emma Peel MegaSet for less than this setAdjust the prices and I will purchase all of them	-1
There is irony in the fact that when I came here to review this the advertisement shown was for `` The Dark Knight Rises . '' I had just been shaking my head over the fact that whoever filmed this apparently decided to loan Sir Percy Batman 's utility belt.I 've read the books and enjoyed them , but I do n't insist that a Scarlet Pimpernel movie be a down-to-the-last-detail adaptation . But this show had a crudeness and vulgarity that the novels simply did n't have , and it seems to me that if you 're going to appropriate a book 's title the least you should be expected to do is not butcher the entire flavor of the story.This Scarlet Pimpernel is n't demmed elusive , he just goes storming in with more weaonry than his opponents and kills people right , left , and center . The elusiveness is what the story is supposed to be about : a trickster who outsmarts his opponents and is almost always so many steps ahead of him that he does n't need to resort to brute force . There was no delight in watching it - ha ! I did n't see that coming ! Oh , marvelous ! - as there should be.The book was wildly romantic in a purple-prose sort of way , and I simply ca n't see this version of Sir Percy kneeling down to kiss the ground Marguerite has walked on . And there is very little difference between the way this one acts when he 's being Sir Percy and when he 's being the Pimpernel ; no reason anybody would dismiss the very thought that Sir Percy might be the intrepid , mocking shadow that is driving the French authorities to distraction.Even apart from those objections , the story is quite muddled . Having read the books , I knew pretty much what was going on , but if I had n't I would have been left baffled.Complete lack of chemistry between Percy and MargueriteDo yourself a favor : Watch the Leslie Howard version , or the Anthony Andrews version . This one is n't even going to stay in my video collection . A la laterne with this DVD !	-1
Dont get me wrong . This is a great movie , and the second one is great too . But these transfers to DVD 's are complete rip offs ! Where are the bonus features ? ? ? ? ? They may come with trailers , full screen , and subtitles ... . but I was very disapointed when these came out on DVD and had nothing else included on them . And I know the stuff exsists ! I remember very clearly watching a behind the scenes featurette on home alone , and home alone 2 when they where about to be released . I remember Daniles talkin about how he was the guy in charge of whats funny , and i remember them talking about how it wasnt filmed at christmas and they had fake snow , and fake pigeons ect ... . WHERE ARE THOSE FEATURES ? ? ? ? ? To a person who dosent care about bonus features . Then go ahead and buy these great movies . But for someone like me who does want things like that , espesicly for such a huge comedy smash hit like these 2 movies , youd expect more wouldnt you ? Even Audio comentary would be nice ? Why is this blockbuster sucses treated so poorly on the DVD release ? ITS NOT EVEN IN SURROUND SOUND ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ( 5.1 ) I hope they release a better special edition of these films with features worth buying , to replace the old VHS copys most of us have . Untill then , keep your videos , the dvd 's arnt worth getting yet	-1
THANK GOD IT 'S FRIDAY is a hokey little film that record labels Cassablanca and Motown put together to capitalize on the Saturday Night Fever craze that was happening in the late 1970s . Like a cheezy `` Love Boat '' episode , there are multiple stock characters here such as the aspiring entertainer ( Donna Summer ) , the womanizer ( Jeff Goldbloom ) , the bickering married couple , the `` Good Girl '' ( Debra Winger ) and various singles looking for that `` special hookup '' while the disco beat thumps on and on and on . Worth a look to catch disco styles of the late 70 's and see Donna Summer sing the Oscar-winning song `` Last Dance . ''	-1
Words fail me in attempting to describe just how poor a movie In the Company of Men is . Aside from obvious flaws like the lack of a single compelling or sympathetic character , Men suffers from amateurish acting , a painfully bad script devoid of any wit or insight , and a frighteningly shallow and stilted portrait of men and male behavior . As bad a movie as you are likely to find anywhere .	-1
I vividly remember seeing `` CE3K '' as a teenager and I especially remember the ads with the long stretch of highway and the ominous quote `` We are not alone ! '' . Seeing the film 25 years later makes me wonder what all the fuss was about . This has to be one of Steven Spielberg 's most overated films . It resembles a tv mini-series , long and plodding , and follows a select group of characters and their experiences with UFO sightings and abductions . I 'm all for character development but most of these characters get stale really quick and you just want them to get on with it ! As with many early Spielberg films , there are lots of noisy , irritating kids and messy houses which are meant to represent suburbia . After a long hour and a half , these people finally make it to Devil 's Tower , where the aliens arrive and communicate with humans . This sequence is still dazzling , but basically just amounts to a spectacular light and sound show . And , oh yes , that five note tone gets really irritating by the end of the movie ! I was disappointed with the quality of the dvd as well . There is a highly noticable `` shimmering '' in the interogation scene between Dreyfess and the government agents . Also , the night sky scenes looked uneven with streaks of gray overlapping the blacks . Many scenes were `` soft '' and uneven . The bonus disc , however , is very nice and contains great interviews and a documentary about the making of the film .	-1
I was sorely disappointed with this movie . I loved it when I was a kid , but after watching it for the first time since it was in theatres , I just was n't impressed at all . I saw the DVD and could n't resist , but I wish I would have . This has got to be one of the slowest movies I 've ever seen . Spielberg never has been too impressive in my opinion , but this is pathetic . At least Jaws and E.T . have some action throughout the entire movie . Here you get a small glimpse of the alien happenings at the beginning , 1.25 hours of boredom , and an ending that just was n't nearly as good as it was when I was kid . My kids could n't stand it , so it 's obviously not a timeless classic , like the other space/alien movies of the late 70s early 80s .	-1
Could n't understand the hype and praise about this smothering piece of forgettable artsy-fartsy film . My friend and I could not wait to get out of the movie . Sensory overload , pseudo-intellectual/historical overkill , a morass of images and cacophonies -- -please , spare us and other hapless victims this unnecessary cinematic trash .	-1
A disappointing treatment of a Cyperpunk classic , Johnny Mnemonic tries too hard and in doing so completely fails to impress . The dark , oppresive atmosphere of William Gibson 's future comes across rather well only to be spoiled by blunt and unimaginative acting . The special effect sequences suffer the same fate and come across more like a poor advertisement for the land of tomorrow than an accurate depiction of Gibson 's view of the Internet of the future . All in all the movie 's a real let down and there 's more to be gained by reading Gibson 's Cyberpunk novels : Neuromancer , Count Zero , Mona Lisa Overdrive and Burning Chrome ( the short story collection from which Johnny Mnemonic was taken ) END	-1
In the future of `` Johnny Mnemonic , '' couriers with chips implanted in their brains must smuggle their gigabytes past the shady underworld of the ever-present Yakusa and the `` low-tech '' rebel groups bent on destroying technology . Johnny ( Keanu Reeves ) is one such courier , desperate to end his career so he can reclaim the memories he has had to sacrifice . He agrees to one last mission , one that threatens to kill him , both from those who want the information and from the information itself seeping into his nervous system . Everyone wants his head - literally.It has been said that Keanu Reeves can not act , and this film is indisputable proof of that . He has two expressions : dumb and angry . Sometimes he goes from one `` emotion '' to the other in a split second . In Reeves 's defense , however , the script gives him little to work with . His character is one-dimensional - he wants his memory back , but never badly enough to drive him . Even worse , he is surrounded by vague supporting characters : a former bodyguard suffering from an ill-defined syndrome that seems to affect a large percentage of the population ; a rebel leader ( Ice-T ) who does little more than spout one-line pronouncements ; a corporate executive who lost his only daughter to the same disease afflicting the bodyguard ; and a Yakusa boss with no definition whatsoever . Why is there a rebel group ? Why does information have to be regularly smuggled ? Why is Johnny 's chip government-approved , even though he seems to have no connection to officials ? These questions are never answered , or even hinted at.William Gibson , the father of cyberpunk , wrote the screenplay based on one of his short stories . Perhaps because of the originally shorter length , the film is sketchy , stretched by Tron-like images ( Tron ( 20th Anniversary Collector 's Edition ) ) and an apocalyptic world reminiscent ofMad Max ( Special Edition ) . William Gibson should stick to writing novels , as he seems unsure of how to develop this very different medium.I do n't recommend this film , not even for Keanu Reeves fans .	-1
This review is for the Director 's Cut version of the DVD . After all the good reviews on Amazon and from others , I was looking forward to seeing this movie . Thankfully , I rented it.After about 1 hour and 15 minutes , I turned it off . To sum it up : BORING.So what happens during the first 1 hour and 15 minutes ? There is a party . Then they set sail in das boot . They have no specific orders ... just cruise around the ocean . They are spotted by a destroyer . They endure depth charges . They keep sailing.Some people will likely critique my review , saying that war can be boring . That 's fine . I 'm not at war . I 'm watching a movie . Good movies are not about hum-drum everyday life . They have some substance . This movie has no substance . At least Seinfeld ( a TV comedy series about nothing ) has something to offer . Das Boot -- the Director 's Cut has very little to offer . After watching and waiting for something to happen for 1.25 hours , I was n't about to waste another couple of hours on this extended version of the movie in hopes that something would happen.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star military/war DVDs : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
THis is unbeliavable . Jon Voight being in it ... Everything is so bad , so ludicrous , so lame and mean . THe acting , the sanke , the plot , the ending , the beginning , the special effects , the scenario . My God , it 's awful ! ! It 's so awful that , even resisting , you 'll find a smile forming on your face , so funny it is . So , I 'm giving the note the producers surely wwanted to take when they shoot this : one star . Congratulations ! !	-1
Hey , producers ... Stop making killer animal movies please . Snakes , sharks , piranhas , bees , killer insects etc . OR try to write a better scenario . Even jennifer lopez could not save the day !	-1
Save your money and time.Just say no to this disaster of a movie	-1
I believe all movies should get a chance . Most film critics do n't beleive that , using hype , budget , production difficulty , and false over-expectation to shoot a movie down before it even has a chance to defend itself . And I 'll admit , in it 's original theatrical release I did n't give this movie much of a chance . Then I watched it on HBO and thought it was okay , better than I thought at least . The actors are good actors but they seemed to just not care about this movie , the effects are good but anaconda 's could n't never move so fast and agressivly , the story is good , but if you do a movie like this make the snake behave correctly , get actors who give a crap , and do n't have such a corny human villian .	-1
Jon Voight is the only credible Actor here.ICE CUBE & amp ; Jennifer Lopez Ca n't Act at all.the Effects are Funnier than they should be the same goes for the Script.Avoid this Film at all Costs .	-1
I remember when this film first came out and I saw the trailer . It was the scene with the very young Natalie Portman asking Jean Reno what his job is , and he answers `` cleaner , '' then she says `` you mean a hitman , '' he confirms it , and she says , `` cool . '' It looked intriguing and I aways wanted to see it.I was n't expecting `` Sansho the Bailiff , '' but at least a coherent storyline , believable characters , and events that could actually happen on some planet somewhere . Leon , played by Jean Reno , is supposedly the best hit man in New York , but he lives in a hovel while his handler , `` Tony '' played by Danny Aiello , claims to be holding his money for him . I fully expected some showdown between those two , as everything was telegraphing that Tony had no intention of ever letting Leon have his money except for doling out a little occasionally . It is also revealed that Leon is illiterate , drinks only milk , and is inordinately attached to a houseplant that he introduces as his `` only friend . '' Very well , a hit man is never going to be `` normal '' in any sense.Mathilda , played by Natalie Portman , asks Leon to allow her to be his apprentice after her family is murdered . Leon tries to cheer her up with a puppet , showing himself to be at heart a funny and playful fellow ( he also likes old musicals ) , but the relationship between the two is implausible . Leon agrees to take her on after she fires off a few rounds from his balcony and they have to suddenly leave the apartment , houseplant in hand , when any real hitman would have left her there as too great a risk . She soon comes in handy when she can fill out the registration card at the hotel they next stay in , but surely Leon has stayed in hotels in the past - how did he register before ? In a particularly amoral scene , Leon shows Mathilda how to shoot a rifle , firing what turns out to be a squib at a jogger . As someone who has owned and used firearms for many years , I can vouch for the fact that the normal course of instruction involves practicing at a range with paper targets , or in the desert with soda cans , before actually shooting at a live target . Hardly `` professional '' as Leon says about Mathilda 's balcony shooting spree.Stripping away the violence and lurid charm of a hitman , at bottom this is the story of a middle-aged curmudgeon forced to care for a waif , and developing an attachment against his better judgment . This was done far better two years later in the Academy-Award winning `` Kolya , '' a vastly superior film with a significant historical and political element utterly lacking from `` The Professional . `` `` The Professional '' is yet another one suitable only for those who have committed to seeing every film ever made .	-1
Luc Besson 's film on the relationship between a professional hitman ( Jean Reno ) and an orphaned girl ( Natalie Portman ) who seeks protection from the murderous rampage of a corrupt narcotics cop ( Gary Oldman . ) There are several problems with both the plot and theme of this movie which , taken together , make the film both unrealistic and perverse.First of all , there is nothing professional about the supposed professional hitman played by Jean Reno ; as the character portrayed seems to suffer from retardation and ineptitude . An otherwise professional sociopath suddenly has a heart for a defenseless little girl ? But it does n't stop there . The relationship between Portman and Reno has strong sexual overtones which Besson intentionally emphasized by the mood of the dialogue and , most importantly , the very suggestive camera angles on Nataly Portman : the continuous angling of the camera on Portman 's hips , waste , crotch , and rear , makes this theme all too clear . The movie therefore presents pedophilic sentiments as normal and legitimate . Sorry , but a film on the lustful woes of a 40+ year old deranged assassin for a young 10-12 year old girl is n't worth a second look . The best performance in the film is by Gary Oldman who plays the corrupt police officer.Altogether a pretentious film that , due to its perverted theme , has absolutely no redeeming value . The plot itself is too absurd to be credible . Rent if if you must but I would n't buy it .	-1
When Hollywood finally chooses to make a movie about the struggles , it of course chooses to tell us that even though those nasty Prods have no problem killing our people in cold blood , obtaining the arms to fight back is wrong and must be stopped by Captain America aka Harrison Ford . Please spare me from this awful movie . Shades of Tom Clancy and the rest of the UK suck ups in Hollywood . How would they like it if Malibu was taken over by `` gasp '' republicans andresidency was limited to non-actors and they had to live in San Bernadino ?	-1
Not being a Brad Pitt fan period , I knew I was in for a real 'treat ' once I came to realize that he would be displaying his 'amazing ' acting skills with an Irish accent to boot . I knew this movie was doomed right then and there . And I was right . My goodness what an awful movie . I mean I ca n't even tell you wtf was going on cuz I was too busy being annoyed with/laughing at Pitts accent and all of the bad acting . Wow , never has a non comedy made me laugh so hard . Heck most comedies do n't even make me laugh this hard.Needless to say , I do n't know what happens in this movie , I do n't even think I could fall asleep to it . I think I actually turned it off , pissed off that I had wasted so much time ( 45 minutes ) watching this crapfest . On the good side , I now randomly laugh about this movie and tell people to rent it if they are ever in the mood to laugh at one of the worst movies ever.I really do n't know how this movie made it past the script stage of the game .	-1
If you are a big fan of Kenneth Branagh , you will love this film.This is a star studded movie version of Shakespeare 's romantic comedy by the same name . If you are a big fan of any of the stars in this movie version , you may love this film.If you have not seen many stage productions of Shakespearean plays or have previously found his plays inaccessible due to the Elizabethan language , you may love this film.If you are fond of scenic Italian locations , you may love this film.I have noticed that most reviewers do love this film . You will probably love it too since most people do . If it awakens in you a desire to see more Shakespeare , then I heartily approve.I did not like this film and I know I am in the minority . I have seen numerous stage productions of Shakespeare and I guess I am a Shakespeare purist . I found this film too slow-paced for me . Despite being early evening while watching it , it made me drowsy because I was bored , bored , bored . I have only been bored once before while watching a Shakespeare production . I found this film was an adaptation and not a faithful rending of this play unlike Shakespearean stage productions with which I am more familar . Despite being a fan of Emma Thompson , Keanu Reeves ( gasp ! ) , and some of the other stars ( but not Mr. Branagh ) , their presence did not make up for what I felt was lacking in this lavish production . Some of the stars seemed miscast.Please see Wikipedia synopsis for a detailed description of the plot of this play and the characters.Please see the IMDB for the casting of characters in this movie version after reading the Wikipedia synopsis.An interesting side fact : Dogberry in Shakespeare 's play is famous for his malapropisms . The word malaprop entered the English language more a century and a half later ( it did not exist in Shakespeare 's time ) . It came from Sheridan 's comedic play `` The Rivals '' and is based on the character of Mrs. Malaprop who delightfully mangles English . I like the sound of malapropism better than dogberryism for a word meaning mangled English . As a person who loves the English language , I am glad we waited a century and a half for Mrs. Malaprop to arrive and mint a new word that is used to this day .	-1
Ok the story as an absolute story is not bad , actually it 's somehow interesting . The animation is perfect and well done too . I think this is the best film ever for Will Smith ! Oh yes , and you may accept this movie as a light commedy.One of the main downfalls of this movie was that the Science Fiction side of the film was badly affected when the story got framed into commedy ! In other words , the suspense was dead ! Some of you are comparing this movie with Star Wars or Aliens ... I think this is not right ! Nor Star Wars or Aliens was a commedy ! Instead the suspense was very genuine and the movie turned out to be very powerful Science Fictions ! Anyway , this movie maybe worth seeing once or twice ... but I do not recommend buying it unless you are a big fan of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones !	-1

I am a huge DVD fan , Scream 3 , ID4 , T2 and Fight Club have released outstanding DVD packages . This DVD however is a dud I am sad to say . The so called & quot ; extras & quot ; are hardly a token of fan appreciation for this film and I am wondering if studios actually think the buying public is nothing but a bunch of idiots . Studios constantly underestimate what the buying public wants which is why so many movies never make it to their full potential . Look at the Blair Witch Project or The Sixth Sense or any other movie every studio expected to see crumble . People know what they like and it appalls me to see that studios are becoming more and more chintsy involving & quot ; extras & quot ; with their DVD 's . Anyway , on with the DVD commentary , the picture quality is definately superior to the VHS version , however the widescreen version makes the picture quality during darker scenes much too dark and it 's hard to lighten the picture with your TV-stick with the standard format on this one . The sound quality is outstanding which is why I gave this DVD a 2 star instead of a 1 star-along with the fact Tommy Lee Jones is my favorite actor of all time . As far as extras , besides the stills , documentaries and music video , this DVD does n't really compare to the deluxe packages like the movies I just listed above . Part of what DVD is all about is getting more than just a movie , you 're getting the full interpretation of what the director originally wanted for the film . It 's obvious the studio had complete control over this one and Barry Sonnenfield should have included his & quot ; deleted scenes & quot ; since that 's what people are buying DVD 's for anyway . Every movie has deleted scenes-why not include them ? ? ? ! ! ! James Cameron is a master at this and it 's given his movies literally a second life for that very reason . Move on from this piece of trash and wait for the Star Wars Trilogy !	-1
Paul Verhoeven once again shows his incompetence as a director in this gory , tedious and all too predictable sci-fi yawn . The cast looks like something from Beverly Hills 90210 and their acting ability is equally bad . The characters are one-dimensional and boring . The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars is because it does hold some useful warnings against propaganda and glorification of war , which was also present in the Heinleins book . But as a whole I will not recomend this movie to anyone .	-1
If you are going to review a Blu-Ray movie , please describe the audio/video quality.Thanks R.Kevin Hill for explaining in detail how to get this movie to play . I just happened to have a male to female USB extension cable and a 256MB Flash Drive , which allowed the movie to play on my Sony Blu-Ray player ( the USB port is in a recessed port on the back of the player ) . What really stinks about this , is the fact that there is not an explanation of this requirement on the package , in big , bold letters . I did n't see it in the product description on Amazon either . It is a good thing I read the reviews , or I would have had no idea how to play this movie.At several times in the movie , there was a `` Do you want more information '' message , but I had no idea what to do to get more info . I tried `` Enter '' , the blue button , the red button , and directional keys . I 'm not sure if I got the extra info or not.The video quality was extremely good , 9.7 on a scale of 1-10 ( there were some scenes with some grain ) . One of the best Blu-Ray visual experiences I have had . The audio was good ( Dolby 5.1 TrueHD ) , but I did n't feel the sub-woofer bass was strong enough.This is a very gory movie - not for people who do n't like a lot of blood and guts .	-1
This movie will be a terrible disappointment to people that have read Heinlein 's book . The movie mangles the plot , ignores or misunderstands all of the ideas , and worst ( for an action picture ) leaves out all of the cool military hardware , arming the soldiers with what look like rejected weapons from the A-Team and armor from a high school football team.The commentary by Verhoeven and Edward Neumeier ( the screenwriter ) is illuminating -- neither of them have the slightest understanding of the book , and they keep repeating that the point of the movie is that `` war makes fascists of us all '' . Heinlein is not one of the more subtle writers , so I ca n't decide if they were so dumb they did n't get the book , or if they chose to ignore it . On the dumb side , they do n't understand plenty of things in their own movie ( such as why Denise Richards does n't come off as a `` career woman '' ) , and the plot details are absurdly incoherent ( the bugs shoot at spaceships by farting rocks into space , for instance , and somehow manage to do this over interstellar distances in very short periods of time ) . And I was n't able to find any points for the `` not dumb '' side.The acting is , for the most part , rotten . The male lead , Caspar Van Dien , has all the charisma of a blue jeans model ( which he might be for all I know ) , and Doogie Howser is really bad , too . Denise Richards is really pretty , but she 's rotten here . The only somewhat bright spot is Dina Meyer , but it is n't enough . All of the details about the society of which they are part are cartoonish and incosistent , and the special effects are lousy wit h the exception of some of the bug attacks . The actors look good naked in the shower scene , and that 's the high point of the movie.It 's a waste of time , and there are no armored suits , like those in the book , so do n't watch it hoping for an army of RoboCops ...	-1
As long as you dont take it too seriously this is not a bad flick . Its your typical 1990 's sci-fi with lots of special FX and ... .bugs , thousands of them , big yellow green blue horrible brain sucking mothers.Not for the faint-hearted . There is also the one-take-only co-ed shower scene in which the director had to firmly encourage his actors.A pleasant but brief interlude in an otherwise ordinary matinee movie.Not for the kids ...	-1
Like several of the negative reviewers , I also found that the disc would not play on my brand new Sony BDP 350 . First I 'd like to thank the reviewers here who explained the nature of the problem . For those as novice-y as I was , here 's the deal . On the back of your Sony , there is a recessed slot about 1 '' x0.5 '' with a USB port in it ( USB ports are probably also to be found on your computer ) . All that you need is a standard flash drive plugged in there , the same kind of flash drive commonly sold at drugstores ( I used a Duracell flash drive bought at Wallgreens ) . The only hitch is the recessed socket : it is just barely big enough to get a USB plug into it , but too small for some flash drives to fit ( i.e. , the plug will fit in the socket , but the casing the flash drive is in is too big for the hole the socket is mounted in ) . This is maddening but fixable too . If you can not get a flashdrive that is narrow and flat enough to fit in the hole ( many manufacturers are putting them in bigger cases for aesthetic reasons ) you can save the day with a male-to-female USB cable extension , which is what I did ( because I happened to have one around ) . You can probably get either a drive that fits , or if you already have one that does n't , the cable extension , at Radio Shack . Second , big thumbs down to Sony : they are responsible for the format , the player AND the film , and it 's inexcusable that their design required this -- everything should `` just work . ''	-1
I have bought several Starship Troopers/Blu-ray and none of them will play on my Sony Blue-ray player . Truly frustrating ! ! ! ! Got any suggestions ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
I do n't get what 's so great about this movie . I found it to be a huge let down . This is an ultimately disappointing film despite good performances from all of the leads . The premise is simple , Jules and Mike have a passionate affair in their college days , this then becomes 'best friendship ' in no small part due to Jules commitment phobia . One day Jules gets a call from Mike to say that he is getting married in four days and inviting her to the wedding . At this point Jules realizes just how much she really loves Mike and determines to split-up Mike and Kim . The film follows her efforts to do this . However , at every turn she is thwarted by the happy couple who get back together.This film has the good grace to make Julia Roberts character finally admit that she behaved like a semi-psychopath , but even then that confession is wrapped in pseudo-romantic humour which implies : 'Aw , shucks , well that 's OK then . 'Unfortunately not really worth watching . A pity , because it could have been much better , with its unusual take as a non-feelgood romantic comedy .	-1
I like Julia Roberts just as much as anyone , however ... ..this movie was a whole other matter . It 's a contemptible premise played entirely for laughs.Julia Roberts ( as Julianne Potter ) , is soon turning 28 and once she learns her ex-boyfriend best friend ( Dermot Mulroney , as Michael O'Neal ) is getting married she plots to break up the nuptials and snag the old boyfriend for herself . Does she love him ? This is never clear . Is she capable of loving anyone other than herself ? Doubtful . But it does n't matter anyway because she 's desperate and she is a nasty schemer and that 's what this movie was all about : duplicity.I suppose they thought they were doing a screwball comedy so nothing really matters but getting the laughs . It certainly was n't a concern that from the outset they were equating deceit with romance . In essence , stating that whatever a person does to waylay someone else 's groom is not only to be lauded , it 's to be applauded.But really , why bother ? Let 's take the groom at face value . Here 's a guy who thinks nothing of constantly flirting with his ex-girlfriend ... .in front of the woman he 's pledged to marry . A guy who needed to use his ex-girlfriend for `` courage and support '' through what he obviously saw as troubled times as opposed to a joyous occasion . A guy who raved about his ex-girlfriend to everyone including his in-laws to be . A guy who helped humiliate his fianc & eacute ; e in a karaoke bar . A guy who yelled at his fianc & eacute ; e during a dinner causing her to become hysterical and still he yelled until she apologized for something that was n't her doing . A guy who , when finally told he was being manipulated by his ex , found the whole situation `` flattering ! '' So what if his fianc & eacute ; e was put through turmoil and stress she did n't deserve , as long as he kept getting his own way everything would be fine . He gets to have a wife , and , as his ex-girlfriend joked , they could always have affairs.It also was n't quite clear why Julianne Potter was so desperate to snag a guy she called an `` insensitive doofus . '' Had she forgotten the reason they broke up in the first place ? In the end , I could n't get past the character , Julianne Potter 's , behavior ( long enough to consider it funny ) . She commits both fraud ( with the phony email ) and a felony ( when she steals a van ) . Naturally , this being a romantic comedy neither has consequences . As for her final act of non-contrition : she `` loans '' the newlyweds THE song belonging to her and her ex . And no one saw the insult in that ? The only thing that keeps this woman from being a stalker is that she was invited into the festivities by her ex-boyfriend , who throughout the film kept sending mixed signals to both women.The thing that kept me from totally hating this movie was the extremely funny performance by Rupert Everett . Unfortunately , there was too little of him and way too much of Dermot Mulroney . I did enjoy the sing-a-long dinner party , it was a hoot . I also loved Cameron Diaz and the helium trio 's harmony . Actually , there were quite a few funny bits that did n't require bail and jail time . Still , I just could n't get past the underlining unsavoriness of the victimization involved , that it was meant to be funny , that so many people seem to enjoy such antics and overlooked them as harmless fun . I know this was only a movie , still , I just found it too disturbing and not a little repugnant.Of course I did n't keep it .	-1
This movie made me so angry I ca n't even begin to sum it up . Starring the cutest , sweetie pie bad actress of all time , Julia Roberts , in the cutest , sweetie pie backdrop ever , who turns it into a semi screwball comedy ( the one saving grace ) and an all out fest of shrewish behavior and jealousy.Julia Roberts plays her every woman self who is fretting over the arrival of her friend , Dylan McDermott , into her native Chicago . The two former flames have agreed that if they do not find someone to love by the age of 28 they will marry each other . The witching hour is approaching and she confides to her sassy gay man friend that she does n't want to go through with it . Imagine her surprise when she hears that McDermott has met the woman of his dreams , Cameron Diaz , and although it 's sudden has decided that she is in fact The One . And then what happens ? Is Julia Roberts relieved that she does n't have to join in this dreaded union ? Is she happy that McDermott is happy ? Of course not . In typical irrational female mentality , she becomes jealous and furious that he is not catering to her needs.The rest of this movie is a series of plots that Julia is attempting to put the kabosh on the wedding , which are mean spirited and self centered but are hidden thinly under some screwball comedy and hijinx . I was chanting `` Kill the bitch ! '' halfway into it.And that scene where she and McDermott are under the shadow of the bridge ? ! Where he 's talking about moments that you miss and things right in front of you , then when they come out from under the shadow of the bridge and he turns away . Was that supposed to be sentimental ? ! While everyone in the theater was in tears I was also because we were on the verge of two people actually making some kind of connection in this movie and we missed it ! Whoa to the chick flick genre.The one saving grace was Rupert Everett , the sassy gay friend . He was a gem and continues to be , even if it was a now somewhat typical role as the gay man companion to a lone strait woman . He was by far the funniest , and displayed the most talent . Cameron Diaz is n't bad either now that I think of it.The ending made me want to puke . After she reviels that she had been behind all the sabbatage , both Cameron and McDermott forgive her ? That 's just ridiculous . I 'd be too ashamed to look at myself in the mirror let alone at anyone else if I were behind all that . This was confirming the notion for women that it 's ok to be irrational , jealous and self centered .	-1
I 'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I 've ever tried to sit through . Do n't be fooled by artsy film snobs , this one is a snoozer . And oh by the way , the tenacious `` loyalty , devotion and integrity '' of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film , is in my opinion , distracting and ridiculous .	-1
`` Excess Baggage '' is the first project of Alicia Silverstone 's First Kiss production company . This tale of a fouled up `` kidnapping '' is definitely lightweight fare , with a minimal amount of substance . Unless you a really a fan of Alicia Silverstone or Benico Del Toro , you may want to pass on this one.Silverstone is Emily , a rich kid neglected by her father . Her plan is to fake her kidnapping , and win Daddy 's affection upon her safe return . He 's involved in some rather shady business deals , and can afford the ransom payment of a million dollars . Emily binds herself with tape , and locks herself in the trunk of her BMW . While waiting to be recovered by the police , the car is stolen by Vincent ( Del Toro ) a professional car thief . From this somewhat interesting premise not a lot happens that is either funny , or exciting.The movie attempts , but does not succeed in creating a warm and romantic relationship between the two leads . Failing to achieve this , we are left with a barely average comedy adventure . Silverstone 's performance does have some charm , and though her character is a bit odd , she rarely becomes irritating . She is a fashion casualty though . Unfortunately the chemistry with Vincent just does n't develop as intended . Vincent mumbles and bumbles , and seems none too bright . You watch him wondering just how weird he actually is . He never offends , but neither does he charm you . It just seems his brain is working in a lower gear most of the time , except when it comes to the subject of serving jail time , which definitely gets his full attention.Chris Walken is Emily 's Uncle Ray , a slick operator with an inflated opinion of himself , who never lives up to the hype . He works for Emily 's father , and has a better relationship with her than her own father . He looks into the kidnapping on his own , providing yet another odd character to watch.The conclusion is as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie . The kidnapping is somehow pinned on others , leaving Vincent in the clear . Though exactly how this is accomplished is never explained . That there is no happy reunion between father and daughter is no real loss . All Vincent 's other troubles have vanished , and he and Emily finish the movie together in the trunk of her car.I wanted to like this movie . With better writing , one could easily see how the `` Vincent '' role could have really been something special , and taken over the movie . Instead he 's just a harmless mumbler . Alicia Silverstone does a competent enough acting job , playing the spoiled misunderstood brat , trying ( sometimes too hard ) to bring out Vincent 's inner charm . It this case , it 's almost a lost cause .	-1
I 'm just tired of movies that have no individuality . They do n't even try to attempt something remotely original , and that seems down into their casting decisions . How many times do we need to see Gary Oldman play a creepy villain ? Honestly , how many times do we need to see Harrison Ford play a Presidential figure of some sort ? Even Glenn Close gets type casted in those ` women who wish they were as powerful as men ' roles . That is the big issue with ` Air Force One ' , there is nothing original here . The story is preposterous and pretty straightforward with no real stimulation . It does n't make a lot of sense and yet it is forgivable action fluff for the most part really . The action scenes are effective and some of the visuals are nicely constructed , but the tension just does n't live up upon multiple viewings , and really with a film this redundant in basically everything it is n't worth watching more than once .	-1
It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie . Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans . Much overacting on almost everyone 's part . Harrison is just horrible . Actually he 's never been very good has he ?	-1
On this derivative , by-the-numbers thriller we are forced to believe that an US president ( played by Harrison Ford ) could actually take down a russian ( what else ? ) group of terrorists , as if he was 007 or McGyver . The beginning of the movie is somewhat credible , but soon presents us with one-dimensional characters and motivations , a lame and predictable plot and wooden , tepid acting . There are some twists , but they are so ridiculous and unbelievable that I stopped caring about it halfway through , given that the resolution has no surprises at all since the & quot ; good & quot ; guys always win . Despite some competent action sequences , this is brain-dead , mind-numbing material , cartoonish at best and completly disposable . There ` s no force to be found here .	-1
This is the kind of movie that should have never gotten to a studio once the script was written . It 's so fake and it would never happen.Harrison Ford is the president and he 's kidnapped aboard his plane by a terrorist Gary Oldman . He 's negotating for the release of some of his comrades to the vice president played by Glen Close . Ford wo n't give up without a fight and he 's determined to save his family and friends without Oldmans plans being met.The movie is so fake it 's sad . The plane would have been destroyed by pressure . It gets laced with 100 's of rounds of ammo . Come on you have to make is somewhat believable . Wolfgang Peterson should be slapped upside the head for putting something like that in a movie.Glen Close is horrible . Her dramatics are over the top . The fact that her character negotiates for the president is stupid . We do n't negotiate with terrorists and the fact that they put that in his dumb . It 's so fake.The refueling plane blowing up is dumb . There are so many saftey devices in place that would never happen like that . You have to mkae a movie at look least real if your trying to make an action drama like this and it 's not.Russia would never give up dangerous men either . They 'd tell us they felt bad for the president being in danger and would tell us to shove are demands where the sun do n't shine.This movie is way to fake . I could n't enjoy it because it would never happen . I enjoy action dramas and this is one of the worst ones I 've ever seen . If they had decided to make this more a drama and not so much action I might have been able to go along with it . The cast is awesome for the movie and a drama could have worked . The cast and talents are wasted . Why this made so much money I do n't know . I guess people are stupid enough to follow the story . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .	-1
The schlockmeisters , from Hollywood , have surpassed themselves with this offering . It needs more than suspension of disbelief to be entertained here , a full-frontal lobotomy is almost a prerequisite.It is so over-the-top and patently absurd in its action sequences that it actually ca n't rate as a movie in the genre of a thriller ; it 's more like a self-parody of an action movie . What 's missing is the canned laughter to give this movie some form of legitimacy and classification as to what the producer had in mind when he dished this up to the public.Yes , every respectable critic has alluded to the spraying of hundreds of rounds machinegun fire inside a pressurised cabin of a 747 , but what we have here is a President who 's a master of armed and unarmed combat ; an Avionics Engineer - a man adept at doing anything in a crisis situation . We can also add : the perfect , caring and reassuring father and husband ; maybe , we can include gynaecologist to his rather impressive list of credentials as well.This guy can hang outside a plane flying at 550mph at 38,000ft in -60 degrees Centigrade - if you 're not impressed with that , we also see him standing upright on the plane 's wing.Gary Oldman has played the arch villain once too often , his acting is becoming banal , predictable and synthetic ; it 's almost as if he does n't believe in his character anymore - he 's simply bored by the monotonous , one-dimensional , stereotyped role of the baddie.As for the role of Glenn Close as V.P . - she should know better . The scenes in the war room with the false sentiments of angst , anticipation , anxiety and , finally , overwhelming relief and joy ... ... it was cringingly awful.Somehow , I ca n't help but think , that those viewers who raved about this movie spend their vacation in the Grand Canyon searching for conclusive proof that the coyote is still chasing after the Roadrunner .	-1
When Russian terrorists posing as a news crew hijack Air Force One , the President himself is forced to save the day . It does n't get much more complex than that , which is a real shame because there was plenty more here to work with : a nice subtext about the politics of terrorism and American foreign policy ; a background power-play between the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense ; and even a conspiracy involving one of the President 's own staff . In the hands of a savvy writer/director like Phil Noyce or Rod Lurie or Michael Mann , this could have been that rarest of beasts - an action-thriller with something to say . Unfortunately , with Wolfgang Petersen at the helm it plays more like an episode of `` Thunderbirds '' . The A-list cast is squandered : Gary Oldman plays another ridiculous villain ; Glenn Close unfortunately reprises her comedic role from `` Mars Attacks ! '' Only Ford is truly convincing . He 's particularly well-cast as President Jim Marshall , because the role requires precisely what Ford can always be relied on to give , in every guise from Jack Ryan to Richard Kimble to Indiana Jones : the slightly fearful , slightly bumbling heroics of an ordinary guy forced to do extraordinary things . He 's great , and the scenes in which he 's fighting for his life in the cargo hold are the movie 's best moments , not least because Petersen 's particular talent seems to be for staging tense action sequences in confined settings . But it 's not enough . The whole picture is ultimately undone by its dogged insistence on taking itself seriously . Andrew W. Marlowe 's script is utterly devoid of humour and contains some memorable clangers : `` I 'm countin ' on you , red white and blue ... '' , and the utterly cringe-worthy , `` GET OFF MY PLANE ! '' . Jerry Goldsmith 's insufferably chipper score , which seems specifically crafted to induce some kind of patriotic swoon , obliterates most of the realism from any scene , and what remains is shot down by the ludicrously inept special effects . One is almost tempted to read film this as Wolfgang Petersen 's tongue-in-cheek Hollywood calling card . `` You want me , a German , to demonstrate my allegiance by making patriotic Hollywood crap ? Sure , I can do that . Just watch me . '' He certainly knows his market . Never ones to demand any connection between the Presidency and reality , locals coughed up close to $ 200m for this - which is hilarious until you remember they vote .	-1
You take an once great martial-arts actor , adds a basketball player who seems to be destroying his sports career by his own freewill , takes another actor who , by his own freewill , almos destroyed his own face going prize fighting ( Rourke ) , then apparently takes a six-year old kid to write a script , and you have as result this & quot ; movie & quot ; .	-1
This Van Damme thriller is such a mixed bag that it 's hard to know where to begin . The plot is truly a witches ' brew of ideas apparently cobbled together from just about every action thriller I 've seen in the past 20 years . That would n't be so bad , except that the original movies did it better and this movie suffers by comparison . The script is n't terrible , but it 's far from stellar . The actors struggle valiantly to extract some inspiration and drama from it , and sometimes succeed . I note one reviewer says this movie is on his top 10 worst list , and if it were n't for the unintentionally funny parts like former pro-basketball star Dennis Rodman throwing bad guys through windows 10 feet high as if he were dunking a basketball I probably would n't have watched the whole thing . But Rodman as an exotic arms dealer and Mickey Rourke as the evil Euro-nasty are entertaining to watch , and Van Damme is impressive as usual with the martial arts stunts . But if there 's anything else on the tube rated three stars or higher you might want to switch channels .	-1
All three major Irish dance films suffer from the inability of whoever is doing the filming to film dance properly ! This is the greatest abuser of the three . There are three major problems : 1 ) not filming the dancers full body , 2 ) stage lighting ( not the best for filming , though fine for viewing a live performance ) , and 3 ) excessive changes in camera angle . Of these three , the second is forgiveable , being unavoidable if one is filming before a live audience but one and three are not ! As to one , there was extensive work done by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly in the early days of the musical that worked out the best ways to film dance . Only one completely ignorant of filming technique would fail to film full body . As for three , I can tell you that there are nine cameras in New York 's Radio City Music Hall . How do I know ? BECAUSE THE FILMOGRAPHER SWITCHED CAMERAS EVERY 10-15 SECONDS OF EVERY FLIPPING DANCE ! HELLO , we do not ALL watch an excessive quantities of MTV , thank you very much ! This is distracting at best and at worst it totally disrupts the ability to appreciate the flow of the movement . Additionally , if you 've already seen the Michael Flatley film there is very little of interest or improvement ( unless you dislike his work , in which case you may like this ) . The only major change is a & quot ; dance down & quot ; pitting American tap against Irish step . This particular number , were it film properly , would be worth the price of adding this work to your collection , even if it already included the original & quot ; Riverdance & quot ; , but , as it is , forget it ! Rent it on video , see the number , and forget wasting you well-earned money on this forgetable turkey . The performers worked hard and I am sorry that those filming them did n't give their effort the presentation it deserved .	-1
I saw this film on the new release shelf . Vincent D'Onofrio , Salma Hayek . Looks quirky and fun . It 's not . First of all , the most interesting character is killed off in one of the first scenes . Then , we are left with the other characters moping around and making out . I found it hard to distinguish any story at all , and by the last reel , the film made me wanting to take a shower , badly .	-1
too esoteric for me	-1
A great sci-fi movie but this is a terrible transfer ( there was apparently no attempt to clean up the master before the transfer to HD ) ; my Superbit version of the movie upscaled by my Blu-Ray player looks much , much better.Sony will be releasing an new version with better picture quality sometime soon ; they are also working on a program to trade in this poor version for some kind of credit/refund when you buy the new one .	-1
I found this movie to be a deadly bore ... I had to watch it in a biology classUma Thurman is gorgeous in this film	-1
This film has lots going for it - a fine soundtrack ( Michael Nyman ) , some interesting sets , even Uma Thurman . . . But it is fantastically dull.The basic premise , outlined in detail elsewhere , has been far more entertainingly explored in films like Blade Runner , and 'The Boys from Brazil'.If you 're seeking some intelligent dystopia , try 'Brazil ' - or if you 're really highbrow , read 'The Man in the High Castle ' , or 'Brave New World'.I hate to slag off a film that has so much going for it ( it is good to see Alan Arkin and Gore Vidal up there on the silver screen ) , but to be honest , I found this lacking in any depth whatsoever . I can hear the groans from here , but I found 'Paycheck ' a lot more thought-provoking . . .	-1
Some information in the `` Product Details '' section for the non-Superbit DVD release of `` Gattaca '' may cause confusion as to whether this issue includes a widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) presentation . The `` Format '' section lists the available presentation as `` Full Screen '' ( i.e . `` Pan & Scan '' for any widescreen theatrical movie ) , while the `` Aspect Ratio '' section lists a 2.35:1 ( widescreen ) aspect ratio . To clear things up , the theatrical presentation is widescreen ( 2.35:1 ) , but the DVD presentation is pan & scan ( 1.33:1 ) , not widescreen . It says so on the back of the DVD case cover insert . The Superbit DVD release of `` Gattaca '' includes a widescreen presentation at a heftier price .	-1
I 'm writing this review mainly to tell everyone who is n't in love with Brad Pitt that this movie was good at all . I felt as if I 'd spent seven years somewhere during this movie , seven years somewhere boring . The movie had about as much plot as pigs have wings . The movie centers around Brad Pitt 's character who is neither likable or really that interesting . His relationship with the Dalai Lama in this movie which was originally what the studios used to sell this movie is barely a sideline . The movie was so bad that Battlefeild Earth looks like Star Wars in comparison . I hope all you ladies out there wo n't drop your ... to see yet another Brad Pitt washout . If you REALLY want to see Brad Pitt by Legends of the Fall or Fight Club now those two movies were excellent .	-1
Some movies are just bad . Like , there is nothing redeeming about them , they are just outright bad . ` Striking Distance ' is one of those movies . The script is ridiculous , preposterous and clich & eacute ; d. The acting is terrible from everyone on board and the action , while suitable , is nothing of particular note . From opening sequence to closing kiss , this movie is just BAD.It 's a shame , because I tend to like the cast , or at least parts of it , and Willis , while gravitating towards tired cop thrillers in the early stages of his career , was able to bring an intensity and freshness to most of them . Not this one though . From his melodramatic performance to Brion James nauseating presence to the screenplays consistent stupidity ( from the actions of the police officers to the unraveling of the plot to the tacked on love interest ) , ` Striking Distance ' is one of the worst films this genre has ever offered us . Robert Pastorelli camps it up beyond belief in a performance I ca n't really even describe , it is that bad.I do n't want to spoil the film for any of you who actually want to see this , but I do n't think I 'll ever be able to take a film seriously that can not even attempt to give the characters an ounce of professionalism . The police force as a whole is portrayed as a group of no-brained , conscienceless scoundrels who are as dumb as they are cruel . The turnabout that these characters undergo at the end , especially Farina 's character ( like , now you care ? And why exactly ? What is so different about what he 's doing now and what he 's already done ? ) makes no sense at all.That 's this film 's biggest problem , it just makes no sense , does n't try to fails to do anything worth remembering .	-1
In my book , the very worst films are the ones that take a lot of talented people , all of whom have done great work elsewhere , and deliver them into a cinematic meatgrinder . `` Battlefield Earth '' is one such film , and `` Striking Distance '' is another.This film manages to completely waste Bruce Willis , Sarah Jessica Parker , Dennis Farina , Tom Sizemore , Robert Pastorelli , Brion James , and Andre Braugher , all of whom are tremendous actors who 've done fine work elsewhere . But in `` Striking Distance , '' it seems that they were all in it for a paycheck , and little else.When bad movies are filled with hack actors , and were obviously done on a nonexistent budget , at least you know the movie could n't have been better.But when you have a bomb like this populated with this kind of talent , and obviously the product of a serious budget , the problem is that the people making it just did n't give a darn .	-1
C'mon , guys ! ! ! This is the age of DVD & quot ; extra-mania & quot ; with every sort of outtake , alternate scene , missing scene , lost scene , director 's cut , , etc etc being an ESSENTIAL part of a film 's legacy as preserved in the DVD format.In the case of the moving and powerful & quot ; Requiem & quot ; ( and I agree with the customer who feels that the Jackie Gleason/Julie Harris staircase scene belongs at the top of the all-time list of great movie scenes ) , the film was obviously released in several different versions.The confusion begins , in fact , immediately after the staircase scene . There are AT LEAST THREE SCENES from the latter part of the film that are NOT INCLUDED on the DVD:1 . ) Gleason 's encounter with the vile Ma Greeny in the hallway when he tells her he 'd & quot ; like to run into her when you 're not grafted to that torpedo ... & quot ; ( referring to her big thug/bodyguard ) .2 . ) A lengthy ( and painful ) scene where Quinn is training to be a wrestler , and the moronic Pirelli ( Stan Adams , the only actor to reprise his role from the 1956 TV original version ) signals Quinn 's wrestling partner to intentionally gouge his bad eye , whereupon Quinn beats the crap out of the guy ... ..3 . ) Gleason 's final speech on the rotten world of Prize Fighting which he delivers to the young wanna-be ... ..If Serling ultimately wanted these scenes cut , WHY IN THE WORLD were they ot included as EXTRAS ? ? ? I have old video copies of late-night , local TV airings of this film that are FAR MORE COMPLETE than this state-of-the-art DVD release.What a pity -- -to see such a cool film treated so poorly ( the audio is also very low on this disc ; I had to jack the TV volume all the way up to get a decent signal ) .	-1

Little more than an excuse to exploit the success of the Spice Girls , Spice World is a grossly lacking film , even for those who enjoy the music . Essentially a ripoff of The Beatles `` A Hard Days Night '' , the Spice Girls are unfortunately not nearly as famous and their music not nearly as universally recognized . A slew of cameos and familiar supporting cast members ca n't save the film from its own bad dialogue , poor choreography and painful lip-syncing . Apparently everyone was in it for the paycheck.Piers Cuthbertson-Smyth ( Alan Cumming ) is a documentarian desperately trying to obtain footage for his latest project , a look at the popular five-girl singing group The Spice Girls : Ginger ( Geri Halliwell ) , Baby ( Emma Bunton ) , Posh ( Victoria Beckham ) , Sporty ( Melanie Chisholm ) and Scary ( Melanie Brown ) . While he struggles to sneak into parties and onto sets where they practice , the girls themselves prepare for a big stage show in England . Meanwhile , their eccentric manager is in cahoots with Chief ( Roger Moore ) the man who feels he is responsible for their success and can take it away with a snap of his fingers , or a caress of his squealing bovine . And if that is n't enough , a mysterious paparazzi spy gets carried away snapping pictures of the fivesome and pasting it all over the headlines . To top it all off , a pair of filmmakers pitch their idea of a Spice Girl movie to studio executives , which as it turns out , is basically the very movie we 're watching.Since the story of the film is largely pointless , and little else really holds attention spans , it is easy to pick out inaccuracies and bits of concepts that do n't quite add up . For starters , the girls drive around in the Spice Bus , a blue and red monstrosity that has an impossibly large interior . So impossibly large in fact , that it does n't even pretend to make sense . Workout equipment , couches , beds and all sorts of other furniture are scattered throughout the inside of the bus , in shots that are clearly not capable of being inside the bus . And yet the filmmakers go so far as to show the flashing lights of other vehicles zipping by the bus windows , even though the realism has long since been abandoned.While each Spice Girl physically embodies stereotypical fashions , physiques and attitudes , those characteristics do n't translate over to their personalities . Either they were all scripted to be ditzy , or they 're just naturally that way . Through constant daydream sequences they act out various scenarios , most of which are intended as comedy relief , despite the blatant absence of humor . Similarly , the dance and song segments arise from nonsensical situations , and they 're choreographed with little self-respect , and with obnoxious elements such as an Army dance instructor and poor lip-syncing . Alan Cumming plays a character very much like we envision him to be in his everyday life , and Roger Moore embarrassingly plays a villain who strokes various furry animals and speaks in riddles , an obvious farce of his own James Bond evildoers.With brief appearances by Elton John , Bob Hoskins and other well-known Brits , a wholeheartedly unexciting speedboat adventure , and countless attempts at failed humor , Spice World is still unable to create entertainment that reaches beyond diehard fans of the all-girl group . And even entertaining those fans is debatable . When the group revives an unconscious sick kid by suggesting that Ginger Spice take her top off , it 's apparent that their true talents are not in the music.- Mike Massie	-1
This is not so spicy as the groups music is . I love the Spice Girls music but when I saw Spice World ... I thouht that I may not even LISTEN to them no more much less WATCH them . This movie , while being spicy and sorta on the verge , was not what I expected . When I saw it in theathers I though it was a really good movie . So good that I ACTURALLY bought the movie on VHS and then updated to DVD . I watched it on VHS and it was okay but when I popped in the DVD ... it lost it 's magic . First off ... a few things where wrong with the dvd.1 . ) Quality - The picture was great . Clear and perfect . The only problem with the picture was it was too dark to even see who was who.2 . ) Music - Could n't they had put more felling into the music and acturally , I do n't know , sing for once . I know you lip-sing in music videos but , if you really want to get the crowd going and yelling for a sequel or another Spice movie , just sing and do n't be scared and stupid as lets say , Britney Spears is.3 . ) Special Feautures - There were only 2 special features on the disc at all . People usually upgrade to DVD 's for the special features . Am I right ? ? Of course I Am ! This movie , while being sporty and spicy , this is not a movie I would recommend you upgrade to DVD . If you have the VHS ... keep it . Do n't upgrade to the DVD . Your just wasting your money ! Read my other DVD reviews and listen to my advice . It 's the best on this website !	-1
Love the story , not the cussing.Was a little disappointed , had to get rid of it.Ca n't they make movies with out using Gods name every time .	-1
I 've seen this movie . Even with Tom Hanks , Jon Lovitz and Geena Davis staring in it . I just could n't enjoyed it . I found that both Madonna 's character and Rosie O'Donnell 's character were just flat awful . It took away from the movie , itself .	-1
My husband needed this for his writing class that is the only reason it was purchased . I would never ever allow any children to watch this movie or even listen to it . Hollywood and the child actors ' seems to ruin these young actors ' with filth like this . This will never be watched by any children , teenagers or even adults in my home . It is just that horrible . I was shocked to hear their mouths and see the characters in action . It is an insult to those who have and hold morals .	-1

Viewed : 9/12Rate : 19/12 : If you need a reason to proclaim that Chick Flicks Suck , look no further than Stool Boognolias . Clearly , the film is among the worst of the genre . Instead of one , there are six prima donnas in the cast : Julia Roberts , Olympia Dukakis , Sally Field , Dolly Parton , Daryl Hannah , and Shirley MacLaine . Every one of them has a string behind their backs , and each pull will have them screaming , `` Look at me ! Look at me ! I am the Queen of the South ! '' again , again , and again . It literally is that the entire film . The six Amanda Wingfields are thoroughly theatrical as they can possibly be , further ruining the film . Really , this Disease Movie of the Week Stool Boognolias is a rip-off from Terms of Endearment which is the better film by a mile . The whole storyline is conceptually the same as the other film with the same predictable ending . Of the cast , Daryl Hannah looks completely ridiculous and shows why she has no business acting in the first place . Dolly Parton , wow ... she became famous for one and only one thing , and it was not even her singing . Sally Field , she has done better in other films . Olympia Dukakis , she is like , `` Look at me ! I am Ol-l-l-y-y-y-m-m-p-i-i-i-a Duk-ak-i-i-i-i-s ! '' Ah , Shirley MacLaine ... I 've always hated her since she first appeared on The Trouble With Harry . I wo n't be surprised that she slept her way into Hollywood . No acting talent either . Finally , the worst of the worst ( well , Shirley is really the worst ) , Julia Roberts nabs the nomination with her `` I can make puffy faces and cry on cue ! '' and `` This is ABOUT ME ! DAMN IT ! '' Horrible ... horrible ... horrible . Above all is the strong misguided feminist message the movie sends out to the audience . Uh , that 's called `` brainwashing . '' All in all , I hate Stool Boognolias and , more importantly , its cast of six prima donnas with passion .	-1
People tell me I am the spitting image of a young Robert Redford so I usually go out of my way for his movies . This one did n't have much substance , though . It 's about a baseball player in the 1800 's that is shot in the chest by a stray bullet and continues to play in a baseball game . Due to an electrical failure and a defective baseball , the game is halted and his team is granted the win to much fanfare . There is also a subplot with some woman ... possibly a lukewarm love affair . I did not pay much mind to those parts so I ca n't recall every detail of it .	-1
The Bottom Line : A baseball movie that knows nothing about the sport ( Roy Hobbs is a pitcher the first time we see him and , inexplicably , a slugging right fielder the next time he 's on screen ) and attempts to impose a larger-than-life mythological feel on a simple story that manifestly can not support it , The Natural is an overlong , overrated , and unenjoyable film that did n't even have the guts to follow its source novel to the dark conclusion the plot warrants.2/4	-1
God love Terry Gilliam : a brilliant moviemaker and animator whose heart is always in the right place . Terry intended this as a homage/tribute to the brilliant Czech animator Karel Zeman , whose earlier version of the Munchausen fable is still the definitive one . This version , though well-meant , is done in by too much budget and too many 'Spot-The-Star ' moments . Anybody looking to really exercise that 'sense-of-wonder ' should hunt down Zeman 's version : despite its poor characterizations , mainly post-synch sound and general narrative torpor , it 's truly unforgettable and the reason Gilliam became an animator in the first place . Though Gilliam 's 'Baron ' is clever and generally watchable , it too suffers from narrative torpor - which is harder to excuse with a $ 40- million budget .	-1
I had been wanting to see this movie for the past two years , and I finally got the chance . Surprisingly , I found it to be a real letdown . It focuses on the life of a teenage girl named Dedee , who visits her half-brother in Indiana , after her stepfather dies . Soon upon arrival , she seduces her brother 's gay live-in lover , then later tells him that she is pregnant with his child . From that point on , Dedee spreads bad luck to those around her . Even though some of the actors/actresses played their roles very well , I did not like the flow of the movie . Overall , I thought that it was pretty boring , and I did not like it .	-1
`` American Pop '' is Ralph Bakshi 's best film ... that 's not saying much considering this man also assaulted us with `` Fritz the Cat , '' the animated `` The Lord of the Rings , '' `` Wizards , '' and the really awful `` Hey Good Lookin ' . `` The story follows four generations of a Russian immigrant family , and their cosmic involvement in their respective worlds of popular music . Jimmy is a vaudevillian who gets shot in the throat in WWI and must manage the career of his singer wife . He also gets involved with the mob thanks to prohibition . His son , Benny , is a piano genius who is killed is WWII . Benny 's son is the misfit Tony , who we follow from the Beat generation to a drug induced 1970 's . Tony 's one night stand product , Pete , continues the drug trade , but can belt out one mean tune in the punk rock late 1970's.Bakshi 's animation still consists of tracing live action onto film as animated subjects . This makes for some really jerky scenes , although not on the headache inducing level of his earlier work . There are a few places where the work is downright interesting , like Tony 's acid trip and eventual fall from a stage , and Pete 's dancelike movements as he delivers his drugs to his customers.Bakshi 's biggest mistake is using well known songs in the soundtrack , and attributing them to cartoon characters . Pete writes `` Night Moves . '' Benny comes up with `` As Time Goes By '' after stealing the riff from a hobo . Tony wrote `` Somebody to Love . '' I found this angle of the film irritating . It is not like no one has ever heard of these songs , and would be fooled . It just seems as if the film makers were too lazy to come up with their own material , and the songwriters and publishing houses were too eager to sell their stuff for a quick buck . Since the entire film consists of this one family coming up with all the great songs of the last eighty years , toss any suspense out the window as to what each generation is going to accomplish.Bakshi is also obsessed with the illegal drug culture in the final half of the film . What is this , `` Panic in Needle Park '' ? Watching cartoon characters shooting heroin is bizarre , but pointless . I ask the same question I ask of some of Bakshi 's other work , specifically `` Hey Good Lookin ' , '' why did he animate this ? Why did n't he shoot this with live actors ? The animation , while interesting , is completely unwarranted.In the end , `` American Pop '' is as homogenized and half baked as much of the music coming out today . Then again , I 'd rather watch Britney Spears cavort in low riding jeans than sit through this music mondo mockumentary again . `` American Pop '' has left the building , do n't bring it back next year.This is animated , but rated ( R ) for physical violence , strong gun violence , gore , profanity , brief female nudity , sexual references , strong drug abuse , and strong drug references .	-1
The animation is good , especially considering when it was made , but & quot ; American Pop & quot ; is never quite successful . Once again Bakshi probes the sordid underbelly of his subject , in this case pop music , but nothing here ever comes off quite convincing enough . And his dismissal of punk and rush to embrace the bland beardo post-hippie commercial rock of Bob Seger and Heart betrays Bakshi 's age , and maybe a lack of good taste as well . It comes off a bit old-fogeyish.Like a lot of Bakshi 's work , this has to be taken as it is , and the viewer has to bear in mind when and how it was made . Computer animation was in its infancy , and animation was at a low point in the United States , so the fact that this was made and distributed in mainstream theaters at all was a minor miracle at the time.In short , the musical spots provide the bright moments , but the plot is labored and the characters , particularly the ridiculous & quot ; rock star & quot ; he invents at the end of the film , are unconvincing . As a historical document of where animation was in the United States at the time , it 's viewable ; as entertainment , well , it 's better than & quot ; Heavy Traffic & quot ; but certainly not any kind of a classic animated film . See it if you want , but it 's not indispensable .	-1
No Mercy is one of those films that is not really that bad , but it leaves you wondering how did they get big stars to do it . In the film Richard Gere plays a tough New York cop with a drinking habit , an ex-wife , and a bad rep . So what happens to him ? Well his good natured partner ( you know the one with the with the wife and kids and a good reputation a.k.a has everything to lose ) gets murdered when Gere takes a tip from a local hood that a hit is about to go down . So the film turns into the rouge cop on the revenge trail story . This will bring him to New Oreans ( that whole & quot ; fish-out-of-water & quot ; thing ) , and to Kim Basinger . Along the way Gere will encounter lots of bad guys , bullets , cops who do n't like him , swamps , crawfish , and cajons ( sp ? ) all to a hip 80 's soundtrack.This film was the first pairing of Richard Gere and Kim Basinger together and to it 's credit it is better than there second film , Final Analysis . However there really is n't much going on here . The plot was as predictable as traffic at five o'clock . Neither Gere nor Basinger is very good which is Richard Pearce 's ( the director ) fault because they fall in and out of their accents . I have to say though there is something about Richard Gere that even in his weaker films , like this one , he is still fun to watch . The same can be said for Basinger who is always delightful on the eyes even when she is hard on the ears.This film has it 's momments , but they are pretty sparse . Maybe Richard and Kim will get it right on the third try since they seem to like doing this type of film together . If you 're out there looking for some steamy action you might want to look elsewhere .	-1
Vincent Gallo is strange . The characters here are all strange . Kevin Pollack is interesting and surprising and you will feel genuine sympathy for his wife . Kiefer Sutherland is not interesting or surprising , and you will get tired of him quickly , just like everyone else in the film . Predictable film and all too long for me .	-1
The Juror starring Demi Moore and Alec Baldwin looked like such an entertaining thriller but this movie is just so stupid . I could n't believe how dumb the plot and ending was . And who the hell what 's to see Anne Heche naked ? not me ! One of the worst movies I have ever seen , use this one as a coaster .	-1
You see this a lot . A sci-fi movie ( or rather direct to video release ) comes along with a very compelling premise and even an interesting plot , but in the end fails to meet the expectations set by what makes the idea so great in the first place . I watch Screamers and I see a fascinating idea from the events unfolding in the movie . However by the time the movie ends I have to ask myself , `` there has to be a way to do this better ... much better . '' This is pretty much where Screamers sits . Good stuff mired in not so good stuff.What 's good about Screamers ? It 's based on the short story , Second Variety by Philip K Dick , which itself has been named a very influencial and critically acclaimed writing . So the background story is this : A corporation and their previous employees wage war on each other on a planet based on disputes over how to reclaim some valuable resources . The ex-workers , who named themselves The Alliance , created intuative robots to help in the fights . Eventually the robots end up wiping out both sides until there is hardly anybody left . Not a bad start . The film is essentially about a group of Alliance soldiers making their way to a company outpost to hammer out a truce , but those pesky robots ( called Screamers ) have their own plans . Most of the major plot points from that premise are rock solid on paper , and would make for some really cool scenes . However ... ... on to the bad about Screamers . As good an idea as the plot if you ca n't take the viewer there and get them to really absorb what 's going on then your film will fall flat . This is what happens . We get to a rather interesting and major plot twist that wraps up pretty much what the movie is about , but you would n't know it by seeing those scenes . It just moves with the kind of pacing you would expect from a scene with little importance to the plot . That how most of the scenes feel . Just a little exposition or action that does n't feel tied to the story . Characters come up as one dimensional with rather pointless traits that do n't lead anywhere . Some twists seem to come out to build suspense but really feel like they were dropped into the story with very little to allow them to make any sense . So a great idea is held back by poor planning in both the script and direction.As far as the technical side of the film is concerned I really have little to complain about considering this is likely a low budget release . The sets range from impressive to quite believeable . The post apocalyptic look is consistent . The special effects are serviceable too . I liked the stop motion animation work they used and was impressed by how well it blended with the rest of the film . The violence end of the special efffects work pretty well without getting into the gory side of things . Acting ... well I ca n't complain . Good actors do good and some actors overact , but sometimes I have to defer that to how the director leads them.The DVD is pretty bare bones with just a movie trailer and language options as your extras . The picture was clean , but I have an issue with the 5.1 dolby digial audio . It just seems the dialog took a major back seat to the surround audio effects and explosions . More than once I had to turn up the volume just to hear the mumblings of the actors only to turn it down again because some robot is screaming ( guess why the movie is titled such ? ) or some other audio queue comes blaring out much louder than normal . As low a rating I give to this film I still think die hard sci-fi fans should at least give it a rental so they can at least ponder what the movie was trying to accomplish . The rest you may want to go ahead and give this one a pass . It 's not scary or gory enough for horror and suspense fans . It 's not intense enough for action junkies .	-1
First off , Robert DeNiro as the monster . I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone . They did n't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York . Second , Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with the set that he forgot about story . Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous . Frankenstien 's shock that she 's not happy to be back -- burnt up , cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest -- was supposed to be touching but I laughed . We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really , really , really bad.I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn 's face .	-1
With the exception of Campbell Scott ` s convincing acting , this movie has little or nothing to offer . This is supposed to be a suspenseful mistery about what people seem to be and what they really are , a subject that is presented in most of director David Mamet ` s films . However , the plot is contrived at best , the pacing drags endlessly and the characters are just tepid and souless , excepting the lead that somewhat makes the viewer care a bit . The acting is also far from excellent and the direction does nothing to improve the slowness of the movie . The plot twists are quite irrelevant too , since the story is so uninteresting . & quot ; The Spanish Prisoner & quot ; is just another forgettable and useless movie about cons and burglars , and it ` s as bad as & quot ; Heist & quot ; , another Mamet film that goes nowhere and also fails to engage.A good one to ignore .	-1
Casting against type can be very effective . Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity is a good example . Raymond Burr in Rear Window is another . Steve Martin as a heavy is not . Two things that never below together in any film : Steve Martin , and a gun.And Martin 's the best thing about this film .	-1
Nothing about this movie works.Dialogue : About five minutes into this film , I realized that the bad dialogue and horrible delivery was intentional . It was too consistent . ALL the characters used odd turns of phrases and words more commonly found in print than spoken aloud . That 's OK when you do it convincingly ( hardly ever in real life do I hear someone yell `` YOU SHALL NOT PASS ! ! ! ! '' but in a fantasy film , it works ) . When you do it without conviction or use it as a lame attempt to immitate 1940 's film noir , it just sounds stupid.Plot : Plot holes you can drive a truck through abound in this film . Biggest and most obvious is `` why go to all the bother of tricking someone into doing something when you could have just stuck a gun in his back and forced him to do it ? '' Just about every element of this ridiculous ruse has the same problem : They all rely on `` chance '' occurances that could n't reasonably be arranged to happen . From step one ( the sea plane landing ) to the final act ( the pseudo-japanese tourists being on exactly the right water taxi out of hundreds of others ) , the audience is asked to believe that these staged coincidences are possible . They 're not , and so the film becomes unconvincing from start to finish.Setting : Is it 1940 's film noir ? Is it the 90 's ? Is this some sort of Jimmy Buffet island theme mystery gone sour ? Hard to tell . Oddly enough , it almost appears intentionally so . The potential gains from the formula are written on a blackboard but not shown to the audience . Phones look modern ( for the 1990 's ) , but you still have secretaries dialing for execs . I 'm not sure when `` get me [ name here ] on the phone , Dolores '' went out of style , but it was definitely before the 90's.Costuming : so/so . No real issues here , other than it 's a little ambiguous.Cinematography : My biggest beef . If you 're going to do a 1940 's film noir knock-off , film it in grainy B & W ; or at least work the camera angles better . L.A. Story et alia do a much better job of evoking the period and the genre . There were a few half-hearted attempts ( the focus on the sunshine bakery bag , for example ) , but none accomplished much more than making me wonder why they bothered.Misc : - The use of the carousel was an obvious nod to The Sting . Unfortunately , this movie had none of the campy believability of that classic.- The female lead was a bad pick . Steve Martin made a decent attempt to carry the bad dialogue , but she just cranked out each monotone wooden line one after the other as if people anywhere or anywhen had actually spoken in that fashion . It would be hard for one actress to ruin a film , but she gives it an old college try.- The lead character makes a big deal over the fact that his formula is locked in a safe- but then leaves it scribbled on a blackboard covered only with a curtain .	-1
There are some enjoyable scenes . Steve Martin is very good . Unfortunately the movie is frustrating and extremely manipulative . In the end you feel used and abused .	-1
Not having seen all of Mamet 's film 's it would be unfair to say he 's made only two good ones : `` House of Games '' and , especially , `` The Winslow Boy '' . We just watched an intermittently interesting but ultimately mediocre Mamet effort , `` Heist '' , so I went to Amazon.com to read some reviewers ' opinions . The awarding of stars was more evenly divided than any set of reviews for any film I 've checked . More interesting than that , however , was the fact that so many reviewers of `` Heist '' mentioned `` The Spanish Prisoner '' as an example of Mamet 's better work . We have seen `` The Spanish Prisoner '' twice , the second time to try to find something that we might have missed the first time . Still do n't get it . It is surface only , and an uninteresting surface at that . There 's no apparent involvement on the part of the players/characters and little or no reason for the viewer to become involved either . The one extra star above the minimum merely means it was n't offensive enough to hate .	-1
Minnie Driver is horribly miscast as the lead in this film , in as much as her on-screen appearance is neither friendly , nor inviting ( in the future she should also shy away from anything that involves her getting ` wet ' argh ! -I ca n't Even imagine watching `` Hard Rain '' ) . As the Annabella Sciorras , and the Emma Thompsons before her , Ms. Driver will have to quickly accept the fact that she has little to offer in a role that is supposed to ` carry ' a film . She just has not the acting skills , nor the on-screen magic that someone like Kate Winslet or Gwyneth Paltrow has , nor has she the energy or effervescence that , say Rose McGowan has.I grabbed the film for Tom Wilkinson anyway , having recently become quite the fan of this British J.T . Walsh . A wonderful character actor who has raised his profile in the US significantly of late with appearances in `` Shakespeare in Love '' , `` The Full Monty '' , and `` Sense and Sensibility '' .The story fails even the Driver-factor , ambling on like one of those scripts developed in a screen-writing class : ` who has an idea ? ' ` how about a young Jewess loses her money and has to take on work in Scotland in the 1800s ' ` good , but we need some conflict in the first act ' ... 'maybe she falls for the master of the house , but the son has eyes for her as well ' ... 'good ' ... you know the rest.And it goes from bad to worse . It 's impossible to complete this puzzle with so many ill-fitting pieces .	-1
I was very interested in seeing `` The Governess '' and fairly lept at the opportunity to do so when my friend Marion suggested it . What a disappointment ! Have n't been so let down since `` Murder on the Orient Express '' as a child.What 's the matter ? The major problem is that there 's just too much crammed into the movie as plot devices . Why not deal with just a few circumstances , than have all this tumult which in the end , does n't even signify ? Interesting premise in a nutshell description : A 19th century Jewish woman must conceal her religion as she takes up a governess position . That 's how it was presented , and frankly , that 's enough . No , how about her father gets murdered in the street ! Well , that was shocking , but what of it ? It never got solved , it never figured in the rest of the movie . I mean , he could have just , you know , died . Why murdered ? Then she goes off to the dreariest place in all of Scotland . The master of the house keeps trying to make early photographs . The Governess takes it upon herself to solve his problems developing film by dumping salt in his solutions . Hey what do you know , he evidently gets credited as the inventor of the photograph , when it was really The Governess . Well , what about that ? Could n't that be a good feminist statement in and of itself ? No , let 's begin a torrid , somewhat unmotivated affair . Then she takes nude photos of him for a change . Uh-oh , that 's the limit , too vulnerable a position for a man . Finally , she 's off to London again as a photographer in her own right , and guess who walks into the salon ... ? Enough already.I just found it more preposterous as it went on . I was more than willing to accept some off-the-beaten-track developments , but this was aimless messing about . No motivation or follow-through.Take a lesson from me ; avoid `` The Governess '' .	-1
Another movie about a young girl ( a servant ) who moves into a rich British family 's house and messes around with the husband ( and the son ) . Nothing original or emotional about it . Just gratuitous sex . Once again , just like several other movies I have seen , this is a movie about a British girl who 's dad dies and she has to go to work to help the family . So that is how she ends up with the rich British family to begin with . But the twist ( and the reason I gave it one star . . . if I could have given it a minus star I would have ) is that this girl is a Jewish girl from a Jewish family in London . She knows from the job advertisement that the family is very religiously Christian . And she fakes being a Christian to get the job . Besides that offensive part of the plot she sees a crucifix of Christ several times and tosses it aside with her disdain or looks it with disdain . It is a very offensive movie . I would tell you the end but this is a review . Besides given the subject matter and this being a Hollywood produced film I am sure you can guess the ending .	-1
As a big Hartley fan , I tried hard to like this , but after about an hour , I just could n't continue . Unlike some of his other films , which are slightly excruciating in their pace but wo n't let you turn away , at some point , I just stopped caring about this one , and decided to give it fast forward help . There were no great insights though , or descriptive genius . It was just too long , and not as creative .	-1
Checked this out after reading a review & I tried but could n't watch it . It 's like watching bad theatre in a town where they have n't seen the good stuff.Apparently I forgot this poor experience & rented it ... Again ! Know the feeling ? I found myself watching the main actor . I was thinking , I hate this actor . Where have I seen him before ? Worse , in spite of oditties ( it was n't so odd or bizarre to me , just bad ) there seem never to be any insides to any of the characters.Checked IMDB & finally realised that I had made this mistake once before.Awful , boring , & irritating do not an art film make . It 's cheesy with some better than average cinematic values attached.However , as I always say in these weird grey areas , beauty is in the eye of the beholder . Something clicks for you here , God Bless .	-1
The musical performances given by `` The Dream Cast '' in this DVD ( 1998 ) of the concert version of the musical , Les Mis & eacute ; rables , are excellent . From full psyche to vigorous diaphragm , from single drum beat to entire chorus , and all the soloists in between , the theme of power as well as the sub-themes composed into this drama are very well done . This accounts for the audience response and overall effect . There are some weak spots in the lyrics however . Now , just to mention some ways in which Victor Hugo 's important work is distorted ? His descriptions of post-Napoleonic France are Rembrandt-like in their line and contrast ( light and dark ) , meaning and depth . The only aspects of the scenery that even approach this are the trench coat worn by Jean Valjean ( Colm Wilkinson ) and the graphic of the ragged child used with the title . Also the plight of Cosette ( Ruthie Henshall ) at the inn , as originally drawn , would n't be any opportunity for comic relief.Further , it seems the emphasis got shifted so that this version of `` Les Mis '' substantiates the opposite of values so intensely put forward in the novel.The principle of man as microcosm is lost and becomes the ideology of the community over the individual .	-1
This was a truly strange movie , from multiple perspectives . Firstly that Francis Ford Coppola would choose something like a pseudo romantic comedy to add to his resume . Secondly that Nicholas Cage would star as the male lead , when he was known before as being the dingbat bumbling fool and after as the brooding dark eccentric . And third , the whole premise of the movie was just plain odd.Kathleen Turner plays Peggy Sue , a divorced , middle aged and unhappy woman who goes to her high school reunion despite all her misgivings . At the reunion she faints , then wakes up back in time . She is once again in high school . She is given a chance to do it all over again.The foundation of this movie was not odd , as it 's been the theme of many sci fi and fantasy films past and present . There are a few funny moments with the typical fish out of water / anachronism humor ( I also remembered going to my high school reunion and remarking that a lot of things they taught were so useless - You did n't take Honors English last year so you have to stay in the Special Ed English class ! - You ca n't have study hall ! Gym class is priority ! - Take the science elective or you wo n't get into college ! , etc. ) . She starts off the movie saying that had she known then what she knows now , she would have done things much differently . We all think that at one point or another . And she does do some things differently , like going for the mysterious poet she always admired from afar . But , she does n't do things differently in the end . She is approached by the school nerd who would grow up to be a wealthy and successful man , and when he proposes that she change her destiny and marry him , she refuses . Peggy Sue said she wanted to go back to the present because she missed her kids . Missed her kids ? ! If she stayed in this time or went with someone else her kids would n't exist ! She ends up with her husband , perhaps because of this reason , and essentially continues back down the same path.That was a disappointment , a major disappointment . She goes back in time and does n't affect the future in a positive way , except to afirm to herself that she is content being miserable in the present . And how about that weird scene with her grandparents and trying to send her back in time at the Shriners ' convention ? Too stupid for words . The best part of this movie was Nicholas Cage , in that it would spring board him into other roles and a successful movie career . Otherwise do n't waste your time .	-1
This film had one good intention : a decent cast . It lacked direction , however , and seemed to be adrift in a sea of identity confusion . Is it a thriller ? Not quite . Is it a `` buddy '' film . Well , not really . It it a romance ? Uh-uh . It is a mish-mash of all of the above . There were some excellent action sequences ( many incredibly unbelievable ) , especially in the last 20 minutes . Some of the comic interplay between Wesley and Woody was amusing , but far from their chemistry in `` Jump '' . J-Lo 's character served no purpose except to show a little skin . She slowed the pace down for the first hour of the movie , it seemed like watching it in slow motion . It could have been an excellent action-packed buddy film of the Lethal Weapon genre if only the writers offered us a decent script . Instead , we got disconnected plotting and a whole lot of far-fetched antics . And Robert Blake should have `` Virginia Baked '' tattooed on his forehead . And what was up with Cooper 's character ? It seemed like the writers of the script came up with an idea for a serial killer/robber plot , but then could n't figure out what to do with him and wrote him out of the film halfway through without any resolution for his motive or background . Instead , the writers might have just recently spent an evening watching `` The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3 '' and switched tracks , so to speak , and said `` hey , this might be a good idea for that new Harrelson/J-Lo/Snipes film we have to provide a script for tomorrow . '' The writing and direction seems to be spontaneous , and NOT in a good way .	-1
Just got to sit down to watch this ... and it starts in the middle ... not buying old dvd 's again ... this was a rip-off !	-1
This film was on & # 34 ; free & # 34 ; TV tonight , so I decided to watch it . I believe that I saw it once before , right after it first released back in 1998 ; you 'd think that I would have learned my lesson the first time.What . . . a. . . crock . And that crock ai n't full of butter . This has to be one of the most contrived scenarios ever in film . What ? You 've got a cop named Frank -- Andy Garcia -- who has a son Matt -- Joseph Cross -- where that son needs a bone marrow transplant , and the only person in the whole wide world is a psychopathic killer -- Michael Keaton -- who 's a match . Sure . So we know that both the psycho and the son will have surgery , and you know things will go terribly wrong , and you know that Mr. Keaton 's gon na go all Silence-of-the-Lambs ( SOTL ) all over everybody . & # 34 ; Clarice , and what did you think about while watching this film ? How b-a-a-a-a-d it was ? Perhaps you should have slaughtered it yourself and saved everyone the misery. & # 34 ; Har har.Talking about SOTL . . . . Obviously , the writer and director & # 34 ; borrowed & # 34 ; from that far superior film here , what with some of the stupid stuff with the Keaton character being a Hannibal Lecter-like dude . But really , if you 're going to & # 34 ; borrow & # 34 ; something , why do n't you take the best parts while borrowing , not the worst parts ? I was laughing out loud in a couple of scenes where I was supposed to be hiding under a blanket , I think.Well , I think that 1998 was about the same time where Mr. Keaton -- who was in some really funny movies way back when , remember ? Like & # 34 ; Night Shift & # 34 ; and the whole & # 34 ; let 's feed mayonnaise to the tuna fish ! & # 34 ; line ? -- and his career decided to take a swan dive . And this film does a horrible belly flop of its own , right into the tank.If a doctor came to me and said , & # 34 ; You need a bone marrow transplant to save your life , but to get that transplant , you 'll have to watch 'Desperate Measures ' first. & # 34 ; I think I 'd respond , & # 34 ; Get me my lawyer . I need to write my last will and testament . And quick. & # 34 ;	-1
Complete and utter crock of trash . The beginning of the film started off failrly well and I was starting to enjoy it . As if looking down a large and scary slop it all went down hill from that point on . I 'm struggling to find out how someone could rate this movie anything above 2/5 . I will admit that Michael Keaton played his character well , however , the plot of the movie was thin at best . All I can say is that buyer beware . If you like Micheal Keaton - then get it . If , for that matter , you like Andy Garcia as the 'cop who has to save is son ' then get it . Otherwise , steer clear of this movie as I personally did n't find it enjoyable .	-1
Despite the sticker hailing `` all new digital restoration '' this edition is no different from previous offerings- all the edge enhancement is stilll there . Stick with the superbit version	-1
Since Pioneer 's laserdisc version clocked in at 181 minutes , and this DVD is around 166 , you had to know that this release was going to be inferior . And , no surprise , it is . The Entrance , Intermission , and Exit music have all been cut out . The last verse to & quot ; The Lees Of Old Virginia & quot ; is gone . Plus , one of my favorite scenes has been taken out ... When John Adams is waking up at the foot of Thomas Jefferson 's stairs , and Philadelphia is starting it 's day.What a tremendous disappointment this DVD is , after having seen the Pioneer 's laserdisc release . Shame on Sony , and Peter Hunt for not giving us the entire print of this fabulous movie !	-1
I remember 1776 as a kid and I was excited as all get out when I finally gotmy 1776 Restored Director 's Cut ( 1972 ) movie.My Microsoft Media Player would n't play it and Quicktime/Real Player wantmoney to play it . Even my Nero Player would n't play this CD . So I'mstuck with a bad CD that does n't work . It will be awhile before I buy from Amazon unless they contact me and tell me what I need to doto get this movie CD to work . The intro plays but it is stuck on themain menu and wo n't go any further . I have tried everything.What a complete disappointment.1776 ( Restored Director 's Cut )	-1
They tried , honestly tried to give this film the release it deserves . The problem is they managed to mess up the aspect ratio on the initial release . That 's probably why this edition of the DVD has since been discontinued in favor of the extra special 2-disc edition . Amazon # B0007MAO0MOn a normal television the image appears squashed . On a widescreen TV it appears in 4:3 mode and still appears squashed . You have to manually expand it with the aspect setting on either your TV or DVD player . Either way it 's unwatchable . Get the 2 disc version instead .	-1
This movie was just okay . I thought it was a different movie , It was a good whoops though . I would n't recommend this movie	-1
The making of this movie was quite an undertaking . Unfortunately , it never quite makes the grade . The characters are not developed . Instead , they are caricatures of those whom they purport to be.One expedition leader , the late Scott Fischer , comes across as a mellow , disorganized , bumbling dude . One of his expedition guides , the late Anatoli Boukreev , is depicted as a self centered , Neanderthal like he-man , who clearly differs with his boss on what his role as a guide is to be.Another expedition leader , the late Rob Hall , fares somewhat better , in that he is portrayed as an organized , stand up expedition leader , who puts the welfare of his clients above his own . His much publicized radio farewll to his pregnant wife is included as part of the drama.Socialite Sandy Hill Pittman seems to represent conspicuous consumption and is depicted as a self-absorbed , rich bitch with little regard for the Sherpas whom she treats as little more than human yaks . Texan Beck Weathers fares little better , as he is characterized as a buffoon . I am sure that , were he to see this movie , he would wish that they 'd have left him on Everest.The actor who plays Jon Krakauer 's character has the thankless role of Greek chorus . He is there to basically tie up loose ends in the movie . He portrays Krakauer as a dour , humorless human being who , were it not for the fact that he is a talented writer , would have been pushed off the Lhotse face of Everest by some enterprising soul . Last , but certainly not least , are the Sherpas , who are shown as wise , brave , put upon souls . Now here , the movie is hitting its mark.The cinematography is laughable . Numerous shots of a mountain purporting to be Everest are easily spotted as shots of a mountain other than Everest . Since when is Everest without its signature tell tale plume , waving banner like in the sky ? Let me cut to the chase . Read the well written book upon which the movie is based , & quot ; Into Thin Air & quot ; by Jon Krakauer . Do not bother with this movie , unless , like me , you are an Everest junkie and a glutton for punishment . It is the only reason that I rated the movie with two stars instead of just one . Even so , it is still pretty much of a stinker .	-1
Into Thin Air : Death On Everest~1997I 'm afraid to say that this is a very poor movie based on a true story . If you want something along the similiar lines of this read Jon Krakauer 's book or watch Vertical Limit anyway I will tell you the plot : In May 1996 , writer Jon Krakauer joined a party of experienced and amatuer climbers-lead by Everest veterans Scott Fisher and New Zealander Rob Hall-who attempted to reach the world 's highest and most infamous mountain . Krakauer was one of the lucky ones , he made it back alive- 12 people did n't .	-1
If you want to enjoy this movie , you have to totally erase from your mind any thought that the story is based on Victor Hugo 's book.The book 's mighty themes of mercy , forgiveness and spiritual redemption are trampled to death with this depiction of a Valjean whose rage is always under the surface and barely contained . It 's not inconceivable that a man who has been brutally imprisoned for 19 years would emerge a hardened and angry man . But it 's not the portrayal you get in the book , and it erodes the sympathy you have for him in the movie . Strike a priest ? Hit Cossette ? ! ? Not a chance . ( And equally unbelievable that Cossette , minutes later , would stroke his cheek in love . ) It renders silly the scene in which Valjean refuses to kill Inspector Javert . The man in this movie would leap at the chance ! At least you get a good laugh as the scriptwriters try to craft a love story between Valjean and Fantine . She even rallies from her death bed to enjoy an intimate lunch with her benefactor -- rosy cheeks and all ! Ha ! And do n't even get me started on the ending , as Valjean strolls away from Javert 's suicide , light-hearted and smiling . One of the emotional cores of the story , co-opted by a Disney mindset.It 's incredible to think that a West End ( and Broadway ) musical got the story so much better . So , if you rented this movie and are determined to watch it , just forget anything you ever knew about the story and you 'll get through it .	-1
I very much wanted to see this movie when it first came out and so I did , but was very disapointed.After watching the Dream Cast musical on several occasions . You would think they could make something wonderful out of this book but it looked like to me they did n't even try .	-1
This movie is the epitome of excess : budget , explosions , melodrama , & quot ; cuteness & quot ; , in-jokes . LAH is one of those films that thinks its a lot more hip and clever than what it really is . It claims to be a spoof of the action movie genre when all it really does is shake its own hands . The jokes are not funny and yet you get the feeling that the people responsible for this cinematic atrocity are sending a subliminal message that translates as , & quot ; That skit was pretty cool , huh ? & quot ; . The action sequences , intended to be absurd , only elicit yawning . The child , who was intended to be cute , is annoying.The only saving grace , if you can call it that , LAH has is Arnold Schwarzeneggar 's performance . His ( non ) acting is just as good in this movie as it is in THE TERMINATOR or TRUE LIES . If the only good thing about your movie is Schwarzeneggar 's acting , then your movie is in serious trouble.I like a good spoof movie as much as anyone , as long as it is funny like BLAZING SADDLES or THE NAKED GUN movies . But I think this movie was best described on an episode of THE SIMPSONS . On that episode there was a fancy party in which all the beautiful people of Springfield attended . There was a character at the party inspired by Arnold Schwarzeneggar named Rainier Wolfcastle . Police Chief Wiggum walked up the Wolfcastle and said , & quot ; Magic ticket , my a** ! & quot ; . My sentiments exactly .	-1
Truculent , unispired directed movie . The original idea was good , but was wasted while developing it . THi child is annoying , not a good actor at all .	-1
One has to wonder about the reasoning behind removing so much of this wonderful special 's original material from this DVD release . I have my original copy that I taped off of television way back in the mid 80 's , and I 'd rather watch THAT , fuzzy degrading , annoying Osh Kosh commercials , and all ... at least it 's INTACT . Not only have several songs been removed , but the final pay-off to a VERY long running gag ( the icy patch ) ended up on the cutting room floor , as well , being that it was at the very end of Piggy 's song ( & quot ; Home for the Holidays & quot ; , cut out ) . The editing is SO bad , you can actually TELL where things were removed . Such a shame . Here 's hoping the matter can be settled , and a fully-restored version offered ... though I would n't hold my breath . After all , there are MANY more Muppet television specials that have disappeared into the mists of time , as well .	-1
This is specifically about the Blu-Ray Unrated Edition of this movie . There are no extras on this Blu-Ray . None . Not even a commentary track . The DVD theatrical release does n't have much either , but at least it has a commentary . I bought this without reading the back of it closely enough , figuring it would have everything the old DVD I have did , but I was wrong ! So now I have to hang onto the DVD for the commentary , and for the pieces of the story that were REMOVED from this unrated edition ! A note to movie studios : Stop putting out Blu-Rays with no extras ! You have 25-50GB to work with . There is no excuse !	-1
A tale of hubris , betrayal , illicit sex , and murder , `` Wild Things '' stacks one surprise and cheap thrill on top of another until the whole thing comes tumbling down like a topheavy house . Lacking the fundamental assets of originality or an intelligent , coherent script , the film instead tries to dazzle the viewer with an endless string of nearly-impossible plot twists that finally unravels completely . Never meant to be taken completely seriously , `` Wild Things '' often crosses over into outright camp . The characters are unbelievable and unsympathetic , and the plot is beyond incredulity . Do n't blame the cast though ; Matt Dillon , Neve Campbell , Denise Richards , Kevin Bacon , and Bill Murray do what they can with the illiterate script and almost save the day with their collectively strong performance . But movies are a collaborative effort , and good acting alone ca n't make up for negligible direction and writing . The only other noteworthy facet of this movie is the slinky and haunting soundtrack . Sadly , that 's just not enough . Though not without its moments , `` Wild Things '' is too disjointed to recommend .	-1
I guess whenever there 's a movie on the war in Bosnia , there will be accusations of propaganda , skewing facts , rewriting history , biases , and so forth . As an aside , I do have to say that Savior comes out on the Serbian side , with Muslims being the definite bad guys here . ( If you 're looking for a relatively middle of the road view , see No Man 's Land . ) But that is none of my concern here.I understand the movie was made on a budget ( as seems clear from the director 's commentary ) , but that is no excuse for its many shortcomings.First , the good stuff.It looks great . Great location , nice colours , and it sounds good to boot . Good production.The action/fight scenes are very well done , not overdone in the ever so popular action movie style , but they do n't look cheap and cheesy , just natural and realistic . Violence is well measured , purposeful ( within the movie and plot ) and has realistic results and consequences.Camera work is good too , the close ups from Quaid 's PoV work especially well . It 's almost like being there : ) Finally , before I forget , the meat of the plot and Quaid 's character are quite good.But could have been worked better.The opening scenes ( developed as almost a separate sub-movie ) introduce us to Quaid 's character . Then he 's off to Foreign Legion boot camp , and does a couple of missions , which presumably make him a hardened veteran . Really , they 're just confusing . Too short to matter and to absorb . Suddenly we 're in Bosnia looking through a sniper 's scope . Aside from the opening scenes , we 're left to assume Quaid 's a tortured , restless , numb soul . He must be , because the director says so . Listening to the director 's commentary track , you have to laugh out loud at times , because what he 's describing and what you 're seeing are almost total opposites . And I do n't think it 's a language barrier.The director also keeps blaming the 'financiers ' for many things . They wanted this , and that , did n't like this , etc , etc . Please ... The dialogue is very stiff , very forced and unnatural . Good thing the kid gets off-screen early ; he 's your typical Hollywood portrayal of a child , asking all these insightful adult questions , like 'is god in bad people too ? ' Adults do n't fare much better , delivering disjoint , wooden lines every couple of minutes . And what 's with those voices ? Sure is a lot of grunting going around . Goran is just about the only guy with any soul showing in the movie.That 's my biggest beef here . It 's almost painful to sit through the thing sometimes , you just got ta cringe and bear it for a few more minutes.Which brings me to the last point . I do n't see this as a difficult movie , or tough , or rough , or challanging , or any of that . Some reviewer said that the slight glimmer of hope with the baby was the only thing that made it worthwhile . Personally , I thought the movie took the easy way out several times , the major one being the baby plot . Just a little too wishy-washy Hollywoody happy ending style . There are a couple of scenes that will make your average American movie goer wince and oooh , and aww ( out of social responsibility mostly ) , but nothing a seasoned war movie veteran has n't seen before in more brutal detail.Really , if the director intended for us to see Quaid 's stuggle with himself , his humanity , his search for hope , it should have been more subtle , using plot points like the baby as mere devices , means to an end , not bludgeon viewers over the head to make sure they do n't miss the obvious . And the director clearly indicates , time and time again , that this is a character study . Well , if it is , how come there 's so little character ? 2/5 . It 's not a bad movie , it just has a few bad points that really spoil a good idea , and a great opportunity for a classic and powerful film .	-1
I really do n't know what these guys were thinking . Maybe their thought process went a little like this : Exec # 1 : I have a great ( read : stupid ) idea ! Exec # 2 : What is it ? Exec # 1 : Remember those old Godzillla movies ? Exec # 2 : The ones that were really cool and did n't feature Matthew Broderick ? Exec # 1 : Yeah ! Let 's make a movie that 's the complete opposite of that ! So that 's how we got H-bomb-proof lizards turning into asexual she-beasts rampaging about in Manhattan . There are documentaries about cardboard factories more interesting than this . And if that does n't put the terror of this movie 's idiocy in perspective , think about this : I 've seen Ernest Goes To Camp SIX TIMES , and I still refuse to watch this trash again .	-1
This is the only film I have ever felt totally ashamed to have contributed to their theater take . Honestly , folks , this is one stinker of a movie whose excellent DVD features can not ever fully atone for.We all grew up watching the badly-dubbed Godzilla films from Japan , and many of us actually liked the campy , poorly translated flicks with a guy in a rubber suit stomping on model tanks and buildings ( and then later protecting the Earth from all manner of evil mega-monsters ) . Unfortunately , this film is everything that the Japanese films are not.Produced in the middle of a series of intentionally-made `` blockbuster '' movies ( following such fine fare as Independence Day and anticpating the awful Armageddon and Wild Wild West ) , this movie intentionally tries to go in too many directions to succeed -- is it a campy monster movie of the 60 's presenting ecological warnings , or perhaps an action/science thriller a la Jurassic Park , or even a special effects extravaganza ? Godzilla never seems to make up its mind.The action sequences fail to thrill as they come across as contrived and artificial , many looking to be made for prompt conversion to video games . The acting , too , leaves much to be desired ; Godzilla will stand always as a blemish on Matthew Broderick 's career . The movie goes on about an hour longer than it should , forcing audiences to endure the death of Godzilla only to face her ( ! ) babies , CG near-clones of velociraptors from Jurassic Park that chase our heroes around Madison Square Garden.Godzilla has the distinction of being one of less than a handful of films I 've shouted at in the theater -- here , when said title monster chases a helicopter through downtown NYC , I literally shouted , `` GO UP ! '' ... but apparently helicopters can only fly horizontally and get run down by a hungry monster.I would like to recommend this film for a `` bad movie night '' or for inclusion on any future episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 , but then I 'd be indirectly contributing to the film 's financial gains . Watch this for a laugh or a groan if someone else has it on hand , but do n't waste your own money .	-1
A series of nuclear weapons are tested in the South Pacific during the 1950 's , and the film Godzilla moves swiftly and uninterestingly into the present as a shocked Japanese man ( the only sign of Japanese involvement in this Americanized adaptation ) in a hospital deliriously repeats & quot ; Gojira , Gojira , Gojira & quot ; .As was the premise for the original film , nuke testing has spawned a huge Gojira ( Japanese for Sea Dragon ) . The name is later adapted in the film as it was in the filmgoing market , to Godzilla , a mere mispronunciation.Doctor Nick Tatopolous ( Matthew Broderick ) has been employed by the US military in order to help catch the ship-sinking , fire-breathing creature with the piercing roar and not so good looks . The lack of continuity is never more obvious than when Dr. Tatopolous explains the creature with great aptitude , even before it stomps into his life . From here , the film takes a by-the-numbers approach in that the last three-quarters of it yields nothing but explosions , fire and lots of stupid one-liners.And who could resist babies ! Discovered inside a now demolished Madison Square Garden , the nest with Godzilla 's 200 eggs is a mere walk down memory lane to James Cameron 's Aliens . Could there possibly be anything original to look forward to after that ? Do n't hold your fiery breath . Slews of rip-offs ranging from Jurassic Park to King Kong fill the rest of this hype-vehicle of no-brain folly . Godzilla is at best , remotely entertaining during the its 15 minutes . After which this mammoth publicity stunt loses steam at record rates . You would think that after creating such turkeys as ID4 and Stargate , the team of director Roland Emmerich and producer Dean Devlin ( the awesome twosome ? ) would have had enough sense to try to put out something commendable this time around . But like in many things , there is simply no cure . Not since Starship Troopers have I seen such bad visual effects , gratuitous violence and paper-thin story lines . The characters in this film are so cardboard , they belong in a police shooting range . Take a classic film and put it in the hands of profiteers rather than filmmakers , and I give you the official mascot for the worst movie since Waterworld .	-1
This is the worst . When I went to see this I was eagerly anticipating what Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich could do with the King of the Monsters , and afterwards I was so dissapointed I was in shock . The plot and acting were so checkered and badly formed that they could n't come close to standing on their own , so only the lizard creature could hope to save the movie . Unfortunatley this creature is so weak that it ca n't even save itself from a few fighter jets . As the movie rolled to it 's unsatisfying , pointless conclusion with an obvious hint at a sequel , I found myself constanlty checking my watch thinking & quot ; when will this movie end ? & quot ; I just want to put this abomination behind me and wait for Godzilla 2000 .	-1
This film is probably the best example of where movies are heading nowadays : big special effects , little or no plot . The acting was terrible , as was the script . It was meant to be funny and clever , I suppose , and it achieves the funny part , though it falls short of clever.As for the special effects , yeah , they were good , but they completely butchered Godzilla . So the Godzilla in the original movie was a guy in a suit , but I can just imagine what the directors of that one could have done with some CGI ! In the new version , Godilla is just an overgrown T-Rex . How does an iguana go from being a lizard to a bipedal , bird hipped dinosaur anyway , even through extreme mutation ? It 's just cheesy . Also , the baby zilla remind me WAY too much of velociraptors.Even if this film was meant to be a parody , as some have argued , it should n't have been . They should have let some TALENTED directors recreate this story for all it 's glory .	-1
A misguided Hollywood desecration of everyone 's favorite city stomper . Bearing no relation to the 1954 original , `` Godzilla '' ( 1998 ) gives escapism a bad name . Poor Matthew Broderick earns his top billing in an overlong snoozefest . What happened to the $ 130 million budget ? It 's certainly not on the screen .	-1
& quot ; Godzilla & quot ; is just like the creature after which it 's named : big , loud , and without direction . The plot only serves as an excuse for the movie , and the special effects are PlayStation silly . Matthew Broderick looks blank and does little to spice things up , and the dialogue is choppy . Oh , the soundtrack has a single from P. Diddy , who annoys me to no end . I ca n't say & quot ; Godzilla & quot ; is a complete disaster , but for an effects-heavy summer popcorn flick , you can do way better than this .	-1
No , this overblown epic from Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin ( the masterminds who made `` Universal Soldier '' ) have come up with the most disappointing monster movie of all time . Go-chila was never seen and when he finally appeared on screen , everybody watching this trash had fallen asleep . Matthew Broderick plays a scientist who discovers the new breed which is a cross between an alligator , a lizard and Andre the Giant . An ugly piece of cinema . Helicopters and jets ca n't stop the thing because they just blow up monumental buildings in New York instead . No aim ! The creature chases the scientist and his friends and it 's not funny . Little Godzilla babies run around making a mess of consession stands in Madison Square Garden . Bad mother for not teaching your children manners . Bad director for making a slow boring movie that is just another `` The Lost World : Jurassic Park '' done worse . Japanese people should be ashamed of this movie that does n't contain people running around waving their arms like maniacs screaming , `` Godzilla ! '' But , I was doing that running out of the theaters with popcorn spewing out of my mouth .	-1
You know , I have been watching godzilla films since the 60 's , although the film is good..they forgot the name of the show , godzilla ... not people run though new york..we olny see godzilla breifly.and only half of him..well I guess thats show bissnesses	-1
Looking over Maria Pitillo 's career , she has done rather well as an actress . But as soon as GODZILLA , the bomb of 1998 , arrived , her career took a nosedive . Perhaps it was because she won a Razzie Award for worst supporting actress . Or maybe it was because her critics were unkind . It is true that Ms. Pitillo 's sub-par performance was just one distraction in this monumental piece of celluloid crap . But I am not going out of my way to compliment Matthew Broderick 's acting . Nor was Jean Reno helpful . And thank goodness for The Simpsons or else Hank Azaria might be out of work . None of these performers impressed me . And yet only Ms. Pitillo has been directly affected by Roland Emmerich 's GODZILLA , easily the worst movie of 1998 . Ms. Pitillo should not be blamed for her performance in a movie filled with poor acting . The writing was bad . The direction was bad . Even Godzilla ( herself ? ? ? ) seemed embarrassed by this fiasco . How can you blame one actor when you should be pointing the finger at the whole production ? As for Maria Pitillo , I expect she will one day bounce back from this unruly treatment some day soon , and win an award for her many acting skills , and it wo n't be another Razzie .	-1
when i went to see this hyped film in 1998 i was sooo disappointed . i mean i do admire Roland Emmerich and Dean Devilin for StarGate and ID4 , but some people says this makes Ishtar and Howard the Duck look like Winners and i myself did loved & quot ; Howard The Duck & quot ; but this Movie & quot ; Godzilla & quot ; i really did n't like . save your Money on the ID4 DVD instead .	-1
There 's some nuclear tests by the French taking place in the Pacific Ocean , while some iguanas are watching nearby . Flash forward to the present day , a Japanese ship is attacked by something , with one guy surviving and when asked by people what happened he simply said `` Gojira '' , which translated to Godzilla . An NRC scientist named Nick ( Matthew Broderick , `` Glory '' ) studies this and arrives at the conclusion that a giant , radioactive grown lizard is the cause ( which is a reasonable conclusion to make , in fact the first one I 'd make ) and that this lizard could come and attack the U.S.Godzilla does arrive in New York , causing a massive wave of destruction yet somehow a cameraman named Victor ( Hank Azaria , `` The Simpsons '' ) is spared despite being right in the path of his foot . From here on its about the military trying to stop Godzilla who continues to cause damage wherever he goes.I certainly would n't expect a movie with Godzilla to be a well written or decently acted flick , but the dialogue , story and acting is just bad and I mean bad . The action sequences even the initial attack on Manhattan are fairly mundane and not very exciting , the explanation for Godzilla 's visit is just laughable and the end sadly left open the chance for a sequel.It was sad to see actors like Jean Reno ( `` The Professional '' ) used in this tripe , he is funny but it seems forced to as he 's much better than this . The director Roland Emmerich ( `` Independence Day '' , `` The Patriot '' ) really just seems to phone it in on a lot of this and the effort put into the destruction in the action scenes while good initially just seems hollow after a bit . * out of 4 stars .	-1
Not godzilla at all.Godzilla was very big and did n't hide in sewers.He knocked buildings down , didnt run around them.He was smart , not just a big iguana.This was more like an escapee from jurassic park.I liked Jean Reno , hated Mathew broderick .I really disliked this film first time i saw it but later revisited it ( this yr ) and didnt find it quite so objectionable but still should n't have been called godzilla .	-1
I can remember as a kid , always loving Godzilla.I loved watching the old 1950 & 1960 's Japanese films.This one however , is a far cry from any of the classics , and sets itself up in history as one of the `` Big Block Buster Boobs '' of the summer.Kids will love the movie for the moster , because it does look impressive on screen , and the special effrects are fantastic.The story is ok , but infentile at best.It was very predictacble , but I think the story itself was engineered that way.All in all , I would'nt pay a red cent to own it , it really is'nt worth it .	-1
In 1998 , long time Godzilla fans feared the worst when Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich unleashed their monster `` epic '' , but one thing was missing ... .GODZILLA ! Where is Godzilla in this movie ? I sure do n't see him , do you ? I thought this was going to be a Godzilla film , not another Jurassic Park sequel . Oh , do n't get me wrong ... Tristar and Devlin/Emmerich are n't the only ones to blame for this truly AWFUL film , but the owners of Godzilla in Japan , Toho ! They were the ones who approved the terrible new design of Godzilla , and ultimately had to make up for it by bringing back the TRUE and REAL Godzilla in Japan only a year later . As for this film ( if you can even call it that ) , avoid it and just be glad that it FAILED and Devlin/Emmerich will never again lay a finger on the true king of the monsters - GODZILLA ! ( a few short years later , the Devlin/Emmerich team broke up , and the planned sequel never happened . Let 's all rejoice ! I hope Devlin and Emmerich are proud of themselves ... )	-1
This is one of the worst movies I 've seen ever . This is a story about a man , nammed Billy Hayes ( Brad Davis ) who tries to smuggle hessise ( turkish drug ) across the boader to America . But there is one small problem he gets caught . He is sentecenced to serve four years in a turkish prison . Billy leaves a worried girlfriend , father , mother , brother , and sister behind . In the prison he meets durgies and a whole new kind of people he never thought would exsist . The guards beat and tourcher not only him but everybody in that prison and other prisons in that part of the world were just the same . In Turkey who do n't have the right to free speech like in America so when he went to court he had a hard time trying to defend himself . Billy is then sentenced to 30 years in the prison which I might add does not really qualify as a prison at all in my opinon . Billy and Rand quaid and one other person try to escape for every day for a whole week but then they are caught by a inmatte who gives randy qaid away . Randy is beaten so bad that he is in a hospital for months with a hernia . Billy gets so mad he kills ruski the immate who gives them away and basically goes insane witth rage and then immeditly after he is sent to a turkish mental institution with pyscos . His girlfriend talks to him and he has a new light os getting out . He bribes then kills a guard puts on his uniform and leaves . Three months later he crosses the boarder into Greece and gets on a plane and goes back to America to reunite with his family.This is emmotional true story . I dont like this movie for many reasons one is almost have the movie is spoken in the turkish natoinal language . This has too many graphic seens that I do n't care for and many people wo n't like . I was frequntly looking at how much time was left in the movie and you should never be doing that when your wacthing a movie . I do n't like this for another reason becausethe story is horribal even though it is true . I just do n't like to see Americans being beaten in a turkish prison . Maybe you would like to rent this movie and see what I 'm talking about but this is definitly not a movie to buy .	-1
at no time does this movie ever reach the point of being beliveable and even for an action movie at some point it has to do that ! the helicopter is very cool , but do they really think that if it was going to be used to keep everyday people in line they would test it out in the open like this much less let a pilot that is known as aloose cannon be the one to test it ? the other problem is that they go out of their way to keep the movie lite and then add a very sick murder in for spice i guess . skip it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
It seems that the Region 1 DVD release of `` Blue Thunder '' which has been available for some time includes only a `` pan & scan '' movie presentation . For those waiting for a Region 1 `` widescreen '' movie presentation , a `` Widescreen Special Edition '' release has been announced for April 4 , 2006 .	-1
BLUE THUNDER ( 1983 ) Directed by John Badham . Written by Dan O'Bannon.Starring Roy Scheider , Warren Oates , Candy Clark , Daniel Stern , Anthony James , Joe Santos , James Murtaugh , Jack Murdock and Malcolm McDowelll.A helicopter pilot for the Los Angeles police tortured by his time among the drunken hopheaded racist nazi baby killing rapists in Vietnam is chosen to test a new futuristic super helicopter called Blue Thunder that is intended for use against any terrorists or civil uprisings.This somehow being a bad thing , those behind the helicopter -- -Vietnam Veterans , the police and representatives of the Reagan administration ( Christians and Jews being busy that week ) apparently feel the need to justify the weapon 's existence by sending agents into the Watts area to create disturbances -- - as we all know Watts is otherwise a bastion of peace and law abiding citizenry and all the crime there is committed by Whites in blackface -- -and murder anyone who opposes the new weapon -- though why just any clear headed patriotic American WOULD oppose the Blue Thunder is not clear..The pilot discovers this vast right wing conspiracy , steals the helicopter and attempts to get the truth out . The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy attempts to stop him destroying much of downtown Los Angeles in the process.While the technical aspects of the film -- -especially the flying scenes and the BlueThunder itself are generally cool and well done and the acting is about as good as it can be , the film is grounded by the basic foolishness of its premises which eventually leaves the film just sitting on the tarmac as the passengers wait impatiently to get off.The idea that it is a bad thing to have a super helicopter for use against terrorists and rioters was stupid then and , after the Rodney Riots , the Crown Heights pogrom and 9/11 , is exactly what one would think it is now . Obviously it would be VERY BAD that the Blue Thunder existed ... ... ... ..for terrorists , rioters ... ..and their allies and supporters . For everyone else , the Blue Thunder would be a great and wonderful thing.The film has the usual commie prop smears . The main villain Macolm MacDowall is the inexplicably English -- and so vaguely homosexual -- - Nordic looking Vietnam Vet who used to enjoy tossing noble Communist officers from his helicopter in Vietnam though he somehow manages not to take drugs , drink nor does he rape anyone but that is about it . Schreider is given Candy Clark to show that he is a good virile heterosexual like all good liberals are . Certainly Clarke -- the only female in the cast save briefly a Black Woman who is nearly raped by the agents of the Right Wing Wing Conspiracy -- serves no other purpose and , in fact , one is still unsure whether she is supposed to be Scheider 's wife or girlfriend . Scheider is also shown having a Hispanic friend . His token Black friend being out of town that week.The film makes a big whoha over how the Blue Thunder is somehow this great big threat to civil liberties and Democracy and yet takes great glee in violating those same civil liberties of McDowall and crew upon the apparent theory that Communist , liberals and minorities have Civil Right but people they do not like do not.The script -- -flawed in many ways from lack of plot resolutions to underdelveloped characters -- - makes the major and tension deflating mistake of having Scheider steal the Blue Thunder and having the villains try and stop him with inferior weaponry . The thing is practically a flying tank and yet the big dog fight at the end is between Scheider in his unstoppable flying fortress and McDowell in this little helicopter put put.What ANY OTHER normal filmaker would have done would to have dropped the whole silly ass vast ring wing conspiracy plot and have the helicopter stolen by either a Moslem Terrorist or a Communist agent who plan to do something bad with it and then send Scheider up in the little helicopter put put to try and stop it . That is called suspense . That is called putting the hero up against tremendous odds.But no . We had to have our Commie Prop . Reagan was in office and there were things more important than such luxuries like artistic integrity or even competent film making.This was Warren Oates last film . He died soon afterwards . Pity this was his last film.Blue Thunder is merely just a little gas.Take an alka seltzer.One wonders if the Blue Thunder is still futuristic or has the present caught up to the Sci Fic elements ? ? If so , one DOES hope though that the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy rebuilt the Blue Thunder and sent it to Iraq , Afghanistan and the Philipines to aid a good number of Moslem Barbarians to attain their Islamic paradise .	-1
This is one of the most average horror movies I 've ever seen . The 1990s was a miserable time for the horror genre . The fact that some consider Candyman to be an underrated classic highlights my point . I do like the idea of a researcher looking into an urban legend but the movie is just not well done . The characters are awful and the movie is simple not scary in any way .	-1
If the title of our review was n't a dead giveaway , this movie was incredibly boring . Candyman was released in 1992 and was dubbed by many as a top-notch horror flick . The 1990 's was the golden age of horror , at least in Sid 's slightly unorthadox view . This is a perfect example of what 's wrong with the film industry . This certified snoozer gets the nod as a worthwhile flick while true 90 's classics likeWicked GamesandDeath Ring ( aka The Greatest Movie of All-Time ) go overlooked . But we decided to go with this one based on the fact that it got so much hype when it came out.Basically , the Candyman can be summoned by reciting his name 5 times in the mirror . And once the juice is loose , he will only harm you if you do n't believe in his meat hooking powers . So it lends itself to logic that if you believe in the Candyman , you know what saying his name 5 times will bring ; Sid 's guess is that you just take a pass on chanting `` Candyman '' and keep living a normal life . But not our main character . Nope , she risks her life and those around her to write an awesome thesis on urban legends . Why could n't this girl just do some research to write her thesis ? That 's the one question that can unravel this ridiculous plot.Sid could not find one good thing about this movie . It was plodding , boring , shallow and pedantic . It definitely IS NOT a flick that we would have enjoyed in the good old days . It even gets this lowly distiction : when we turned this piece off from on demand we yelled `` He 's gone ! The evil 's gone from here ! ''	-1
Stay away from this one unless you like digital noise . I am also tired of Criterion skimping on bitrate all the time . Sure , if there are some extras that absolutely need to be there but going below an average bitrate of 25Mbps is surely not needed . What and the hell separates this from so many other transfers just in that range ? On the other hand the digital noise makes this a terrible release.Do n't waste your money unless you NEED to see this in hi-def and like to collect films . I ca n't support it because Criterion knows better . With the misframing of Blue , more than a couple very mediocre transfers , and a whole bunch of middling 20Mbps-24Mbps transfers you really should pick what you buy from them carefully these days.Most of what they do is fantastic stuff . Even some of the lower bitrate releases look great . But when the master used is in bad shape or not for hi-def you ca n't ask for 20 dollars for it much less 40 .	-1
and not really Anthony 's , either . I borrowed the VHS from a friend anticipating a lovely , two-hour or so film with rich , well-developed characters , beautiful scenery , and a riveting storyline . I guess one out of three 's not bad.Howards End promises a lot but underdelivers . With Emma Thompson , Sir Anthony Hopkins , and Helena Bonham-Carter in the lead roles , one expects a more interesting film or at the very least , an exciting climax . One gets neither . This film plods along for over two hours , much like an overworked carthorse stumbling through the English countryside . By the end , all one wants is some oats and a night 's sleep in the barn . What disappointed me most was Bonham-Carter 's performance . She is much better at edgy hysteria than what she shows here.Even the climax was dull . ( In case you still want to see this film , I wo n't give it away . ) In this reviewer 's opinion , if you want a good Merchant Ivory flick , watch A Room with a View instead .	-1
Despite what Criterion may say , there is a fault with this disc . They have said you need to calibrate your set , or that you should n't watch the disc on vivid and sharp mode . But lowering these settings is not enough to get rid of all the digital noise on this disc , and it 's the only blu-ray I 've ever come across that looks this bad . I encourage you to rent the disc before you buy it , so you can see for yourself.I hate giving one star to a movie this good . But the Blu-ray is not even worthy of that one star .	-1
I am really glad that this is an anomaly , instead of the usual fare that we come to expect from JCVD . Some peeping Tom like behavior and a really uncomfortable scene in the river , plus a crappy ending . Then the rest was boring . I rented this , and will only be watching it once . I do n't expect non-stop action , but this could have been better .	-1
The Quick and the Dead , 1995 filmThis story is set in a tiny town in a desert . A bandit gang has taken over , and oppresses the people with high taxes and low wages . [ Any similarity to your city , state , or country is purely coincidental . ] This ruler is famous for his prowess with a quick draw of a pistol . [ The quick draw fantasy was concocted by Eastern writers of fiction , although there may have been a few examples in the real west . ] The ruler arranges gladiator contests using pistols to awe and amuse the townspeople ( no other sporting events ) . Each gladiator has a personal history that is given as part of the story . There are personal conflicts as well , however fantastic they seem . Do not expect to learn anything , its just entertainment.Of course there has to be some sort of moral , and ending where the good guys win over the villains . You 'll see examples taken from horror films where the monster pops up after being killed and assumed dead . This works better in films with an unearthly creature . The styles of dress say the late 19th century . The isolation of this town ( no railroads or stagecoaches ) suggests an Arizona desert . There is no mention of mining or other production to explain this isolated town . Does this story have any redeeming social value ? Not even as a costume drama . If you watch it closely you can estimate which scenes use doubles and the editing to hide this . There are better films that you can watch for entertainment and education .	-1
There are a lot of things wrong with this western . It has a great premise with lots of promise ; a great cast that could and should deliver strong performances and yet it comes across overly campy and boring and ultimately forgettable . I was initially excited to see this film since I adore everything Russell Crowe ( how many times have I uttered those words this past week ) but when I saw this film a few years back I cringed at the thought that he starred in this drivel . I shrugged it off as a minor misstep in an impressive career and moved on . A few weeks back though my wife happened to rent this thinking I 'd be excited to watch it . Having just watched the Crowe masterpiece ` 3:10 to Yuma ' and salivating over every frame I decided that maybe I 'd enjoy this movie now . Well , my opinion has n't changed. ` The Quick and the Dead ' drops us in the dusty town of Redemption ( such a clich & eacute ; western name ) and introduces us to its rowdy inhabitance . The town is ruled with an iron fist by tyrant John Herod who seems to thrive on the spilled blood of others . He has butted heads with reformed Cort , a man of God who has left his criminal ways of the past behind him . Herod refuses to let him forget the man he once was and tries to pressure him into signing up for his ` Quick Draw ' contest . Cort refuses and thus makes himself Herod 's prisoner . Then in walks Ellen , a young woman apparently scorned who has a vendetta against the evil Herod . She enters his contest in order to have her revenge by taking his life.Like I said , the premise has promise , but it all falls terribly flat . The biggest problem I have is the atrocity that is Sharon Stone . I 'll never understand this woman 's draw on the public . Her acting chops is the farthest thing from decent ; in fact she 's so horrid that the mere fact I ` LOVE ' her performance in ` Casino ' almost repulses me . She does n't understand Ellen in the slightest and plays her so sullen and so dull that I wish they had cast someone slightly talented for the role . The only good thing I can say about Stone is that she hand picked Crowe for his role here ; so at least she notices real talent despite her lack of it . DiCaprio is another drawback . I love what this kid became but this performance is too hammy for me to appreciate . Russell Crowe and Gene Hackman are the only redeeming factors to this film when it comes to acting . Crowe 's performance , while not his finest , is strong and polished and Hackman is always top-notch when playing the villain . Sadly , they alone ca n't save this mess.I like the point I heard one reviewer make in regards to this film ; that it 's a Sam Raimi film and so it must be a cartoon . He then proceeded to make that a good thing but I ca n't do that . It is a cartoon but I do n't think that was purposeful and that what makes it so horrific . When Stone tries to act hard , hurt or suffering she looks tired , bored and confused . Raimi tries to make something dramatic and meaningful and fails miserably . The ending was so corny and contrived that I could n't stop rolling my eyes , even after they started aching and begging for mercy . In the end I went with two stars over the more appropriate on for the fact that both Crowe and Hackman at least deserve a star a piece for trying desperately to salvage this burning heap of trash .	-1
I do not own this movie on bluray or DVD but I do have it on VHS . The only reason I have this movie at all is I got involved in a video club many years ago and it was free . This movie has only one plot , turn gunfighting into a sport . That 's it ! A couple of hours ( not sure how long the film is since I 've only wathed it once ) of two people standing in the street shooting at each other . The one that looses is dragged off and another one steps up . Terrible ! Those that know history know that gunfights in the old west was not as prevailent as in the movies for a couple of reasons . First , you could die , second , guns were not very acurate , third , ammo was expensive . I love westerns for the stories they tell about life back then but this dog has none of that . I 've tried to give this movie away several times and thought I was sucessful a couple of times but it always came back mysteriously . If you love westerns , stay way from this one ! ! ! The only reason I gave this movie one star is because I could n't give it the negative 5 stars it deserves ! !	-1
Anyone ANYONE who liked this movie has zero appreciation for a good western.this is one of the worst movies ever ! western or any genre ! ! ! !	-1
The Bottom Line : With its exploding grass shacks , evil ethnic enemy types , Central American locations and uninspired acting , Sniper often plays more like a boring parody of action movies than a legitimate entry in the genre ; unless you 're a die-hard fan of Tom Berenger or Billy Zane ( do those exist ? ) I would advise you to stay far away from this unappealing film.2/4	-1
I do n't know if this movie is dated or was never funny in the first place . I wish I saw it in 1981 so I could better assess this . Bill Murray basically plays Saturday Night Live 's Bill Murray , a one-dimensional wise-ass character who 's supposed to be cool but is more irritating than anything else . The ending is reminiscent of Animal House : tanks and mayhem substituting for humor .	-1
While the original DVD extended edition gave you the option of seeing the original classic movie the blu ray does not . The additional footage adds absolutily nothing to the movie and changes it from a wonderful comedy to a movie that becomes bogged down in scenes that should have remained on the cutting room floor . SONY/Columbia Pictures should be ashamed for not releasing the original classic movie first on blu ray or at least having the original as a part of the extended blu ray disk . While I give the original moive five out of five stars this extended edition in my opinion barely holds on to two out of five stars .	-1
This new edition of TO DIE FOR is n't what you think..Sony and Image are not telling the truth about the aspect ratio . It is NOT 1.85:1 . It is , in fact , the 1.33:1 version . They used the wrong side of the previous 2-sided disc . Do n't believe the info written about the aspect ratio of the current edition .	-1
I saw this movie when I was like 11 . It was cool then because it was mindless action but , it do n't have the same affect on me now . It 's super corny	-1
Aside from anything else that is good or bad , routine or entertaining about this film , I ca n't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that , in the big murder scene , both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made .	-1
This is one of several Brian De Palma films that pay tribute to the Master of Suspense , director Alfred Hitchcock . While De Palma has never come close to equaling his hero , he has done some great imitations of him in movies like `` Dressed to Kill '' and `` Blowout '' . `` Body Double '' , however , is a weak effort by any standard . It has been branded a blatant rip-off of `` Vertigo '' , but I do n't think it 's even that.In the convoluted plot , an actor needs a temporary place to stay , and an acquaintance puts him up in a spectacular Hollywood Hills home . The friend points out that , through a telescope in the house , one can spy on a woman in a house across the way . Said woman puts on quite a striptease show every evening . One night , the actor sees the woman being robbed by a very spooky character . Already obsessed with her , he begins to follow her around town to make sure she is okay . His spy games lead to danger , murder and some rather graphic encounters in the world of porn video making.This is one of those movies that hinge on a totally improbable plot device . Though he uses a whole bag of cinematic tricks which make some of the movie rather interesting to look at , De Palma never manages to fool the audience into going with the flow of the ludicrous story . The movie can be looked at as a spoof of suspense thriller ; however , it does n't succeed very well on that level either.De Palma had directed some fine movies in his time . `` Body Double '' is definitely a low point , in my opinion . Besides the films mentioned above , the good ones include three crime sagas - `` The Untouchables '' , `` Scarface '' , and `` Carlito 's Way '' , as well as the horror classic , `` Carrie '' .	-1
A limp production not large enough for Streisand 's ego . This vehicle is so self-absorbing , you 'd better have the barf bag ready as soon as you hit play on your VCR . The plot is so unrealistic , only the & quot ; sensitive & quot ; Barbra could have endeavored to make this film.Alright , already Barbra ! You 're the greatest and only good-natured person on the earth !	-1
I thought this movie would be awesome because I knew all those scary stories , and loved them . Unfortunately , Urban Legend 's writer does n't know the meaning of the word & quot ; originality. & quot ; This movie copied off of Scream . At the frat party , the character , Parker , gets a call from the killer on the phone . Of course , the killer is using a voice changer , just like in Scream . Did the writer actually think people would find that scary or original ? I think he was too wrapped up in being on the horror bandwagon that he failed to come up with something original .	-1
I really enjoy Sci-Fi films and the whole cyberpunk genre , but this movie just did n't do it for me . The trailers for this film looked compelling , so I rented it on VHS , but after about 20 minutes I was out like a light . I found this film so dry that it put me to sleep . Look for your Sci-Fi elsewhere kiddies , this one is more potent than Niquil .	-1
You really need to buy the Blu-Ray version of this film.What you get here with this old dvd is a cut-down-zomed-in version.Get the blu-Ray and you 'll get to see the actual whole Movie Film . : D	-1
Boy , after the great & quot ; question reality & quot ; movies like Dark City and The Matrix came out , the bar was raised a little higher for this genre . Unfortunately The Thirteenth Floor falls way short of ever reaching the bar , let alone going over it . The concept of virtual worlds , within virtual worlds did n't quite work in this version because you never find out why they exist . In The Matrix we at least find out that the virtual world therein was created to make humans sedate as they were used as organic power supplies by the AI . The Thirteenth Floor is a pretty hum-drum affair . Every time they used the word & quot ; user & quot ; I kept thinking of the classic Tron , a different , yet far better virtual world movie . The ending was pretty useless . It really answered no questions , and ( heaven forbid ! ) left the way open for a possible sequel . And another thing , the title had nothing to do with the movie other than the lab resided on the 13th floor , and every once in awhile you would see a finger push the elevator button to reach that floor . The scene where Douglas Hall drove to & quot ; the end of the world & quot ; was rather weak as well . As he stood there talking on his cellphone he stared at an untextured wireframe of his existence , hokey . I did n't hate this movie because the concept of virtual worlds is rather intriguing . . . they just managed to make it boring ! So that still only leaves two & quot ; cyberpunk & quot ; movies ever released that are really worth seeing : Strange Days and , of course , The Matrix .	-1
I finally watched this movie , hoping for a more CGI version of Fassbinder 's remarkably great movie & # 34 ; World on a Wire & # 34 ; ( 1973 ) , or even something that was respectful to the original story . It was neither ; I was astounded at how bad this movie was.Notes before reading : 1 ) I read the Galouye story , & # 34 ; Simulacron-3 , & # 34 ; BEFORE watching either Fassbinder 's adaptation or this one ; 2 ) I am a fan of Armin Mueller-Stahl ; 3 ) I enjoy sci-fi immensely . I really , really attempted to like this movie , mostly because of the numerical ratings it has received here and on imdb ( and I do n't read the written reviews beforehand ) .The beginning really made me believe I was going to be awed : the great 1930s landscape , a film noir look , interesting-looking set designs , and ( to top it all off ) the GREAT Armin Mueller-Stahl ! But what brought me awe quickly turned into balderdash . The story merely relied on 1/3rds of the original story , with the characters changing their original literary roles that gave the story so much depth . The questions of & # 34 ; what is real & # 34 ; in the original story was not the cynical plot of this adaptation . The special effects were the equivalent to those of a rock concert , with laser lights in fog , glowing eyes , and ( straight from television 's & # 34 ; Stargate SG-1 & # 34 ; - but even less graphic ) wormholes ! I do n't know what the budget was for this movie , but I guarantee that Fassbinder 's wonderful adaptation was even less than the budget for this movie.The story follows Douglas Hall and his attempt to find the killer of Fuller , his partner . Dennis Haysbert plays , with little depth , a detective ( who has an entirely different role in the story ) attempting to find the murderer . Vincent d'Onofrio looks and acts like a slightly-overweight John Malkovich , playing the most interesting character , the Simulacron-3 technician , but , with how interesting the other characters were , this really is n't saying much . Basically , you have a huge cast of TV actors and actresses , and there is a reason that they do TV ( even though some have & # 34 ; touched & # 34 ; cinema , off and on ) .I really do n't know how far to go in the scenario , but I felt like I was watching a really bad , B-grade , made-for-cable-TV sci-fi that was relying more upon capitalizing on the success of & # 34 ; The Matrix & # 34 ; and others of its ilk than being true to Galouye 's story . I tend to believe that the filmmakers were wanting to & # 34 ; jump on the bandwagon & # 34 ; at the time , regardless of the cost to the original story . Perhaps many of those reviews that give this movie such high marks were done by those anti- & # 34 ; The Matrix & # 34 ; fans . I really do n't know . Maybe times have changed , and many of the reviewers may want to go back and replay this movie with some more objectivity.Even more aggravating is that the movie must be so bad in the producers ' eyes that they ca n't even stand to release the DVD in WIDESCREEN ! ! ! That really tells you something ! I commented to my wife that more money was probably spent on the helicopter shots than the rest of the movie . I really wish Galouye 's original story would be given the credit and respect it is due , along with the ability to do so with the CGI effects that are now the mainstay of cinema.I give 2 stars for Mueller-Stahl ( always a great screen presence , even though his acting is wasted here ) and for the quite breathtaking ending effects of the future in the end - the end being the closest to that of the novel , but too late for the rest of the movie to be good .	-1
I 've seen The Wire series recently , if you wonder where I 'm coming from.Outside of being very one dimensional and boring , the film leaves too many questions without answering.For example , why could't Cage at least give his wife some HINTS about the kind of case he was involved in ? Or why when he found the diary in the toilet did n't he just hand it to the mother ? Or why , when Cage parked his car in a really rasty area with lots of grubby and suspicious characters nearby , why did n't he lock his car ? I 'm from that part of California , and I certainly would have.Or how did Machine know Cage was after him in the house ? Cage seemed quiet to me . And where was the mother during all the action ? And how did Machine hide in the house so he could restart the record ? The movie depends heavily on characters who are evil without real motive . There may be people like that , but they are quite rare . They are n't rare in cliche hack movies like this one , though .	-1
Screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker is right on the verge of becoming the next big thing in Hollywood . He was the brain behind such great films as `` Se7en '' , `` Sleepy Hollow '' , and did some uncredited re-writes for `` The Game '' and `` Fight Club . '' All those films were excellent , and `` 8mm '' could have been too , had it not been handed to Joel Schumacher , the man who ruined the Batman series and who is the biggest hack in Hollywood . ( Except for `` Tigerland '' , which was a fluke . ) The story , born from Walker 's brilliant mind , sounds great . A Private Eye ( Nicolas Cage ) , is hired by a billionare 's Widow after she found a possible `` snuff '' film in her dead husband 's safe . So Nic Cage is sent to find out whether or not the film is real , plunging him into a sordid mystery filled with seedy characters and dark , abandoned buildings ( Not a cliche or anything ) .Could have been good . Should have been good . Would have been good , had A ) David Fincher directed like originally planned , B ) had Andy Kevin Walker had more creative input , and C ) had Joel Schumacher had not taken over directing duties ! The guy is horrible.After Walker and Schumacher fought over creative differences , Walker walked , and left Schumacher and Nic `` When 's the last time this guy made a good movie ? '' Cage to run the show themselves . Want some examples ? Okay . When the film was supposed to be suspenseful , I was shifting in my seat , yawning , checking my watch , etc . The big twisty ending ( which went on way too long ) was predictable , not to mention Schumacher and a new screenwriter he brought in tacked on a `` happy ending . '' The acting for the most part is stiff and wooden . Not to mention the only way that the characters know how to express their emotions is by shouting the `` F-word '' at the top of their lungs.To wrap things up , what could have been a hip and edgy thriller in the right hands , became a dull , predictable , and savagely unpleasant piece of poop in Schumacher 's hand . Even if they could n't get Fincher , the producers should have replaced him with someone with an eye for this kind of material . ( For example a Chris Nolan , or a Roman Polanski ) At least then they might have had a good movie . Maybe Walker will have better luck with his next screenplay ...	-1
I still remember waiting for this one to come to the theatre . First of all , the previews gave no suggestion as to what the viewer was in for . When I finally saw it , I was disappointed as the story topics and images were so disturbing and graphic , it was hardly entertaining and definitely unenjoyable . I am a Nicolas Cage fan but he couldnt save this one . The whole idea of his going undercover as a lover of deviant and illegal pornographic film to solve a case is a little much to believe . Especially when he has a wife and child at home . It reminded me of how Al Pacino 's character in & quot ; Cruising & quot ; , went undercover as a frequenter of low-life , s & amp ; m , gay bars to catch a murderer of homosexuals . Who would volunteer to do that ? Cage 's character becomes obsessed and mentally disturbed by everything he sees but ultimately solves the case . The tone is set with the scene where Cage first views the & quot ; snuff & quot ; film of the murder . The way he reacts to it is how you will probably react to most of the movie , Shocked and sickened . The story is unpleasant and by the time the climax arrives , you 'll probably be as numb as Cage 's character . It 's an experience all right , but not a good one .	-1
This film is about the fakest snuff ever seen . I have n't laughed this hard at mock depravity since I saw an Insane Clown Posse music video.If the acting was any worse , I 'd want them to kill me.However , what it lacks in conviction , emotion , articulation , and sincerity , it does manage to be stylish.But seriously- likening the whole SM scene to crazed murderers is really not fair . It 's just more garbage pumped out to sustain a stereotype.This is not disturbing . If you think it is , you have n't seen much . Go rent & quot ; Ilsa , she wolf of the SS , & quot ; and then tell me this is disturbing . Rebeca on Sunnybrook Farm scared me more than this did . Barney and friends made me quiver in fear , this only put me to sleep.Something with substance , such as American Beuaty , Titus , or Magnolia should be garnering attention . This pretentious poof should be forgotten.Unless of course you 're into mental slumming .	-1
Although I was originally impressed by this film , the more I view it ( on an excellent DVD , by the way ) , the more it seems like a self-indulgent , over acted bit of muck.Schumacher , the director , apparently gets his kicks out of brazenly teasing his audience with his moral outrages coupled with plenty S & amp ; M sexThe musical score is very unusual and quite impressive though .	-1
I guess this is a teen girl film or something , but here is my utterly valueless opinion not being one : Flaw one : what 's the point ? A girl commits herself to an institution . Winona Ryder acts crazy , Angelina Jolie acts crazy , they all act crazy ... .but is n't that what real & quot ; crazy & quot ; people do : ACT crazy ? Basically the people in institutions are playing the game that the doctors set up for them ; they accept their diagnosis as legitimate , take the prescribed psychotropic drugs and electroshock and indulge their & quot ; illness & quot ; as an excuse to vegitate . Basically there is no such thing as mental illness and this film , though unintentionally , drives that fact home.Winona Rider is the & quot ; good & quot ; luny while Angelina Jolie is the & quot ; bad & quot ; luny and they are all playing the game of being suicidal as the doctors indulge their patients ' mind games . This scenario set in the 1960 's has 2 scenes of infinite irony : One , the cab driver says if Rider 's character needs to be committed for seeing things then John Lennon does too . 2 : her boyfriend comes to take her away to Canada where he 's going to avoid the draft . He really drives the nail into this whole mental illness game and speaks the truth to Rider 's character : you 're not crazy . Who are these people to say who 's normal ... indeed.The rest of the film is predictable overly sentimental soap opera . There is no depth to the psychology of the characters ; believe it or not they consider watching & quot ; The Wizard of Oz & quot ; to be some secret communal nirvana experience . That 's as deep as it goes . Also a word on setting consistency : watch the scene when money is displayed ; though the director uses 1960 's cars , he does n't notice the obvious -- the big faced 1990s bills are used for a scene supposedly set in the 1960s . But do n't worry ; to let you know what era it is they show the totally irrelevant ( to this film ) King assassination . Finally a note on the acting . The easiest thing in the world is to act like someone who 's stupid or crazy . They act crazy pretty well , acting as if stupidity were a virtue . For a much better true story showing the abuse of psychiatry see the film , Francis , starring Jessica Lange .	-1
Winona Ryder is far from my favorite actress . I can praise her work in films like Beetle Juice , Lucas and Edward Scissorhands , but I must utterly dismiss her for lackluster performances in films like Age of Innocence and Aliens 4 . In Girl Interrupted Ryder is quite good , but the film is a mixed bag that is dominated by an almost over-the-top , though affecting performance by Angelie Jolie ( as Lisa ) . Her performance is the type of take no prisoners work which sometimes is richly rewarded by the Oscar folks ( and of course , was ) . It 's also the reason to keep watching this film which offers nothing particularly new , but might connect and offer some solace to those who have ever felt alienated by not playing by someone else 's idea of the rules.The film features folks in supporting roles like Whoopie Goldberg and Vanessa Redgrave who are n't given much to do and therefore act like they are picking up a check for a t.v . movie of the week.I do n't fault them so much for that , because much of Girl Interrupted feels very much like a t.v . movie of the week or an Afterschool Special . It plays sometimes like a softer , gentler , One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest.What I really fault the film for is in it 's numerous continuity errors . I mean glaringly obvious ones that make me wonder if anyone other than Ryder cared as deeply for this project as we 've been led to believe . Supposedly ( and I 've no reason to disbelieve it ) Ryder worked for nearly 7 years to hold onto this project and see that it was brought it to the screen with the care and reverence she felt it deserved . To insure this , she became one of the producers of the project and probably partially financed the rights to the book and most likely sacrificed her normal star salary.The book is written as a string of vignettes , and author Susanna Kayson has a prose voice for capturing small personal details . The vignettes and thoughts add up to make a very affecting book , but the book does n't have a strong narrative . To make a film of the book a more conventional narrative was needed . This narrative could have sharply skewered psychiatry , or become a feminist One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest , creating some evil psychiatrist or Nurse Ratchet character.To it 's credit the film does n't do this . It stays truer to the source material than that . When some rich parents ca n't communicate with their children , they sometimes let psychiatric hospitals do their work for them . And that 's essentially the story that is told here.The hospital is not a Snake Pit kind of place . But it is a cold , and sometimes heartless institution . The movie makes the point that one of the main reasons Kaysen was committed to McLean was her possible promiscuity , and her depression which ended with a half hearted suicide attempt involving aspirin and vodka . Men have rarely been considered mentally disturbed for their promiscuity .The film also to its credit does n't romanticize insanity either . We meet characters who are troubled without thinking they are very ` cool ' or destined to be artistic outcasts . Yet we do n't have anyone who warrants our sympathy in terms of a central character . After all , Kaysen admitted herself to the institution , and its clear she was smart enough to pretty quickly play the game well enough to get herself released if she decided it was better dealing with the turbulent 1960 's on the outside , then the cold instutionalism of a high class mental institution . And Ryder 's performances is quiet and even . She let 's Jolie as Lisa and some of the other characters over-emote around her . That 's to her credit on the one hand , but it does n't help us as audience members to care all that much about her.As the central figure of film , rather than as the narrator of the book , Kaysen is who we are most focused on . And she is the least troubled of nearly anyone we meet . We know she 's in pretty good shape and in fact becomes a surrogate big sister to some of the other in-mates in the institution . So where 's the suspenseful conflict ? We know there is n't a really big problem , and we know she is n't in any great danger . Some of the other characters clearly have some major issues , but we do n't get to know or care very much about them.And then there are the continuity errors to really bother those who are paying attention . There are a couple of scenes where you 'll see Ryder as Kaysen lighting a cigarette and smoking and then a few moments later , lighting another cigarette . She 's rarely without a cigarette but to show her constantly lighting up cigarettes is pretty ridiculous , particularly since in one case she 's in the back of a cab , and if she were rapidly chain-smoking , the cab would be thick with smoke , which it isn't.Another one that really bothered me , was later in the film , ( and so as not spoil anything I wo n't go into great details about what else is going in ) , we learn Angelina Jolie as the sociopath Lisa really despises cats . A cat that follows Ryder out for a walk , but when she returns , the cat is inside the apartment where Lisa ( Jolie ) is . Lisa would n't have let the cat back in-she hates cats.. it 's a mistake and mistakes happen but this film is full of continuity errors , which shows a real sloppiness on the director , and editors part.I could n't help but think of times of Jack Arnold 's cult campy classic Switchblade Sisters when Angeline Jolie as Lisa was on screen . She 's chewing the scenery in a barely disguised variation on a bad girl from reform school type of performaance which would have been right at home in a 50 's juvie film or a 70 's woman in prison film.And I could n't help thinking that although parts of Girl Interrupted are well done , and well acted , I would have much rather been watching One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest or even Switchblade Sisters , then this film.Chris Jarmick Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

I agree with the Amazon reviewers first two points . its a coocoo 's nest setup and actors love to play loonies so they can get away with over blown performances.would you pay money to be locked in the room with a borderline personality ? HELL NO ! ! ! in real life borderlines are incurable . theyre damage too severe - their personalities too scrambled . fortunately this movie is very inconsistant - and plays fast and loose with the actual mental illness part of the story.really the story is about actresses . you get a borish depressed winona and an agressive bitchy angelina . you may find that entertaining . but i found it dull and annoying .	-1
This movie was terrible . I thought Angelina Jolie 's acting was completely unbelievable . The problem with Winona Ryder is that you can never forget that she is Winona Ryder . Whoopie gave a credible performance but could not save this horrible film . Skip this film !	-1
Another film worth watching just for the performances as both Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder are excellent . I guess I can see why Jolie won the Oscar -- her role was showy and flashy -- but there is now no doubt in my mind that Chloe Sevigny was robbed . As for the film itself , it obviously strives to be a female version of & quot ; One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest & quot ; but the film never attains the impact of the classic because it 's muddled and directionless . And the dialogue is clunky to boot . This is the type of movie where characters are constructed by giving them situations in which they have to argue and throw out descriptive accusations/criticisms at one another . There are a number of moments when the film becomes profound -- such as the examination of how certain actions from boys are perceived as rebellious but the same actions from a girl would be considered insane . I also liked Vanessa Redgrave 's monologue about the fine line between sanity and insanity -- that insanity is really just the overindulgence of one 's own preoccupations . But ironically , that point only serves to weaken the movie as it raises the question of how people so preoccupied with themselves can make such incisive observations about one another .	-1
In a movie that is 127 minutes long , we should be given a clear explanation of why Winona Ryder 's character belongs in a mental hospital . Instead , we 're thrown into the middle of everything , when her parents are considering the option of admitting her into the insane asylum.The predictability of & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; does n't help itself at all . Of course , she does n't think that she belongs in a ward , even though she admitted to her doctor that she swallowed an entire carton of aspirin , and that was before she drank a bottle of vodka , all because she had a headache . All movies in this category ( and believe me , there are more than you would think ) have the inmate going through a period of denial leading up to an eventual feeling of belonging.The character development behind almost everyone in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; ended up being another very weak link , and , in a very dark drama that is based on a true story , this is a critical element that just is n't up to par , and that really hurts it . Like I said earlier , we need to know why Winona Ryder 's character is going through this stage of depression , and we need to know what part of the phase is so unbearable that she ca n't handle it on her own . I remember the word & quot ; blue & quot ; being used when her feelings were being described , and that word falls short of description that would constitute someone needing to go to a mental institution . In a big world like this , there are people that are n't able to cope with certain things all by themselves , and that is what her character is supposed to evoke . In reality , I know of two people who have been through experiences in life that were too difficult to be dealt with alone , and , when the topic of the drama that they are going through comes up , the word & quot ; blue & quot ; would n't be enough to describe what they were going through . She is playing a 17-18 year old ( even though she was 28 during the filming ) in 1967 who is dealing with the problems that everyone faces at that age . Everyone faces those problems , and everyone deals with them . It 's a little thing called the real world , and , if her character ca n't adjust to it , then I , as the viewer , do n't care whether or not she gets over her problem or not , because it all comes off as a bunch of complaining.Acting was n't good either . Angelina Jolie was supposed to appear to be insane , but her character was really just an idiot , which is completely different from insanity . Jack Nicholson in & quot ; The Shining & quot ; is insanity ; Angelina Jolie in & quot ; Girl , Interrupted & quot ; is an idiot . At one point in the movie , an inmate told someone to call her a cab , and he called her cab , as it were a name , and she went bizerk , laughing . Insane ? No . Idiotic ? Very.So , overall , I have enough real problems and complaints now , and I do n't need to hear the petty , superficial ones that are poorly portrayed in this movie . If I were anything like anyone in this movie , then I would go crazy every time I had the most subtle , unthreatening problem . Stay away from this movie . It is boring , annoying and without any strength of conviction .	-1
If you 're familiar , even in passing , with Christopher 's Hampton 's stage play Les Liaisons Dangereuses ( based on the 18th century novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos ) or its subsequent ( and very popular ) film incarnation , Dangerous Liaisons starring the insanely brilliant Glenn Close as the black hearted Marquise de Merteuil and , in my opinion , the miscast John Malkovich as the lascivious and callous bon-vivant , Vicomte de Valmont than you can easily forego seeing this rather inept and not surprisingly insipid modernization and blithely go about your business . Something has definitely been lost in translation and it extends far beyond period costumes and Bach 's keyboard concertos . Though a teenager 's ability to descend the depths of cruelty is well known and documented , rarely is it of the sophisticated and viciously calculated variety , such as is the case here . Furthermore , we 're not dealing with pawns that live within the sheltered environs and cloistered walls of 18th century France , but rather modern adolescents living rather privileged existences in one of the world 's most modern and sophisticated cities , New York . They 're hardly as gullible as pious 15 year old girls reared in convents . Pulling the wool over their collective eyes is going to take considerable effort not to mention near Machiavellian craftiness . In this retelling , both the plot and characters reek of artifice and you do n't know whether to laugh or take the film seriously . It has nothing to do with the performances but rather with everything leading up to them , primarily a script that aches to be modern , yet is often times burdened with some stilted and archaic dialogue as if it 's trying to hearken back to and somehow channel its original source . I mean , how many 16 year olds nowadays do you know of that write actual letters ? I do n't mean emails or text messages , I mean physical letters ? In short , the film , more often than not , suffers from an identity crisis . The actors were more than decent and they did their best considering the material they were given and the soundtrack is n't at all bad , either . In closing , the movie is hardly dreadful and it can be rather entertaining but , again , if you 're familiar with the 1988 Stephen Frears ' film or to a lesser extent Milos Forman 's Valmont of a few years later , you 'll find yourself squinting through Cruel Intentions , vainly and understandably searching for remnants of either film and their respective characters and will be left feeling somewhat frustrated by the exercise .	-1
YET ANOTHER `` INDIE '' FILM ; THIS ONE A COMING OF AGE STORY OF 4 FRIENDS . SHOULD HAVE MADE 1 OR 2 OF THE 4 GUYS GAY TO MAKE IT AT LEAST A LITTLE INTERESTING . A CROSS BETWEEN THE OUTSIDERS AND THE LAST PICTURE SHOW . THIS MOVIE WAS AS DULL AND BORING AS THE TOWN !	-1
This was a pretty so-so movie and boring . These guys make better movies . They need better stories or screen writers .	-1
A typical overused plot idea , and while John Candy is a good actor , somehow his jokes fall flat . Maybe I 've heard them all before . Or maybe by now , all the plot situations are familiar .	-1
I watched this over the weekend . I remember having seen it as a teenager . The weird thing was , I remembered virtually nothing about this movie . The only thing I could recall was Hudson 's unusual stack of earrings on one ear , that it had Sandra Bernhard in it and that she was annoying , and that Bruce Willis sang in it.Well having watched it again , I can see why I forgot everything . This movie is awful . Terrible , really . I was surprised at how bad it is . I like Bruce Willis and was expecting more from a movie made during the height of his career . I would have thought him to really be on top of his game here . But this one 's a dud.As I watched , I kept trying to figure out what this movie is trying to be . Is it action ? Or a comedy ? Or a weird mix of both ? As an action movie it certainly has plenty of it , but the story is confusing and the characters are too cartoony , the villains too campy to be taken seriously . So is it a comedy ? Maybe . It sure has plenty of comedic elements going on . Lots of scenes that could be called *comedy* in the broad usage of the term . The only problem is that none of it seems funny . Not once in this movie did I laugh or even smile . The jokes as they are all fall flat.So it 's an action-comedy . I guess I could say that the comedy just is n't to my taste . Some people might think it is hilarious . Or might like it in a so-bad-it's-good way . To me , it failed to hit the bar to make it as a decent comedy movie , yet also failed to be bad enough to qualify as so-bad-it's-good . It 's not good . But it 's worse than bad - it 's mediocre . A movie that is bad but also too boring to watch.The plot is confusing . But after a while you just do n't care.I got ta say , I did like some of the actors I saw here . It was kind of cool to see Frank Stallone . I also liked Andie MacDowell ( what a babe ! ) . And I really enjoyed watching Sandra Bernhard , for what little screen time she got . She was entertaining to watch . I also could n't help but notice that she 's smoking hot , in an unconventional sort of way . I have to give this movie 2 stars instead of 1 just for these two actresses.So yeah , just a weird movie . I see a lot of rave reviews here , which leave me scratching my head . No offense to you guys who like this movie . I just did n't get it .	-1
I would like to sell it back to you ! ! Bell book & candle is charming fascinating story of a New York witch putting a spell on a guy to entice love . Not demonic like charmed -the Siamese cat should of won best actor .-James Stewart with nervous scrawny dry old grey indecisive man who was NEVER good enough to romance any LEADING LADY let alone Kim -THAT STUPID DUM LOOK ON HIS FACE featured on cover says it all . Kim is always a very sensual attractive actress but should of done more magic tricks.Performances from Elsa Lancaster and Jack Lemmon was their typical usual funny selves.The story dragged on ..location .scenes were restricted to the shop- nightclub - lounge & roof top better suited to stage play-	-1
Viewed : 5/14Rate : 45/14 : Bell , Book , and Candle gets a weak ` 4 ' from me despite the wonderful repairing of Jimmy Stewart and the ever good looking Kim Novak ( but her eyebrows ... .eek ) after their timeless work in Vertigo . I wish they are given a better angle to work under because the magic stuff is quite stupid and boring . It is akin to a deflated tire that makes the going a sluggish ride . That 's how it happened in Bell , Book , and Candle . Moreover , it does n't help matters any to see the awful supporting characters . At least the siamese cat is the versatile star of the show . Billed as comedy , the film is n't a one ; probably it 's because Kim Novak does n't know how to be funny in the same way Jimmy Stewart can be . All in all , Bell , Book , and Candle is a very good looking picture but suffers from a ridiculous storyline .	-1
Am I the only one who noticed that Sherilyn 's carpet did n't match her drapes , if you get my drift ?	-1
Jagged Edge has n't aged that well . The courtroom scenes look silly now . Jeff Bridges ' character is on trial for the murder of his wife and her maid . We never hear the maid 's name , we never see even a brief shot of her relatives . If found not guilty of his wife 's murder apparently the court will toss out the maid 's case as a freebie . Later Glen Close 's character looks up and sees a tired and sad looking black woman sitting in the back of the court and she 's dressed like it 's 1962 . I thought that was particularly lame . The minority characters are just symbols in this movie.Ignoring the court room scenes for a moment I have to say that Peter Coyote gives a stand out performance . I also liked the old cop played by Robert Loggia . Glen Close is playing a smart woman who does two really dumb things : You do n't get romantic with your client and you do n't let your emotions concerning a past case ruin your understanding of the case you 're working on now.Nevertheless , Glen falls hard for her client and the scene where she looks in the linen closet and realizes that hot dangit , she 's got a sadistic rapist and murderer for a lover is the best in the movie . The final scene is quite good as well . When the glass in Glen 's front door is smashed it 's gasp and jump in your seat time . Jagged Edge is an okay but not especially memorable movie . Unless you have to have all of Glen Close 's movies it 's not worth buying .	-1
I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid and being awed by it . WOW ! Daredevils against all odds ; traitors among them ! Saboteurs hanging from a cliff ! Nazis falling like bowling pins ! Guns exploding , crashing down to the sea ! Great movie score.. ! With those memories intact I saw it again last night , and O brother ... As the tango says , `` fierce is time 's revenge '' , for what was once exciting and fun , fifty years later one finds it dated , slow , and boring.Irate comments , though , ensue if you dare state this self-evident fact . Most staunch reviews here in this forum seem to defend those shared childhood reminiscences more than the film itself , which in truth is quite awful . `` Guns of Navarone '' , together with with `` Around the World in 80 Days '' , `` The Longest Day '' , `` Ulysses '' , `` It 's a Mad , Mad , Mad World '' , and `` Polar Station Zebra '' , belong to that curious film genre called `` Best leave them marvelous in your memories '' . Otherwise , it 's a rude awakening .	-1
I am not a fan of Melanie Griffith at all , in fact , the only film I really like her in is & quot ; Working Girl & quot ; . It 's not that she is a terrible actress . She is just annoying . So why did I waste over 2 hours of my time watching this movie ? I am now asking myself the same thing . I was n't sure if this movie was supposed to be a comedy . If it was , it was n't even funny . Griffith , plays Lucille , a woman who is beaten by her husband . She kills him and cuts his head off ... Why ? I have no idea . Maybe she 's crazy ? She then decides to leave her 7 children in the hands of her mother so she can go out to Hollywood and live out her dream of becoming a glamerous actress . She takes the head of her husband along for the ride ... why not ? Nothing else makes sense so far so why not make less sense . This film is just a mishmash of nonsense . She wins a lot of money in Las Vegas right before she gets to California . She eventually gets her big break ... She is on t.v . Then , she gets caught..eventually all criminals do . I do n't know what the ending of this movie is all about ... She goes free ? when she was sentenced to a term in prison ? Maybe the book is better , I hope so , cuz this was a boring movie . I watched it on cable ... .thank god i waited that long.The only bright spot was Lucas Black , the boy from Sling Blade . He is one of the best child actors right now . I hope to see more of him in films . He is very charming . I personally would n't recommend this film .	-1
Completely predictable Hollywood version of the famous swashbuckler , the focus is on the snappy one-liners and the sweeping swordfights . But somewhere between bending over backwards to make sure that we take Zeta-Jones ' character seriously ( she 's from the 1800s , but has the confidence and power that a modern gender-conscious audience demands ) and bending over backwards to make sure that we take Anthony Hopkins ' character seriously ( he may be an old drunk man , but he can fight like the devil once he finds his inspiration ) , this movie lost me .	-1
I saw this movie in the theater , and thought it was great , but when I bought it on DVD , I just could not bear watching it again.If yo uhave n't seen this movie , rent it , or better yet borrow it , but do n't buy it .	-1
Okay . So it 's a Friday night , and I want to settle down with a good horror flick . John Carpenter 's & quot ; Vampires & quot ; looked to fit the bill : horror , humor , and what looked like some interesting twists in the plot ( ie , vampire hunters working for the Catholic church ) . Boy , was I wrong . Certainly , the opening scenes with James Woods swaggering in those tight jeans , leather jacket , and sunglasses lent an interesting machismo , but as the film progressed , the plot and imagery deteriorated rapidly , and frankly became quite disturbing . Some brief examples ... Sheryl Lee plays a prostitute bitten by Valek , the original 'master ' vampire . Apparently , although not dead , she will & quot ; turn & quot ; within 48 hours ; Woods and Daniel Baldwin want to use her psychic link with Valek to find and destroy him before he obtains the & quot ; black cross & quot ; and be able to live in the daylight . Lee is therefore dragged , slapped , stripped and degraded ; yet , Baldwin inexplicably falls in love with her with no real explanation or character development ( maybe the actor 's fault ? ) . The film also has a love-hate relationship with the Catholic church : priests are slapped around and degraded ( at least they 're not stripped ) , and the brief religious mention at the end of the film does n't redeem the basic message of violence . The villains , except for Valek , are indistinct ; the special effects and editing are choppy . And if you do n't guess the three lines Woods says to Baldwin at the end of the film , you do n't get out much ( hint : it begins & quot ; I will hunt you down ... ) . & quot ; Buffy & quot ; and & quot ; Angel & quot ; on television pack more of a punch .	-1
From the very start you can tell this is one of those weird-acting movies where they do n't go into any of the characters and yet expect you to empathize when they are all killed in the first ten minutes . Does n't work , I 'm afraid . The Catholic conspiracy is about the only good thing ... the relationship between the hooker and Woods ' right hand man is VERY bizarre . To top it all off , the head vampire is that annoying guy from & quot ; Karate Kid III & quot ;	-1
If you poke through the customer ratings here , you 'll notice a common theme ( with some exceptions , of course ) : people who read the John Steakley book on which this film is ( loosely ) based hate the film , and folks who 've never read the book love it . I read the book just this past week and liked it a lot ( though it has its own share of flaws ) , and had to see the flick after finishing the novel . While I do n't think this film is terrible , it 's not anywhere near as good as it would have been had Carpenter followed the original story a bit more closely . Just about everything that made the novel special , especially the characterization of the main character Jack Crow , is gone here . Fans of the flick may be surprised to know that Crow is not the flaming a**hole in the book he is here . I found it hard to have any sympathy for Crow or his assistant Montoya . They 're supposed to be hardened by the horrors they 've witnessed and committed , but instead they just come off as self-centered cretins . ( Despite the fact that James Woods is absolutely the perfect choice for the role of Crow . ) That said , even if you 've never read the book , you 'll still find some flaws that ca n't be overlooked . Sheryl Lee overacts something terrible in her role as the prostitue slowly becoming a vampire , and the ending is absolutely ludicrous , defying the film 's own internal logic . Most of the action sequences are done as montages ( ! ) , and the gore is a bit too over-the-top . Maximillian Schell is a fine actor , but his character ( who is n't in the novel ) was unconvincing and obviously merely a walking , talking plot device . There are some heartpounding moments here , like the opening sequence ( one of the few scenes taken pretty much directly from the novel ) and Thomas Ian Griffith makes a nicely scary vampire , even if he 's given about three lines in the whole flick . His origin ( which leads into the origin of vampires in general ) is also quite intriguing . But that 's not enough to save the film.Of course , anybody who 's never read the novel will disagree strongly with this . If you do n't know what 's been left out , you can enjoy this as a particularly violent , not particularly well thought-out but reasonably satisfying action/horror B pic . Nothing wrong with that.A word about the commentary : this is the most useless and dull director 's commentary I 've yet to hear . Carpenter goes it alone , and with no one to prod him into saying anything interesting all we get is comments like & quot ; Even though this was supposed to take place at night , we shot it during the day & quot ; ( ad nauseam ) and constant exhortations to listen to the ( Carpenter-composed ) soundtrack . I would have liked to know why he deviated so far from the source material - that would have made an interesting story .	-1
Mechagodzilla would have been better if he was the villian and Godzilla was the hero . Rodan makes an appearance and so that is good . Rodan is too small in this one and it felt like it was the same as the previous movies . It is kind of boring and dull .	-1
This film comes as a great disappointment following G vs . MG . Many elements contribute to the sickeningly sweet tone that pervades almost every frame : the Barney-esque appearance of Little Godzilla , the romance that developes between Miki and G-Force soldier Shindo , the music score , the new incarnation of Mogera , etc..The spfx are not up to the previous entries ' standards ( the outer space duel between SG and Mogera being a lowlight ) despite the presence of several impressive matte shots and some well done monster action ( SG 's gravity tornado ) . The editing suffers as well , allowing parts of the film to drag on too long ( G 's first appearance and the final battle ) . The score , though servicable , does not compliment the action as well as Ifukube 's cues did previously.Despite all of this , the film is still fun . Its softer tone may prove nostalgic to those who favor Godzilla 's & quot ; hero & quot ; films of the 1970 's . The Big Guy looks good and fearsome and the last fight between G , SG , and Mogera is quite an entertaining monster mash.Though disappointing to senior kaiju addicts , this is definitely one for the up-and-coming G-fans in your home .	-1
I expected this to be more like Spamalot than it was . It became very tedious and labored in its attempts to be funny . The deliberate anachronisms did n't help .	-1
Well , I 've just spent the better part of two hours reading up on this disc from many different sources.BELIEVE what you have heard . This disc is DEFECTIVE . Subtitles do appear on the screen , even when they are turned off.My copy is going back.The company has yet to recall the defective discs . So the only logical thing to do is not purchase the movie.A wonderful film , but this edition is UNACCEPTABLE !	-1
Reading reviews prior to purchasing this two pack , I learned that they are pan and scan and English language only.This is pretty much a massive mistake on TriStar/Columbia 's part . Classic Media releasedThe Godzilla Collectionwhich has BOTH versions of all 7 films in the set . That is , it includes the edited English language video where applicable and ALSO includes the uncut Japanese versions as well . Why would n't TriStar do this ? I guess we have hope , at least a little bit . Columbia TriStar is owned by Sony . Classic Media is owned by guess who ... Sony ! If we are lucky , the Godzilla movies Classic Media released in 2007 are an indication of work being done on other classic Godzilla movies that have n't gotten proper DVD treatment.If you are a fan looking for the Japanese versions of the films ( either/or uncut video and Japanese audio ) , look for Region 3 DVD releases . If you 're looking for proper widescreen formats in the English language , well , you 're pretty much out of luck . Sure , the English dub is `` bad '' but we expect that usually in Godzilla films . For me , Columbia/TriStar releasing these two 90s Godzilla classics on a single disc , then butchering them further with just a pan and scan ( 4:3 aspect ratio , not widescreen ) is an insult to Godzilla fans.Avoid this release . Even at the current Amazon price it is n't worth the pain.I suppose if you have kids who like Godzilla , they wo n't mind 4:3 aspect ratios an English only . If you are a fan of what Classic Media pulled off on their releases though , this will leave a bitter taste in your mouth .	-1
GARDENS OF STONE ( 1987 ) Produced and Directed by Francis Ford Coppola . Score by Carmine Coppola.Starring James Caan , Anjelica Huston , Dean Stockwell , Mary Stuart Masterson , Lonette McKee , Laurence Fishburne and James Earl Jones.The film purports to be about the U. S. Army 's Old Guard who handle the burial detail of veterans at Arlington cemetery and three sergents -- two older and one young and the various women and others in their lives during the Vietnam War in the late 60s.Actually what it is is a great -- though not unclever -- Trojan Horse as Coppola -- perhaps disatisfied with how APOCALYPSE NOW came out -- makes another go at the Commie prop Anti Vietnam War film . However it is now 1987 and Ronald Reagan is reducing the Soviet Union to the dust of history and millions are being liberated ... ... ... except for Indochina . And so we have a great many Liberals with egg on their faces who have spent the last two decades smearing the American Soldier and generally making an ass of themselves . So how can we relieve them of the responsibility of their actions ? Well how about the old rhetorical ploy of reversing reality -- when in danger of losing a debate simply accuse your opponent of being what they are against and against what they are for . To wit : A patriotic American is really anti-American . A conservative is really a fascist . Christians are just like Moslem Barbarians . Or here . Have the main military characters be against the Vietnam War . Instead of having the teenage character be the font of wisdom before hapless adults , have the adults be the wise ones ... ... ..as long as it is the teen who supports the war while the adults oppose it . Portray the military characters in a positive light and not as drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists ... ... ..but only those that agree with the Party Line . Those who support the War are still drooling incompetent drug addled Nazi baby killer rapists but only offscreen . And finally have the main military character approve of the Leftist antiwar character ( who earlier referred to American 's actions in the War as genocide ) when she tells him that she will do everything in her power to insure America 's defeat to such a degree that he asks her to marry her . SEE ? ? ? The Left are not anti-military ! ! We portrayed two soldiers in a good light and even allowed one of our women to associate with him ! ! SEE ? ? We did not betray the country and the Vietnamese people . The Military ( or rather one member of the military ) agrees with us ! ! ! It was not our fault ! ! We were right ! ! We are always right ... ... ..even when we are wrong.Coppola goes through the motions of pretending to present all sides of the issues but the dialogue is incredibly shallow and empty . Really just variations of `` I 'M FER IT ! ! I 'M AGIN IT ! ! '' repeted ad nauseum . A serious discussion of the Vietnam War pro and con is NOT a conversation Coppola wants to have . The War is presented as being somehow different from all other wars ... ... ..but no one ever says why . Caan 's character is against the War because it is not being fought right ... ... ..but never explains the right way . The young pro-war sergent 's position is little more than `` We beat Hitler..therefore ... ... '' It becomes very obvious by the 75 minute mark that the filmmakers simply do not understand the miliary characters at the heart of the film and are flailing to make them appear human . And the Liberal characters constantly weigh in with their condescending little barbs ( It 's genocide . Anyone who supports the War is immature and ignorant . Soldiers returning from Vietnam are ... .different ... .presumably from all that drooling baby killing . Masterson has a ludicrous speech about returning Vets where I swear I expected her to start intoning `` Even a man who is pure at heart ... ... .. '' ) without ever getting called on it . And it is telling that the film stacks the deck with practically EVERYBODY in the film except the young sergent being against the War ... ... .and even he is made to recant his position at the end ... ... .where upon since he is obviously a drooling nazi hophead baby killer , is killed lest his evil infect the good liberal Masterson with his touch.Aside from the score -- -which is truly hideous -- one can not say the acting is bad . Huston as the smarmy Washington Post reporter has an impossible role ... ... .and makes it work . Caan is good as is Jagger and the rest . And Jones could not give a bad performance if he wanted to . The film looks very nice visually but what sinks it ultimately is the script . Coppola simply does not have the integrity to even attempt a fair debate on the War.The film is not about the War , the abatoir in Indochina , the men who fought it ... ... and in some cases were laid to eternal rest in Arlington having made the ultimate sacrifice for human freedom . It is not about the Old Guard . It is not about that Garden of Stone in Arlington and the men resting there . The film is not about what it pretends to be about.It is about a bunch of useful idiots and functional children who made a great big mess on the floor of the world stage and now want Daddy to make it all better and tell them it was not their fault.It is all very childish and petty.HOWEVER unlike THE KILLING FIELDS , they do not play IMAGINE at the end.See it or not .	-1
A problem with message movies such as these is that they tread a fine line between being too much of their time and being universal . While this film caused quite a stir in 1967 , watching it today is painful and cringe inducing . It 's strictly a product of its time.The story of an interracial couple ( Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton ) marrying was very radical in 1967 , but today it 's much more accepted . Things are certainly not perfect , but they are much more tolerant than they were 40 years ago . It is important to note that this film was n't done for cheap shock value . Stanley Kramer , the director and producer of the film , was a filmmaker who made socially conscious works throughout most of his career , so a film like this was a natural choice for him . Unfortunately , the film is so dated and so obvious that it 'll make modern audiences cringe . The screenplay ( which won an Oscar ! ) is trite and never goes beyond a sitcom level . The film plays almost like a `` very special '' episode of a sitcom . It takes a worthy subject and makes it as inoffensive as oatmeal . It 's so blanded down . It 's mawkish and overly sentimental as well , which makes it even worse.It 's interesting to contrast this film with a film Poitier made the same year , and that 's To Sir , With Love . He plays an American teaching in a tough East End London school . That film , while a bit corny at times , has n't dated nearly as much as this one , mainly because Poitier 's race is only mentioned once , and just for a few seconds ( there 's a scene where he cut himself , and one of his students foolishly says `` oh , he bleeds red '' ) . To Sir , With Love never telegraphs its punches like Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner does.Many of Kramer 's films have dated . The films of Otto Preminger , another filmmaker who made socially conscious films , have n't dated at all and are still quite potent in their depiction of politics ( his brilliant Advise and Consent ) , the Israeli/Palestinian conflict ( Exodus ) , and drug addiction ( The Man with the Golden Arm ) . Preminger 's work never resorted to maudlin sentimentality ( something screenwriter Dalton Trumbo , who wrote Exodus , admired about Otto ) , and as a result his work is still valid today . While I admire Kramer 's sincerity and choice of subject matter , I ca n't recommend this film . A shame , as it has 3 of the greatest actors to grace the silver screen , and it 's Spencer Tracy 's last film . All 3 of them are excellent , doing their best to make this pap watchable . It 's a pity the film is n't better .	-1
I wish I had read the other reviews here first before purchasing this version . Where Oh Where is the original grumpy Father Christmas ? What stupid block-head thought the voice needed to be changed ? They RUINED the whole thing.Let me know when the original is released , because I loved the grumpy Santa .	-1
The original I Know what you did Last Summer was scary , suspensful , and interesting . This sequel is so bad , I do n't know what I can say to caution you strongly away from it . Problem number one : There just are n't enough characters to sustain interest . Brandi , a definitely talented and charismatic actress/singer is totally wasted in her role . Jennifer Love Hewitt will grind relentlessly on your nerves , and your sympathy level for her plight will become nonexistent . Instead you will feel as if you , the viewer , are trapped on that island ... .and bored out of your mind .	-1
You know , if they try to be like Friday the 13 movies with all the sequals , i would not be surprised that in 20 years , they make one where the stalker has alsymers disease and I think they should call it & quot ; I DO N'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER & quot ; -Sometin ' Kool	-1
Just watched this the other night for poops and giggles , holy jesus it 's awful . You can see the twist the second you meet the character and everyone plays their crappy cardboard cut-out roles like a factory produced them . Really it 's so unremarkable , so what 's the appeal ? Well the first one was a big success , so obviously it 's riding on the coat tails , but what is it about dumb kids being underwhelmingly picked off by some guy in a raincoat.Really it was entertaining to me though just because how stupid and typical it was , from the opening 'jump scare ' where the white virgin wakes up in the middle of highschool class , I knew I was in for a craptacular 90 's slasher . So white virgin wants to work on school like a good girl until her evil fun-loving black friends have her reluctantly come out and meet up with THE MOST OBVIOUS F***ING MURDERE-I mean sweet awkward innocent JC Penny Model # 12 . The implications behind this movie are laughably obvious . `` Ohhh she 's so sweet and innocent , she deserves to live , but the fat stoner deserves to DIE ! Take that people I passively look down on ! `` .Also in a packed and crowded club the director knows that another cheap jump scare needs to be tossed in or else the mouth breathing teenagers wo n't be interested , so white virgin sees a shadow reminding her of the killer until she realizes it 's just the dark , but wait , it 's the corner of a club with couches and everything , and no one 's sitting there ? Have any of them actually been to a club or did they have to ignore basic club settings in order for the cheap phoned in jump scare to work.So eventually they wind up on the tropical island for some stupid trivia thing with the worst hosts ever , for CREEP FACTOR we have to have the hotel staff be antisocial and intrusive , the maid for example ignores white virgin , `` oooooh , how creepy , she does n't respond '' F*** you that 's stupid . Then they meet the hotel owner who glares at them and basically makes them feel as unwelcome as possible , even though his business seems to be going into the crapper . Then they meet Jack Black playing himself , and the guy seems friendly enough , basically offering the guests some marijuana if they need some , then Tiesha is all like 'get away from me you smelly hippie ' , there goes what little amount of empathy I had for these characters.So much more stupid crap happens without a shred of thought or time put into the production , even the kills are PG-13 caliber ( well by today 's standards ) and we often cut back to Freddie Prince Jr. doing , something ? I do n't really know what he just has a bad feeling and runs around , apparently as fan service to the girls watching . Then we get more standard cookie-cutter unorignal scenes such as NO ONE BELIEVING WHITE VIRGIN GURRL , or Token black guy is the first of them to get offed and no one seems to care.Then later we meed biker chick who runs the bar , and while virgin white gurrrl lives , random biker chick is killed off , because the white suburb kids watching need to know that that lifestyle is looked down upon and you 'll likely get murdered if you live like that . Token black girl living was only a treat for virgin white girl because no one else really cared about her character.So OH NO CREEPY AWKWARD WHITE DUDE TURNS OUT TO BE THE MURDERER , no f***ing s*** , who did n't see that coming a mile away ? Then he disappears throughout the second half of the movie and only pops in once in awhile to remind the audience `` hey I 'm still here '' , then finally shows that he 's the bad guy to the last retard in the audience who could n't tell and puts his EVIL FACE ! ! ! on . This wimp is the least threating villain ever , and his dad comes up and f***s him in the ass or whatever , I stopped paying attention at this point , this movie SUCKS ! I put as much thought into this review as they did into this movie .	-1
Why do some directors and writers of horror movies think it 's fair to completely annoy their audiences with these ambiguous endings , so that even though you may have enjoyed the movie , you hate the resolution ! It 's such a cop out . It 's like they 're telling you , the third in the series is coming out . Unfortunately , this particular series should probably stop . I liked the first movie a lot ; it was suspenseful , imaginative , and pretty scary . The acting was generally better too . This time around , the acting and script are pretty irritating . First of all , anyone who knows their geography will get a big clue early in the film . Secondly , Freddie Prinze 's character is such a jerk in the beginning , you ca n't believe his sudden transformation . Third , I figured out the villain very early in the film , so there was little suspense . The acting overall is lame ; Jennifer Love Hewitt has decided to join Neve Campbell in the & quot ; I 'm only doing this for the money , and I 'm really wasting my time in this silly horror movie. & quot ; She does look a lot like Kate Jackson in this one , though . Freddie Prinze is absolutely awful , completely unconvincing , and a pretty shoddy hero , to boot . The guy who plays Titus is an offensive , stereotypical insult to intelligent viewers , providing none of the comic relief the director obviously wanted . Jeffrey Combs , who was so good in the & quot ; Reanimator & quot ; movies looks as bored as Miss Hewitt , and does nothing to pad his resume . Three actors do manage to rise above their material : Jennifer Esposito as Nancy , the barmaid is very good ; Brandy is surprisingly effective as Julie 's best friend , although her character does become annoying and stupid ; and Matthew Settle as the good-natured Bill is very effective . I still think Gorton 's should sue for using their fisherman image , but it is a horror movie . That 's what so sad . It could have been a lot better , but it 's too predictable and a little too gory , as well . When all is said and done , & quot ; Halloween & quot ; and & quot ; A Nightmare on Elm Street & quot ; ( the first in the series ) are still the benchmarks for modern horror movies !	-1
Director : Danny CannonCast : Jennifer Love Hewitt , Freddie Prinze Jr. , Brandy Norwood , Mekhi Phifer , Muse Watson , Bill Cobbs , Mathew Settle , Jeffrey Combs , Jennifer Esposito.Running Time : 100 minutesRated R for intense terror violence and gore , strong language and some drug use.It might not have been the greatest movie ever made but , thanks to the canny direction and score , `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' was a very effective thriller . Shame the same ca n't be said of this sequel , which crams in every slasher clich & eacute ; known to man with such little awareness of how hackneyed it all is that it actually seems to believe this is scary stuff . In a fit of apparent desperation , writer Trey Callaway packs Julie ( Hewitt ) , survivor of the first film , off to an island in the Bahamas when she wins a holiday thanks to a radio show calling her number . Joining her is fish-faced Karla ( Brandy ) , her boyfriend Tyrell ( Mekhi Pfeiffer , who I seem to remember used to have a promising career ) and spare wheel Will ( Matthew Settle ) . Joining them soon after that is the killer fisherman , who engineered the prize ( the fact that Julie 's number 's unlisted does n't set off any warning bells ) and proceeds to slice his way from one end of the movie to the other . There are no boats scheduled for days , the phones do n't work , and there 's a storm on the way ... you get the picture.You can practically hear director Danny Cannon , whose last movie was the underrated `` Judge Dredd '' and who deserves a lot better than this , sighing behind the camera at just how witless all this is . Cannon does manage to captivate the beautiful island scenery and the excellently-captured eeriness of the hotel at which the quartet of teen protagonists are vacationing ( it 's also a sort of sad waste of overall possibilities when you reflect on how they utilized these potent settings ) ; a couple good scares throughout , though nothing scary , as if any movie could be deemed such ; Freddie Prinze , Jr. is certainly not a notable talent , yet he exudes sufficient charm and is a likable hero ; Mekhi Phifer , in a stereotype black tough-guy role , gives his role some enjoyable attitude , but his disbelief of Julie 's claims that a killer 's on the loose become tiring and cruel . `` I Still Know ... '' fails due to a maddening lack of logic , intelligence , and most plausible qualities of humanity in all the characters ; entirely arbitrary and thus boring murders of all the islanders we do n't even really know is an obvious compensatory ploy for the fact that only two of main five characters are killed ; technically mediocre acting ( except Hewitt ) , plus bothersome , forgettable work from newcomer Brandy ; low-IQ script ; splotches of incompetent directing throughout ; an incredibly demeaning and character-betraying `` shocker '' finale that essentially tosses this film into the pile of identical slasher formula flicks from the past 20 years . Our only consolation is that it may just be a dream , a la the `` surprise '' ending of the first `` I Know What You Did Last Summer '' ... I guess we 'll find out if and when `` I Still Know What You Did Lots of Summers Ago '' is made .	-1
The Net starring Sandra Bullock was a great thriller when it was released in 1995 . Bullock was at the height of her career and this film was probably only a hit for that reason alone . And yes I was and still a huge fan of Bullock but I have to admit The Net is very dated and silly now . The plotline is a little far fetched and contrived but Bullock 's spunky and fearless performance saves this boring little film .	-1
this film should have been more interesting considering the subject of the net but it gets stuck in Junk Mail cliches and never recovers.Sandra Bullock never could act and follows the Pattern here.a good idea gone frozen .	-1
Wow . I had to force myself to sit through this screechfest of crummy composition , hideous singing , cliched dancing , and stupid dialog . I 'm pretty easy-going with films generally . I like classics , I like theatre , I 've worked professionally in music and have a lot of music education in my background , and I even come from an entertainment industry family , having known Elvis , Ann-Margaret and Dick Van Dyke in my childhood . ( Note - Elvis is n't in this movie ; it 's based on him , essentially . ) I still would say this is actually irritating to try to watch . I kept thinking it somehow must get better , since it 's considered such a great classic . I simply ca n't figure this one out at all . Even the technical aspects of the film seem irritating , from the editing , to the choreography , the direction ( really bad ! ) , set design , costumes ; all really bad to the point of making you just lean back and go `` ewwwww '' . I will say you can not knock the performers themselves , they do a good job considering , and are just following direction.I 'd recommend that if you want to try it , give it 5 or 10 minutes and if you are n't into it by then , it 's not going to get any better .	-1
I just watched this movie for the first time in many years . I never liked it when it first came out , and time has n't changed my opinion . I love the show . It was a near-perfect musical comedy in an era when near-perfect musical comedies happened frequently -- witness MY FAIR LADY , WEST SIDE STORY , THE MUSIC MAN , FUNNY GIRL , etc . But this got Hollywoodized drastically . Suddenly the focus shifted to Kim McAfee and Hugo Peabody ( Ann-Margret and Bobby Rydell ) and Albert Peterson and Rosie were pushed into the `` also ran '' category . Jesse Pearson as Conrad Birdie was far , far inferior to Dick Gautier in the original . ( I never saw the show on Broadway , but rather the touring company , in which both Gautier and Kay Medford [ Mae Peterson , Albert 's domineering mother ] reprised their roles from the original cast . Dick Patterson and Gretchen Wyler had the two leads . ) The subject matter is too pass & eacute ; now for it ever to be refilmed . Too bad . I 'd love to have a DVD of a new version , which would hopefully stick to the original story .	-1
This movie really was n't that great because a whole hour goes by before the car really does anything special . Christine could have had the potential to be a good movie but , it turned out to be kind of , to be frank : BORING ! . I wo n't lie , I liked the part where Christine got revenge on the guys that tore her apart but , as a whole the movie just did n't measure up to my expectations .	-1
I liked the book a lot , and was excited about the movie , but it turned out to be a dissapointment . The characters were very bad and did n't really fit the part , and terrible acting . The car was still pretty cool , but they changed so much stuff in the movie , it was kinda boring . Maybe I was expecting too much , or maybe it was bad , but my opinion is do n't get it .	-1
Sorry that I got this . I did n't laugh much at it in the 70 's and I 'm not laughing at it much today either it seems..	-1
