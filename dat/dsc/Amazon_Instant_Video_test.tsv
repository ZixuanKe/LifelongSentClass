The show is great escape from the day . Watching the boys ( Donnie , Paul and Mark ) with they 're mother ( Alma ) is good for many laughs . You can see the love and pride with they talk about Alma . And it is nice to see Donnie and Mark be put in there place by mom .	1
This season of Archer has been a pretty significant change from the previous four . Without giving too much away , the characters have been throw into a new setting and most of the season shows them trying to cope with the changes . The humor remains similar to previous seasons . The episodes do follow a much more linear storyline , vs the stand-alone episodes of the past that were only loosely connected to each other . Missing an episode in season 5 will make things confusing down the road , something that was not true in previous years.If you enjoyed Archer season 1-4 , 5 is definitely worth picking up . If you have n't been a fan of the show up until now , season 5 does n't offer you anything significantly different .	1
Season 5 is a HUGE departure from the Archer we know and love , but it 's still based around the characters that have become our friends . For this season , simply because the creator of the show was bored with where it was going , the show has completely switched directions and is now open to so many more potential plotlines ! I 'll update this later after more people have seen the episode . The main change is n't a well-kept secret , but I 'd rather not spoil it for anyone who does n't know yet . I 'm sure other people will explain what 's happening , and I 'll add to this then.So for now , please forgive the short review and just know that Archer is still the AWESOME show it has been , completely different and completely insanely amazing !	1
I am a huge fan of Archer ! It 's a hilarious , adult ( as in not kid safe ) animated series centering on ISIS which is a US based private spy agency staffed by an exciting group of misfits , screw ups , sex addicts , and alcoholics to name just a few . If you have n't gotten into this yet , you are really missing out . This is a series that has yet to disappoint overall . Yes , a few episodes may not be as good as others , but overall I 've loved every season so far.This season premier , the only episode out so far as of this writing , was a little flat in my opinion . The reason being it seemed to spend almost a third of the episode running through snippets of past seasons and another third setting up the rest of the season as ISIS shifts from spy agency to what we can only assume will be some sort of drug cartel . Do n't get me wrong , I think there are great possibilities for story arcs in this new vein , I just wish the episode had been longer so that something would have actually happened . Now that the catch up and set up are behind us , hopefully we will get back to the hilarity of Archer and Lana along with the rest of the misfits raising hell and blowing # % * up like they always do.Regarding the FX ads at the beginning ( and end ) of the episodes ... Is it a little annoying , yes . Would it keep me from enjoying the show ... Not at all . We are usually streaming Amazon through our bluray after the kids are in bed . Ignoring an Always Sunny in Philidelphia or Sons of Anarchy clip is easy enough as I am pouring a drink ( I find scotch or whiskey & coke go well with Archer ) . If I already have a drink when I launch the show commercials still are n't really that big a deal , that is why Steve Jobs gave us iPads and smart phones . Check your email , rant on Facebook , or tweet your displeasure to the masses to get you through and then enjoy the show . Rather than getting worked up about it , I liken it to previews , which I also hate , on DVD/BluRay that I buy . I always skip through when possible , but I do n't let it ruin my enjoyment of the content I purchased.Here is hoping episode 2 and beyond dive straight into the mischief and misdeeds that we have come to expect from our favorite characters ! ***UPDATE 1/29/14***So , episode 3 is behind us and the season is still off its game . There are some chuckles to be had , but none of the laugh till you 're almost crying that we enjoyed in each of the previous seasons . Of course , not every episode of the earlier shows was 22 minutes of constant hilarity , but this season ( after 3 episodes ) is still struggling to get off the ground from where I sit . I 'm sitting here with fingers crossed hoping that it finds its legs and gets back on track ... hopefully sooner rather than later .	1
It is a fun show if you like parody and humor . It 's likely that you have seen it or why would you be looking it up ? I paid for each episode instead of waiting 6 months till it was here on Prime or on Netflix . That has to tell you how much I enjoy it .	1
Different but still hilarious ! I am glad to know the show is going back to ISIS though .	1
Archer is beyond the coolest show ever made : - ) i could have done without the 3 minute long spoiler at the end of the first episode though : - ) lol still insane awesome though .	1
Best show besides Mythbusters ! Watched reruns and new shows without a second thought . Plays on iPad Air and numbers 2 and 4 with ease ! Beautiful video quality and I do not even spend on the HD versions . Amazon is fast becoming my favorite download place with Apple iTunes second ! !	1
i love Archer season 5 so far it makes me laugh everybody is so bad at being criminal it 's hilarious i ca n't wait for the new episodes because it takes a whole week but when it comes it worth it	1
I love the Archer series . It is great adult humor . The twist with Lana being pregnant is a great twist and Pam being thin and sexy is a good new addition . It is a great different road from the past 4 seasons . Keep up the great work .	1
There are worse series to waste money on and this one comes with a total end of season shocker . I truly do love Lana and her alternate Aisha . The problem with every series is writing , they ended this one well , but there were points that kind of dragged on and some really old Archer jokes . Again this one was carried on the strength of Lana .	1
Been waiting for season 5 . LOVE IT ! Will buy every episode.Also , a word about the ads ... if you really do n't like the FX advertisements THEN BUY A ROKU and fast forward through them . Do it to spite them for placing advertisements in a paid stream . Now ... the day ads start showing up mid stream is the day I stop watching .	1
I ca n't get enough of this . Every line is sooo inappropriate and insulting to someone ! The writers are genius and I would love to have a beer with any one of them ... I 'll buy ; )	1
So yeh , Archer is awesome . Compared to other seasons 5 does not disappoint . That said I do n't like the & # 34 ; Archer Vice & # 34 ; arc of the season . I like them having their small business style spy office.Another thing I really do n't like is paying Prime and then paying for for a specific show and then getting advertising before and even more ads after the show .	1
Archer is one of the funniest shows on tv . Truly laugh out loud funny . Start with season one because this season goes off on a tangent but I hear that next season will be back to spying . But even this season is great . Just ignore the one star reviews because most of them are complaints from fans who are angry that FX put one 15 second ad for another show at the beginning ... NOT a reason to one star a show from people who love it .	1
I have been glued to every episode of every season . The show is so well written.Starting out a bit slower than what I was expecting . But I think I 've watched every episode of all seasons maybe 10 times . Archer addict .	1
I love this show . Season 5 does not seem to be up to the same level as Seasons 1 - 4 . I ca n't say specifically why , it just one of those things you feel.I still love the show and highly recommend it .	1
this is just the beginning of season 5 and i love it . the whole Archer & # 34 ; Vice & # 34 ; change is incredibly hilarious . the seasons keep getting better and better , and my dad could watch every episode over and over ! archer i wish you were a real life person ! and the actors who do the voices are perfect .	1
the banter , the 3 white guys looking incredulous at the end , love it ! I think the country star line is not working , get back to the old , thinking man 's Archer .	1
I 've seen every episode of Archer at least twice . I love the hilarious banter and the action packed plot lines . Season five is a big change from the previous seasons , but it 's proving to be increasingly alluring with each new episode . I suspect that the creators of the show got a little bored with ISIS missions and I 'm really glad they were inspired to go in a new direction.No spoilers , just a five star recommendation from me for a witty animated adult comedy action TV series ; and like all good television it 's even better when streamed uninterrupted from the internet.I do n't know why people are so upset about the short little FX adds in the first couple of episodes , you do n't have to watch the adds if you do n't want to.Edited : Season 5 , not season 3 .	1
When ISIS gets shut-down by the FBI the ISIS team turns to selling cocaine out of Cheryl 's family mansion . Obviously it all goes wrong.. plus Pam gets skinny and Lana is pregnant so ... Just watch Archer .	1
I do n't know why but this show makes me laugh . I just wish Riley would pick the right brother and I 'm sorry but it 's not Ben . Funny cast of characters .	1
I like this show the same as season 1 and season 2 . It makes me laugh . This show helps me get threw my grief .	1
I just started watching the series 1st season on Netflix . I really like it . The site is really funny and each actor is perfect for their part . I noticed Amazon carries all episodes but it costs $ 1.99 an episode or $ 2.99 per episode for HD . Totally outrageous ! I 'm even a Prime member . Amazon carries a lot of different series , but most you have to pay per episode !	1
this show is so funny and the baby is so cute and i still have not seen the end of the show	1
I think this is the funniest show on air currently . Thumbs up for having a good cast that keeps it funny throughout the show . Some shows are funny for example Melissa and Joey is funny but I do n't think it keeps my laughing through the entire show the way Baby Dady does.I 'm really hoping Danny and Riley get together and stay together . I totally see it going there before this show goes off the air . Her and Ben did n't work .	1
I love this show , there is a lot of friendships and connections that are built on this show and how the group works as a team and is always there to help the other out love it .	1
Looks like the story has finally got a foothold on where the story is going . Well done Kinsey , you 're my favorite .	1
Pretty good show ,	1
i enjoyed watching the show and will continue to watch more episodes and keep updated as soon as possible nice .	1
Out of all the attempts at a believable show with fantasy species ' I think this is one of , if not the best . The special effects are good , there 's not a lot of detectable superfluous CGI and there 's an ongoing , engaging story line . It 's both campy and fun . I also like that there is a same - sex relationship and it does n't have that persecuted , preachy , 'look at us ' undertone . The acting is good and the characters are well developed .	1
Fun , goo , easy , fantasy show . A little boring at times but if you have nothing to do it 's an ok time waster that will do a fair job entertaining you for an hour .	1
I feel this season 4 series was just as good as the previous 3 . But I do hope they make some changes to keep the viewers keep coming back to watch the series and thus buy the dvds .	1
I love this show and this season was the best one of all I ca n't wait for season 5 ! ! ! It was action filled from the beginning to the end with some really surprising moments ! Two of my favorite characters was killed but I am expecting them to be brought back in season 5 because they could n't have really killed Hale and Kenzie for real they are two of the main characters just like Bo and Dyson ! I ca n't wait to see how they return ! ! So if you have watch this show before you should have a marathon and watch all four season before season 5 start !	1
No matter what season I 'm watching I just ca n't get enough and that is especially true for season 4 . I love it !	1
I love this show . I am addicted . It is one that you can watch over and over . It is awsome .	1
Good show	1
Um , Where is episode eight ? It should have been on air on march 3rd and on amazon by march 4th , but it is currently march 5th and , um , NO LOST GIRL episode ? ? Why ?	1
Bring it on new Season 4 . Chris Holden Reid is very , very hot now . Do n't let Lauren the human push him out of Bo 's life.. They need to work it so he can be father to all her long-lived children and Bo can just keep adding her girl and other relationships to the extended family . Dyson can deal with it as long as he has her in his life for the long , long haul AND Bo would benefit from having the biggest , baddest , strongest , hottest and most loyal partner to help her deal with and manage all the other relationships ... Love , not war , with others , is the answer for her global fae village . Hope the writers listen .	1
I like Lost Girl because largely because it has take on sexuality that is rare for a television show.The show also has sense of playful self deprecation , great costumes and characters who are more than they initially appear to be.And okay the character Dyson makes me swoon . Who could ask for more.But enough already with the mystery , who is Bo 's father ? I hope they work that outby the end of this season because I do not want to follow this show to the end of this season onlyto be left hanging .	1
Like I said for last season . Plus , I wonder if they will get back together . Or will she . Too soon to tell . But my imagination loves the little by way .	1
The characters have depth . The actresses are beautiful . The dialogue is realistic and up-to-date . The stories are interesting and the show hooks you with plot-twists and cliffhanger-style endings .	1
Lost girl is one of my favorite stories . I wished it would focus more on making the relationships a little more solid though .	1
The characters are what make the show . The story plot usually keeps me guessing on what is going to happen next . I like how the mix of humor and seriousness . The sexual tension rocks .	1
My goodness , I just want to watch this all the time . I will admit some of the characters and some of the writing is not good but the main characters are all folks I want to see all the time .	1
I am very happy that we have a season 4 with Lost Girl . The show is exciting and interesting.The episodes are well written and the actors are perfect for the parts they play . Especially Anna Silk and Zoie Palmer . I would highly recommend this show to anyone who is interested in seeing plots and acting that are more exciting and interesting then most of the shows on television . Watch it and you will see what I mean .	1
It 's fun , the acting is soso , some of the story lines are soso , but again it 's SoSo much fun , not sure I can recommend . But I like to watch and not soso sure I want anybody to know I 'm watching .	1
Feel good , lighthearted , all turns out at the end , romantic comedy if you like that with simple plot and beautiful Ireland as back drop you too will enjoy this film . If you looking for a plot twisting intellectual thriller look else where . Slaine Kelly to me was the best to watch in this sweet film with no noir .	1
I watched this on a rainy afternoon and it did hold my interest . All I can say is that it all works out in the end ! !	1
I really enjoyed this movie ( must be my Celtic roots ) ... ..good comedic parts and nice emotional pace . Loved the small town setting !	1
I picked this movie because it looked lonely and unwatched on Amazon Instant Video . For the most part I 'm glad I did but it was n't especially attention grabbing.The plot is a pretty standard beast . The family patriarch has an announcement to make so he summons all the kids back to Ireland . Some of the kids are happy about the announcement an some are outright peeved while the in-laws all play the fish-out-of water while family secrets are revealed.The film does have its funny bits and they 're mostly laughs of recognition . Anyone with a family has found themselves in a fairly similar situations . The after-credits outtakes section is particularly amusing.A few negatives do arise here . Some of the scene transitions seem rather forced ; we see more than enough stock photos of cows , sheep and barns . At times too the acting seems a bit wooden but all in all not a bad little film with plenty of social and personal diversity.PS : It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews . If you find my review helpful please vote appropriately . If you do not , then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I 'll be sure to do better next time .	1
You 've got to be in just the right mood to watch this movie . It 's not a blockbuster , an epic saga , or super troopers -- it 's real , it 's charming , it 's funny , it 's slow and it 's characters are lovely to watch . This movie feels like the ending of a good , long book where all the loose ends are leisurely tied up . The sound during dialogue had some odd parts , but that aside , it was a nicely done movie . Ireland is breath-taking , and the eldest son was n't bad to look at either . The music and the score made the movie , carried it . Truly . Soundtrack , please .	1
An intriguing take on the police procedural/macabre child murder genre interspersed with very humorous asides and non sequiturs . This film is a subtitled dark comedy that parenthetically gives the viewer some insight into the upscale Israeli community and urban culture including the pursuit of vigilante justice among the law enforcement sector . Very good performances by the many actors involved keep the suspense high while preventing things from getting absurd .	1
In & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves , & # 34 ; a sadistic killer is on the loose who targets young girls . As if violating and torturing the girls before killing them was n't enough , this twisted individual likes to decapitate his victims ; sometimes while they 're still awake and conscious and prefers to use a rusty saw . Israeli police officer Mickey ( Lior Ashkenazi ) is put on the case , but likes to do whatever it takes to get what he 's looking for even if that means doing something that 's frowned upon by the commissioner Tsvika ( Dvir Benedek ) . After questioning a teacher named Dror ( Rotem Keinan ) and beating him senseless , a Youtube video of the incident goes viral and Mickey is stripped of his duties . But Mickey is convinced Dror is still the prime suspect and pursues his one lead as a civilian with nothing to lose . Meanwhile , Gidi ( Tzahi Grad ) is the man whose daughter was the most recent victim in this heinous string of murders and is making his own preparations for how he 'll cope with the loss of his daughter.This Israeli thriller begins with a game of hide and seek portrayed in slow-motion and played by what looks like three teenagers ( two girls and one boy ) in a broken down and abandoned house . One of the girls goes missing and only a red shoe is found in her hiding place as the title of the film is seen on the roof as the camera pans out . You 're introduced to the incredible score of the film early on and it seems to be boasting in a way in how triumphant it sounds . After the first five minutes of the film , the music backs off yet is always lurking in the background and tapping at the window . It 's as if the music of & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; is always huffing and puffing and pounding to be let in.While the film is extremely dark , as you can probably imagine , there 's also a lot of black comedy thrown in to lighten things up a little . When Tsvika first calls Mickey into his office , it 's bring your kid to work day and Tsvika 's son is sitting there while Tsvika scolds Mickey parroting everything he says . Doval'e Glickman portrays Yoram , Gidi 's father , and the back and forth conversations Glickman and Grad have between each other at the most inopportune moments are fairly amusing . There 's a scene where Yoram and Gidi are upstairs in the kitchen eating soup . The scene is very calm and serene . The two of them are talking about how wonderful Gidi 's mother 's cooking is . But what 's taking place below them is much more hectic and grim . Then there 's the scene where a man is interested in buying a house and has the real estate agent scream at the top of her lungs while he 's walking around upstairs . There 's this very lighthearted twist at times that makes something very dark extremely easy to digest and enjoy. & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; is a thriller that keeps you guessing . The viewer is left contemplating whether Dror is guilty of these crimes or an innocent man and when you think your mind is made up the film makes your brain shift in the opposite direction . The cinematography is very simple and yet beautiful . Something straightforward like an actor sitting on a bench is shown completely blurry at first , but slowly comes into focus as the camera crawls up on the actor . The inside of the house where nearly half of the film takes place has these glorious mahogany walls and floors that seem to shine whenever they 're showcased and the long , narrow corridor that leads to the room where a man is looking for retribution makes you tense and gives you the shivers.There are very light shades of Thomas Vinterberg 's & # 34 ; The Hunt & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; and while the content is incredibly horrific and gruesome not much of it is shown on screen . The film knows when to pull back and seems to know that less is more in that sense . It 's very similar to the original & # 34 ; The Human Centipede & # 34 ; film in the sense that while disgusting situations are discussed quite thoroughly , you typically do n't see most of it . You 're shown enough to get the point across.While & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; will likely be slandered by some for its grotesque nature , there 's much more to the thriller than that since you feel like you 're right along with these police officers trying to unravel the mystery and enjoying the carefree demeanor of most of these characters even when their career is on the line or when possibly facing unbearable torture . & # 34 ; Big Bad Wolves & # 34 ; may not be & # 34 ; the best film of the year & # 34 ; like certain directors are claiming , but it is a well-executed thriller that leads its audience down unsuspected winding dirt roads filled with painful uncertainty and a foreseeable yet inevitable amount of suffering .	1
I do n't think lots of viewers got it . This is brilliiant ! Its not a straight up horror film and that 's what makes it great . That might sound strange coming from me , but if you read my review of `` Captifs '' then it should make sense . Any horror film where the protagonist is subdued and captured by an antagonist , who painstakingly planned it and has the resources and skills to execute it , often substitutes graphic violence and gore , ( what people refer to as `` torture porn '' ) for suspense and tension ( the conflict unfolding on screen with suspense and tension is what makes a horror movie ) . There 's no tension or suspense when someone is shackled up and completely in someone else 's power . The conflict is resolved at the moment , in the favor of the antagonist . Saw is an exception in how they cleverly inserted the tension and suspense by having the captive play a game where he/she has to make choices . Hardly anyone has been able to repeat that formula successfully . What these guys do instead is to inject some black comedy during the suspense/tensionless period , until the actual climax arrives ( and usually in these types of films , the ones that do n't work very well , the ending is predictable . Not in this one. ) . There 's a 'whodunnit ' playing out that keeps you mentally engaged . The dialogue is very funny . One of my favorites was the `` Just take some pain . '' exchange between the suspect and the cop . The end is a surprise and not sentimental , which I love . The acting was tops . All the characters were believable and had consistency and integrity ( not in the moral sense ) . They cohered . They also played very well off each other . The subject matter is dark ( child rape and murder ) and the scenes in the basement were somewhat violent ( but not over the top ) but the main body of the film was hilarious ! If it had tried to play it straight , it would 've been another movie , and nowhere near as enjoyable . Brilliant job , guys !	1
In the Israeli crime thriller & # 8220 ; Big Bad Wolves , & # 8221 ; a bereaved father and a demoted cop take the law into their own hands when they team up to torture and murder a man they suspect of being a serial child killer . And , oh , by the way , the movie is a comedy - at least of sorts.With its grim subject matter and relatively graphic torture sequences , & # 8220 ; Big Bad Wolves , & # 8221 ; written and directed by Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado , is clearly not for every taste or audience demographic . However , the rich vein of dark humor that runs through the work - a humor derived primarily from the juxtaposition between the mundane concerns of everyday life and the horrific nature of the deeds being performed - mitigates some of the more distasteful elements of the film . The movie also effectively raises some intriguing questions about the effect vigilante justice has on the individual who & # 8217 ; s engaged in it.The screenplay deliberately shuns the trite and the formulaic , as it challenges audiences to evaluate their own moral proclivities at every stage in the drama . The filmmakers draw sharp performances from their cast ( Rotem Keinan , Lior Ashkenazi , Tzahi Grad and Doval & # 8216 ; e Grickman ) and always keep us wondering where exactly this gruesome , but often oddly funny , little tale of criminal comeuppance is headed . That the destination turns out to be a mite flatfooted when it finally arrives isn & # 8217 ; t enough to blunt the overall effectiveness of the film .	1
The police accuse Bible study teacher Dror ( Rotem Keinan ) of molesting and killing three young girls . His & # 34 ; questioning-questioning & # 34 ; known as torture gets recorded and uploaded . The suspect is set free , but the consequences disrupts everyone 's life . Later the father of one of the daughters captures both the policeman and Dror with his own plans in mind.One of the big plot holes is what was the CSI evidence ? No DNA on the girls ? Was Dror 's place combed for fibers , hairs , prints ? The film is made in Israel and is in subscripts . There are some attempts at humor in this torture drama , but the delivery and timing seemed off . I felt like I was being told a funny story by someone who messes it up.The film was a big hit at the 2013 Israeli Film Academy winning many awards ( not best picture ) . It is highly rated by critics and fans . The film lacked the big twist and gave us a small , almost obligatory one instead . While it copies some aspect of Tarantino , you can detect it is a knock-off like a fuzzy print DVD.I think a better twist would have been if the dad was the killer and he got the innocent Dror to confess , the cop then kills Dror , the audience sees that the dad was the killer ... then you go to the second twist ending as the cop is arrested for murder.3 1/2 starsParental Guide : No f-bomb , sex , or nudity . Some blood squirt . The torture scenes were either from a distant or showed you the after effects ... except for maybe that one thing .	1
This is about a serial paedophile and murderer who preys on young girls whom he drugs and abuses . The police know who he is but can not prove it . So after a botched frame up one officer gets told his services are no longer required . He decides to take his revenge out on the prime suspect . Meanwhile the father of his last victim has also decided to take the law into his own hands . What happens next is dark , very dark indeed.Now this is billed as a comedy/thriller , I will agree that it is a thriller but as far as humour goes I was far from smiling throughout . There are graphic descriptions of torture and abuse and scenes of torture that are borderline gratuitous . The music is excellent and really helps with the tension , but the subject matter is very dark and even twisted in places . The humour is subtle but some of the ` gags ' - forgive the pun - are well signposted.As a psychological thriller this works really well and that is where I think it should be placed . The performance by Rotem Keinan , as Dror the schoolteacher who is the suspect , is truly excellent and everyone is convincing . So this is far from being a bad film it is just a bit shocking , and will not be to everyone 's taste . In Hebrew and Arabic with good sub titles this is a good chiller of a film .	1
update : i have seen more episodes since I wrote the below review , I must say that James prufroy , who plays villain Joe Carroll is doing the acting job of a lifetime . He is rather tongue in cheek with the audience , just about giving us a sly wink with one audacious act after another . he now has religious followers and he takes it right to the edge of total camp with his posing as their guru . He is simply sensational . Without him , I would have stopped watching.original review : I ca n't say that I am 100 % totally sold on this show as I am on others I 've reviewed here . Certain aspects of it I like really well and others really sag predictably . First off , what works : James Pruefroy as Joe Carroll is the best thing about the show . He is a wonderful villain and even has a sort of evil impishness about him at times . Kill him off and there is absolutely no show . His long time follower Emma is also quite good and is one of the few women on the show who comes off well . The two male heroes , Kevin Bacon and the other FBI guy are also good but they square fully into the usual hero mode of series tv . I do not think there is a problem with the plot either as it is very simple : stop Joe Carroll and his murderous cult of followers . This is so simplistic that great characters and style are necessary for it to work at all.Now as to what does not work : the women on the show are about as disposable as kleenex . I think they keep killing them off with the hopes that they might just luck into one good woman character other than Emma . The ones replacing the women killed off last season are no better . If they get killed off too , no problem . Another problem , this is the most incompetent FBI imaginable . If it were not for our two heroes , we would be made to believe that every other agent on the force can barely put one foot in front of another much less catch groupie cult killers . If they are really this bad , we are in serious trouble.I will probably watch this season play out but I am unsure if I will pick up a third season . If Joe Carroll is killed off , I absolutely will not be watching next season . Frankly if one got rid of the FBI in this and just played it as a cult drama with James Pruefroy starring as the cult leader , I think it would be a much better show . Maybe you could put an agent undercover in his cult . But I sure would love to jettison all these lame duck agents .	1
If you enjoy this new show staring Kevin Bacon , go for it and buy ! ! Joe Carol is back and full of his surprises.. a small fee here to view and stay current , without the cost of cable ! ! So say yes to watching here if you are drawn in by what is happening this season ! !	1
Nice to see Kevin Bacon in such a great show . Not for the kiddies , lot 's of blood & violence . Despite that , very well done show .	1
this show never stops & # 34 ; shocking & # 34 ; me ... and now this season the cra cra 's are popping up all over ... its like a train wreck ... ..you know you shouldnt watch but you just cant help yoyurself	1
gripping ! but often shows the FBI task force as so obviously dumb	1
Five stars for the awesomeness of the Mike Weston character in this episode and for the discernible improvement of the show with the addition of Connie Nielsen . I was n't sure if the second season was going to be any good after I got tired of the cult followers getting stabby stabby in EVERY episode in the first season but I find the second season more likable and easier to watch . In hindsight , this show has a secondary story about Mike Weston 's growing awareness of the criminals and what is needed to take them down in contrast to Ryan Hardy 's probably duplicitous weaknesses and prejudices such as shutting down Mike Weston 's assessment of Joe Caroll 's piquerism in the pilot episode .	1
The Following has a complex plot , which I like , a good cast , and it is well acted . I enjoyed season 1 but after the first episodes of season two , I stopped watching . The show and plot line became too dark and depressing for me .	1
I left a review for season one , and though I feel pretty much the same of the show , I have to say I 'm over Emma completely . There is just something about this character that sets my teeth on edge . Also , with Joe 's propensity toward beautiful women , it is very hard for me to buy this attachment he has for HER . A character I am really enjoying watching is Mike Weston ; Shawn Ashmore is doing spectacular job playing him.I do have to say that I am QUITE curious to see how they can possibly carry this over to yet another season . It 's already beyond absurd how often and easily Joe and his followers seem to outwit law enforcement . A third season of it , for me anyway ... will just be far too unbelievable .	1
Psychological thriller , good acting , plot twists , exciting , a little gory for my tastes but overall worth watching the entire series	1
This is one wild roller coaster ride . Kevin bacon is amazing , and intense . James Purefoy , just plan wicked fun . This show just keeps getting better with plot twists , you just have no idea what will happen next , and that 's what makes it so great . Have fun ! !	1
Here 's the thing about & # 34 ; The Following & # 34 ; , it 's supposed to be a dark show . Cults are nothing to mess around with . If you look at history , thousands of people have died following a cult leader . While the & # 34 ; Joe Carroll & # 34 ; cult is fictional , the 2nd season adds in a look at what a real cult might look like starting in episode 7 . It 's isolated and guarded heavily.I actually did n't think they 'd go to a second season . But now they just announced season 3 . It makes me wonder what is going to happen over the last few episodes . There 's a bit of a teaser in Episodes 7 & 8 of what is coming . It keeps getting better , especially with the new cast members.I do n't know why people are ripping this show . It 's really good if you give it a chance and can handle some dark themes . Yes , the show does have a lot of stuff that might push some boundaries . But that 's why they have that TV-14 rating . It 's not for little kids . It 's intended for a mature audience . If you ca n't stand a show that is based somewhat on actual events , then do n't watch it .	1
I 'm a great fan of Kevin Beacon therefore I really enjoyed the entire season . I hope there will more following/	1
The story so far is pretty good ... I 've already had a couple of moments of disappointment with this show though , but it 's still decent .	1
`` I watched the first & # 8220 ; The Following & # 8221 ; season and I don & # 8217 ; t know how I feel about it . I & # 8217 ; m going to put up a super spoiler warning here for I liked the premise , and there was enough genuine drama ... '' Read the full review here : [ ... ]	1
good entertaining show , but nothing to blow you away . Really good cast for a pretty good show .	1
Not for the squemish but my husband & I both really like The Following . Never a dull moment - we do n't miss any episodes .	1
This show I never expected to like but had Kevin Bacon in it so figured it was worth a try fell in love with it constant surprises every time you think one thing something changes	1
This show is very good and exciting . Love the way the characters interact . Funny how all different types of people are drawn in .	1
Season one was pretty good , but this is even better . The characters are wonderful and multi-faceted . Such amazing talent on my home TV . I love it !	1
OK , it 's gruesome . Very gruesome . Really terribly gruesome . My husband , who watched the first season , refuses to watch the second . Calls it the pornography of violence . But pornography is something that one & # 34 ; gets off on & # 34 ; . I just want to watch Joe Carroll get it , eventually , and all his sick followers . And I want poor old Ryan to be happy . Call me a dreamer .	1
This is a thrilling , thought provoking series that rarely lets you breathe . From the first minute to the closing credits it keeps your heart racing with excitement . Terrific acting by all concerned , excellent plot line and amazing FX . Watch it .	1
I am addicted to this very dark show and so happy to be able to see Keifer Sutherland every week .	1
So , I got ta wonder just how many serial killers there really are , lol . That said , this show is still pretty awesome . It 's easy to forget you are watching Kevin Bacon , so well invested in the role Ryan . The show is really well written , the casting is superb , and the second season really just kicked off where they ended last season and upped the wow factor . The intrigue , the uncertainty , the realism ... .bar none one of the best shows out there IMO . The fact that you get full disclosure on both sides of the equation only makes it better . You really get to know both Ryan Hardy and Joe Carroll ( which may be Purefoy 's greatest role yet , and he was previously the perfect Marc Antony in the show Rome ) . This show may not be for everybody due to the graphic displays at times , but it really is brilliant . As an added bonus , they really pick the perfect songs to play at the perfect times as well . If there is or will be a soundtrack available , it is/would be well worth picking up ( not sure if there is one , which is why I wrote this sentence the way I did ) .	1
Show always surprises , you really do n't know where its going . It really makes human being looked sick and depraved but its addictive .	1
No Footloose in this series , the characters are creepy , unpredictable , Bacon is the only person who remains ( sober ) , focused and can smell out the serial killer 's maddening plan . It 's good .	1
To be truthful , I am a Kevin Bacon nut job , but the scripting is amazing and the cast is wonderful .	1
Much better than season 1 , Seems they knew where they were going with this run . But still somethings were just so far out there , that you ca n't help but laugh at the pair . Fun if you do n't think too hard about it . Otherwise can get a bit ridiculous , actually more that a bit .	1
Awesome ! ! ! I ca n't wait to see what will happen next . I was n't a big kevin bacon fan but I am now .	1
If you like horror , suspense and sometimes a bit of mystery this is one to watch . Not a family show at all . Its a great show with good actors that follows the relationship between a serial killer and the one man that knows a great deal about him . Kevin beacon plays the x BFI agent but continues to hunt down the serial killer . Ad in fans of a serial killer and you get a mess of murders that bring the FBI agent into another another harsh life .	1
This has been one of the best shows on television . There have not been to many of them lately but this one is in the top 3 . Each time I watch it I am glued to the seat wondering what will happen next and when it does happen ... sometimes I jump from the unexpected that appears . This continues to be an investment well worth it . If you like suspense then you 've come to the right place .	1
Kevin Bacon ! What else can I say ! An A list actor whom you rarely ever see now on the big screen , I must admit I was a little apprehensive . However , one episode and can you say hooked ! Truly a must watch if you are into suspense/thriller .	1
The Following is an interesting show . You have a psychopath and all his followers on the loose killing people at random . I like the concept , I truly do . That said , my only real complaints about the show is the sheer amount of & # 8220 ; followers & # 8221 ; Joe Carroll possesses . It seems as if everyone and their mother & # 8212 ; literally at times & # 8212 ; has joined forces with him and has no problems with taking another person & # 8217 ; s life . I get that when it comes to cults people can be brainwashed , but at times it seems a little ridiculous . Other than that the show is full of suspense , action , characters that you either love or hate , and mayhem . If you haven & # 8217 ; t checked it out already it & # 8217 ; s worth checking out . It & # 8217 ; s not the best show on television , but it has its moments and it & # 8217 ; s entertaining .	1
if you have n't seen the following yet , this is a perfect candidate for your binge-watchin pleasure . a compelling and well written series with excellent actors . this show is a treat !	1
it was worth watching to find out what twisted new mass murder and which psychopath 's followers were going to do the killing and to whom.Fairly twisted series of events that kept me waiting for the next episode.The last couple of episodes it seemed that the writers were struggling a little bit for new dialogue and catch phrases the action was enough to not get bored and wait to find out how things played out in the end .	1
I have Hulu and saw Following last year , as it comes on for a new second season which is great had really pushed me to the fact of wanting to see the details of the characters again in season 1 , Please keep this season open ended for a season 3 Kevin Bacon is always a pleasure to watch especially week to week .	1
My husband and I love this show . These guys are always into crazy things . Another good show is Broad City . It comes on after Workaholics !	1
Ca n't stop laughing ... every episode . Just as ridiculous as ever . Although , for me -- sometimes overly graphically disgusting . That 's probably an A+ for the men watching . This is right up there w Broad City for me ! ( Watch that too ! )	1
Ha ha ha	1
Season 4 of Workaholics will be released on June 3rd , 2014.Here are the special features announced so far : *Audio Commentaries*** NOT INCLUDED***Drunkmentary - For Some Reason This Was Cut*Additional Scenes : Alternate Takes*BloopersThese guys get me and my sense of humor . Episode 2 of Season 4 is one of the strongest episodes of the entire series , seriously ! The guys hire a male stripper named Girthquake to sleep with their boss Alice so she 'll be in a better mood and let them have a fish fry for all of Blake 's dead koi fish friends . Now that 's how you `` get weird '' . If the first 2 episodes of this season are any indication of what 's to come , this may very well be the strongest season yet . They 've really pushed the boundaries on what they can get away with showing on tv , a face full of amniotic fluid and Adam and Der 's Koi fish barf battle had me rollin ' . Any fan of the show is going to love this season so far . FULLY APPROVED .	1
Awesome show . Thank all who allow this show to be made , seen and watched .	1
Pretty goofy show . Some really outrageous acting . So far out , that it 's Stupid Funny .	1
Goofy , a bit insane , and very funny .	1
We thought that the kids in this show were very clever , and were glad to see that they allowed a girl to play a role as a smart kid . If Amazon picks it up , we will watch it .	1
My kids loved this show and said they want to watch more episodes ! ! Huge praise since my kids are picky about what they watch . All my kids loved it ages , 12 , 10 , 8 & 3 .	1
First tweener show I could watch with my child . We do n't even have the Nick channels on our lineup . This is a nice change of pace .	1
really a cute show . it 's sweet , the kids are great and it 's actually pretty funny.I hope it gets picked up .	1
I have a 6th grader and a 2nd grader , and I think we finally found a wholesome enough show for both ages to enjoy and it 's not a cartoon ! My kids really liked the creative/inventive side and how these kids are dealing with school situations . Good show !	1
My son and I enjoyed the show , it was interesting and we would watch more it . Would be fun to see them solve a crime .	1
My older children 6-9 loved this show and compared it to mythbusters for kids , which I believe may be a little unfair to the show because the plot was far more than inventing and that kept the show entertaining . I would say that the character development could be a little richer , but the lessons were clear . Thinking outside the box was the definitive lesson throughout . The kids of the Maker shack are & # 34 ; modern heroes & # 34 ; that solve problems using their inventions and envisioning new uses of other inventions . Would love to see this show be made . Nothing like whats on modern networks , and that is so refreshing .	1
This is a very timely show . The kids are great role models . Innovators and makers . And having a girl challenge the status quo to join this group is a real plus .	1
This show reminds me when I was much younger getting in trouble taking apart my family appliances , sometimes I was able to put them back together and other times I could not , either way my mind always was creating things from the simplest stuff . I look at my son now and he is getting in trouble with me now taking apart my electronics and combining them with his electronics to create something new . I truly recommend this show for your kids , and your flashback .	1
This is funny and has interesting characters . Looking forward to seeing more episodes . Especially like the culturally diverse cast - great !	1
This show could be great , but it needs to fix a few things.1 . Terrible sound work . While some scenes were ok , those that took place in the gym , hallways and others were just horribly produced.2 . Kalama Epstein and the guy who plays his father , Craig Cackmowski had very poor performances . Kalama kept mushing his lines in places , and Craig look like a child monster in how he delivered his lines , facial expressions , and his ( looking deep into my sons eyes ) bits . Was creepy not endearing.3 . Special effects can be low budget , but these were so bad it was ridiculous in a bad way , not the & # 34 ; so bad it 's good & # 34 ; way things can come around .	1
I have to admit , this is cute stuff . It reminded me a lot of the kids ' shows I used to watch when I was young . Shades of Rick Moranis ! Getting kids enthusiastic about making stuff to solve their problems is n't a bad moral to teach .	1
What a fun and quirky show ! I like that the characters are smart and driven , and they come up with interesting solutions to problems we all face . Very relatable , and at the same time unique and creative .	1
As the title states , the main character Angus 'Wolfie ' ( played by Kalama Epstein ) reminds me a lot of Ned Bigby ( played by Devon Werkheiser ) from Ned 's School Survival Guide . I believe it is Epstien 's acting and easily liked personality that hook the audience . Therefore , the show gets an A for the cast.There are also similarities between the two shows like it being a middle school setting and the fun adventures and challenges of school . However , Amazon originals does it again by using a familiar setting , but expanding with a story that makes the show unique . The Maker Shack Agency takes shop class and makes it the purpose of the show . While most of the inventions are beyond being realistic , it does make everyone 's fantasy a reality . How many people would love to take a pair of headphones that causes lunch to go flying ? And that guitar the girl made was really cool and could possible work . I 'd love to try making a guitar out of broken guitar parts.The writers do an excellent job in getting us attached to the characters . It is easy for every parent and kid to relate to the characters . Oh the pressure of the school talent show . And the drama of the boys being angry over girls and breaking guitars ... excellent . Teenage boys getting jealous when they see the girl they like talking to another boy . There is always the school bully who thinks he `` rules this school '' , but the administration always puts the bully in his place . Everyone can also relate to the father . Who has n't been disappointed when our ideas just did n't turn out the way we wanted . Everyone gets discouraged , but in the end our best friends keep us from giving up.My only worry about the show is that I feel the writers will soon run out of inventions . With that said , it is a good show with great potential . It will be interesting to see what the writers can incorporate into the show .	1
Simplistic plot , but it has good bones . With a little effort it could really shine . It needs more emphasis on the gadgets , maybe a two minute dissertaion on science and methodology involved in creation of gadget . It is Maker shack after all .	1
This show got me from the beginning , and I am a woman over 60 . The old battle of good versus evil or nowadays good kids versus the bullies.The show centers on two high school boys who love to invent . One boy is following in his father 's footsteps with his inventions . Both of the boys are intelligent , good kids , and when trouble erupts in school with the smaller kid trying to sell candy , and the bully taking over , something must be done . These two boys with several others , including a cute young girl combine their minds and ideas to show the bullies up . This pilot episode is fun , smart with a good lesson . It involves farts which all teenagers love ! Great writing at the pre and teen level , will grab the attention of those who watch it , girls and boys . The characters are well done , the bullies are hateful , the other kids , real kids . This kind of series of inventions for the good of all , could be a hit.Recommended . prisrob 02-11-14	1
Just an encouraging , fun , kids film . Encouraging with phrases like & # 34 ; fail forward & # 34 ; . I adore the idea of keep trying . Probably best for pre-teens .	1
It do n't know kids these days that well , nor the educational environment . But I know that media is cynical and too rough for young minds too often . I have read the bullying is an issue with grade school , maybe into junior high . And that young people per se aremore creative , open-minded thanks to being inundated with exciting media views of what 's Out There and Ahead.The sharp , quick writing and editing and quasi-adult production qualities and topics are right-on . I think kids are ready for it and willbenefit from it . Certainly , they 'll get into it ; there 's no 'talking down ' to this generation as was the case in mine . Kid get more complextoday ( media exposure again ) , and the writing and concept levels here play to that level . Nickelodeon and Sesame Street are goodfirst steps ; this hits about those and carrying young viewers ahead with issues and answers . Hip , quick , right to them . Great show . rc	1
Thought this was a great concept and show , after the garbage you see directed toward children today this was a nice twist . Hope to see this made into a series .	1
Oh , please let 's have this pilot become a series ! The writing is terrific , the acting is perfect - values are taught through laughter . This is a winner !	1
This show has gotten increasingly better as the season has progressed . I hope that CBS is smart enough to renew it for a second season . It 's Facebook page has been growing by leaps and bounds every day which should also tell them something . Wonderful ensemble cast .	1
One of the best shows on Primetime . Josh Holloway , like always , does not disappoint . Has a variety of different topics for each show . Would highly recommend .	1
I really enjoyed watching this show . I enjoyed a character who was computer enhanced and maintained his humanity . I am sorry the network did not agree .	1
It 's an interesting premise and I could listen to the lead actor'svoice forever..and I believe , could be wrong tho , that he alsois producing this series ? Anyway I would watch it more but I amnot going to pay for it..it 's not that good .	1
Well worth watching , it 's been awhile since a show worth watching has been started . This is worth your time to watch	1
My husband , daughter and I love this show , Of course it 's been cancelled just like so many of our favorites . This series was very inventive and fun to try to figure out how each show will end , who can be trusted , and just how much computers control the world .	1
I have to admit I really like this show . We have series like this before , like Chuck , Jake 2.0 . But , here we have do n't have a nerd , etc. , but a real adult . The use of technology is a large part of the series , but not so dominant that it replaces good scripts and acting . I only wish that Amazon had made this available earlier .	1
I 've bought into the characters and the concept.the writers have gone in some interesting directionsthis is sci-fi for grownups	1
Good cast that seem to work well together and good chemistry , interesting and relevant idea , plot well developed and scripts well done .	1
Interesting enough to want to watch another season , though I understand that the network is going to drop this show .	1
Note : I saw every episode of this show via XFinity On Demand , in HD.CBS ' latest new sicence-fiction-action-drama is PERSON OF INTEREST , with a twist . Instead of getting numbers from a Machine , the lead solves crimes with the extraordinary help of a chip implanted in his brain . Plus , there 's a beautiful Secret Service Agent ( Meghan Orry , who guest-starred/was a season regular on ONCE UPON A TIME ) assigned to protect him . Their superior ? A tough , but very understanding woman ( Marg Helgenberger , who cracked cold cases alongside Gil Grissom , Raymond Langston and D.B . Russell on CSI : Crime Scene Investigation ) . The concept of the show is brilliantly executed , and the dialogue is smartly written , with Gabriel and Riley 's interactions always providing humour into what would otherwise be a serious procedural , ala HANNIBAL.I hope the show gets renewed for a second season.EDIT - 10 May 2014INTELLIGENCE has been cancelled . I guess the concept was too intelligent for the doltish idiots at CBS . At least , it did n't end on a cliffhanger , like so many other shows ( yes , I 'm talking to YOU , Fox & ABC , for cancelling Almost Human , Charlie 's Angels , Missing , Killer Women , Betrayal & Lois And Clark : The New Adventures Of Superman . Each of these well-written shows ended on cliffhangers that will unfortunately never be resolved , plus ABC doltishly chose to air the middle part of a IV-part storyline as the series finale ) .	1
I really like this series . Its got some overdone aspects and a few cliches . The main characters are what I like in an action movie or series . The maverick law enforcement agent . The partner and bodyguard that is n't sure if she want to clobber him or kiss him . Its crazy and its over the top , but the Human aspects make it worth watching.Its not focused on graphic violence , sex , and/or sexuality . The female characters are fully clothed and are neither bimbos nor damsels .	1
First of all , if you like action then you will like this Show.This show is not a cheap tv show , the scenes they have and they shot in many different placesthis show got some of the best CGI effects for a tv show meaning special effects ... I give this show a 8.5/10 overall ... and these are some ways to know if you will like Intelligence.if you liked The Blacklist you will like this show as well .	1
a family time- can watch together series . he does have a computer chip in his brain , so you know . not the best ever show , but we 're enjoying it .	1
& # 34 ; Intelligence & # 34 ; is & # 34 ; Chuck & # 34 ; 's serious older brother . Interesting tech , good action and fight sequences , and Josh Holloway often takes his shirt off . So far the show has avoided falling into the black hole of having an overarching conspiracy theory lurking in the background , and the male/female leads are not yet too cutesy in their UST.Ca n't ask for much more on network TV .	1
This series brings back to me the same excitement I felt as I was a child , as every Friday came around and we all got together to see the new episode of Star Trek . It has the same fantastic element to it , which combines my favorite aspects of action , military , and science into a total bundle that delivers a powerful punch.Although the logic and concept of the & # 34 ; brain chip & # 34 ; is far-fetched and completely ridiculous , ( as flying cars were in 1960 ) , This show has a lot of interesting elements that combine.Plot : so far 5/5 . Each episode has new excitement , combined with character development and even introduced a nemesis early on in the show . All reasons to look forward to the next episode.Characters : 5/5 . Even though I do n't really like the main male lead choice casting wise ( I thought they could have chosen better ) , they all grow on you until you get the feeling that they really do fit where they were cast . I think the main partner duo have a great working relationship and understanding , and I ca n't see where the character development takes them next.Special effects : 5/5 . Perfect . Simply stunning . No end of & # 34 ; Matrix & # 34 ; type elements that add excitement to the show.Romance : N/A Nothing yet to really grade on as the relationships have not been defined ( apart from the strange , dysfunctional marriage of deep cover spy and Alpha soldier that apparently goes nowhere . Or does it ... .. ) All in all it has the partnership of & # 34 ; Castle & # 34 ; combined with the special effects of & # 34 ; Matrix & # 34 ; all tied up in a pretty bow called great characters .	1
This show could feature more episodes that are n't about action and more about weird science things . Add some fringe like elements to it maybe . IT 's still a good action show though , with good acting and such . It 's worth watching though because it 's not procedural show and it 's a bit different . It got better from the second episode onward too . there 's plenty of action in this show . And that keeps it fast moving . It 's not a great show but it 's a good one and the heroes here are actually good people . So it 's very family friendly !	1
It 's a decent show , but not very compelling . It 's okay , but it just feels like so many other things I 've seen . It 's very watchable , but I sort of drift in and out of it . It 's good , but not great . I preferred White Collar for a somewhat similar series .	1
I have read that it may be cancelled , not surprised . Always a program that is enjoyable and does n't have gays and sex just do n't seem to make the grade on tv anymore . Some of the so called comedy shows are not even funny . More stupid.I had missed to episodes so had to buy this so I could catch up . Did watch every week thou .	1
Surprisingly good .	1
Love the actors , could watch Josh all day long . Like how the characters are all fleshed out . I like how the friendship between the handler and Gabe is developing . Like the plots . Great show~	1
This series has great potential . Interesting without being difficult to follow . I look forward to watching it and seeing where the plot goes .	1
First , I am bias ... I love this lead guy playing Gabriel . Yeah , I saw him a bit in Lost , but love him more here . He is definitely a leading man.The writing is n't great ... yet ... but the acting , the casting is pretty darn good . Once the writing catches up to the cast , it will be a great show.NEVERTHELESS ... it is definitely worth watching right now . They make it work.I hope the producers/network/writers give this show their full attention.This show is entertaining . I look forward to seeing it ... seeing him ; )	1
I really like this . A man has a chip in his head that allows him to do far more than most himans . He is a human computer .	1
I like this show very much . A little different take from the Canadain version , but the plot is good . It 's not your average cop show .	1
this brand new show is one of the best shows I have seen in years . Characters , plot , director , storyline . I do n't care where you investigate where the flaws are . There is none . I hope this show never goes off the air .	1
A new series for intelligent viewers . Maybe his wife did n't turn . Time will tell as the series continues . Even if has been blown to bits .	1
The premise of this series is that a former special ops guy has a computer chip implanted in his brain so that he can access all electronic information in real time . A female former secret service agent is assigned to protect him . Even though the series is well-written and well-acted , without the special relationship between the two lead characters , it would be just another good scifi series . But the nuances and backstory of the leads is what really makes the show work . The on again off again affection/antagonism between the two main characters is what really gives the show perspective and keeps it interesting . This is one of my favorite new series of the year .	1
Troy and all the crews are really getting it big time with some really fierce gators ! ! This is still the best reality show on TV !	1
I love all the people on the show . It shows how they are hard working people and they love their family .	1
I 've enjoyed this season . I do miss the Mitchell and Glenn segments . But that said , I still enjoy the very different experience of watching this show . It is a welcome diversion from the fictional shows that I usually watch .	1
my husband and i have enjoyed swamp people from the start and this looks to be a good season again .	1
This is a decent show . Interesting because it is shows a job that is so foreign to most of the viewers .	1
This is our favorite show and we look forward to watching it every week ! Since we do n't have cable , we have to wait for Amazon to make it available , but we only have to wait one extra day to watch it . This was the only show we watched every week on cable , so it 's much cheaper for us to just pay for this show instead of paying the high price of cable television and getting a whole bunch of shows and channels that we have no desire to watch !	1
This is my wife 's favorite show . We have a son in-law that is from Louisiana and she pick on him about living in the swamp .	1
It 's so cute . Tommy is so adorable . They talk so cute . I love how he wants to lead the team .	1
I have been a long time fan of the & # 34 ; Rugrats & # 34 ; and I guess I will always will be . Tommy is my favor , he is like the Baby Boss . It is just clean , fun , entertainment cartoon baby style . But , Please do not take my words , watch just one time and you will see these Babies rocks . Enjoy a quiet evening at home and watch & # 34 ; Rugrats & # 34 ; , I think you will enjoy it . God Bless You . Sincerely yours ; Georgia	1
I think this has become my kids favorite show : ) They absolutely love this show ! ! AND , I do n't have to feel guilty about them watching it : )	1
My son loves this show and I think it is cute and age appropriate . ( He is in kindergarten ) The only thing that bothers me is that the kids depicted on the show often mispronounce words ... it 's meant to make the kids seem cute to adults I assume , but it confuses my son . He and I had a disagreement over how a few words were pronounced and he believed the & # 34 ; Rugrat 's & # 34 ; pronunciation was correct rather than the one I was attempting to teach him . My number one complaint is that part of the show ... but other than that small detail it is a fairly good program .	1
My kids absolutely loooveee the first episode ! They are begging me for more . We can only watch the first episode so many times !	1
My girls , age 4 and 5 , loved that & # 34 ; she can make any wish come true. & # 34 ; Nice clean entertainment that could be a great addition to other young children shows .	1
My little one watches this promo often . I wish there were more episodes for her to see , are anymore in the works ?	1
I can see this doing very well for young girls around the ages of 4 - 6 . Move over Dora !	1
My little daughter could watch this for hours ! She love it ! It has a great message ! She shares it with her friends !	1
I watched this show with my daughter who is 7 . She was struck with the idea of being able to wish anything into being . I love that there was dialogue between the characters on 'choices ' , which is something I 'm am always talking about with my daughter , i.e. , every second she can make a choice , from what to wear to how to respond to someone who is unkind or rude . She ca n't wait to see the next episode .	1
My 4-yr old watched episode 1 almost five times in a row , she absolutely loves it ! - Happy Mom in NY : - )	1
The animation is amazing on Wishenpoof ! Bravo ! Very well done.The show had some really good lessons such as teaching children the difference between a horse and a seahorse . It also taught us that with or without wishes , we can help our friends in time of need because helping others is in our heart . Very cute.As a young man who is still in college at the time of writing , I give this show 5 stars ! If this show is picked up on Amazon , I will be showing to my kids someday . Hopefully , the show will be on season 5 or 6 before I have kids . lolTo all parents : have fun watching with your kids . I promise you that you will laugh too . : )	1
My four year old LOVED this show from start to finish ! As a matter of fact , she watched it 6 times back to back . I could n't believe how much she feel in love with this show . Please make this a series !	1
My four year old granddaughter loved this film . It is every little girl 's dream , pretty clothes , magic , magic wand , ability to make dreams come true.Bianca , the little girl in this film , is very cute , wears frilly colorful clothes , has a cute little voice and likes to have fun . During this 13 minute film , we follow her adventures , under sea , with her friends , singing and dancing . And , all the while Bianca is thinking of her friends and how to make them happy . This is a feel good film , filled with color and lots of movement . The music is Great , easy to danced with and I could see toes tapping , and arms waving . My granddaughter liked Bianca 's voice and her easy way of doing things . She could be a Princess or a Mermaid or a singer or dancer . She is everything a little girl would want to be , a little girl 's dream.A series with Bianca would attract a lot of attention.Recommended . prisrob 02-10-14	1
This show is beautifully made , with excellent art and music , and it has endearing characters . It 's fanciful , magical , and fun . My 4-year-old granddaughter loved it.However , I have to admit to being a little uncomfortable with the fundamental theme of being able to simply & # 34 ; wish & # 34 ; for things in order to make them come true . I have long taught the young people in my life that in order to succeed , one must work hard and persevere against obstacles . Wishing does n't make things come true , action does.There were a few moments when this theme was counterbalanced by the statements of other characters : the mother advises Bianca to & # 34 ; Make good choices , & # 34 ; and the bear tells her that she has the power within to help -- with or without magic and wishing . I just think that their & # 34 ; words & # 34 ; are not enough when so much else transpires by wishing.I would like to see this show produced and congratulate its creators , but hope that something may be done to offset the fun of the wishing .	1
This show has a great lead character in Bianca . She is going to be the new Dora so have plenty of dolls and other merchandise ready at the stores . Very well thought out and the illustrations are beautiful . The story line is easy to follow and the songs are very catchy .	1
And so is the script . I enjoyed this pilot very much . The characters are interesting especially Bosch . The flashbacks he experiences as the case unfolds are horrific but allow you to see why he chooses certain paths in life . My only negative is there was only one episode to watch !	1
A well acted gritty deceive story . Bosch is portrayed as a real person , stubborn , flawed & good at his job .	1
Best of the Pilots - Good to see eric overmyer on this project - can certainly see his influences from his work on The Wire and Treme . Also great to see a few of the Actors from the Wire !	1
Bosch is a complicated character , very well played by Titus Welliver . I would love to see this picked up as a full series !	1
Bosch is interesting . The character is fascinating and multifaceted . The story is intriguing and riveting . I totally enjoyed this program . I would enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who loves this genre .	1
Excellent ... .Well done . One of my favorite Cop characters of all time . I want more Harry Bosch . He is the quintessential burned out homicide detective who is still on top of his game .	1
Harry Bosch is a compelling character . A fine detective who to his detriment marches to his own drumbeat setting dramatic tensions that are suspenseful and engaging . This was a great pilot . Please give us more .	1
I enjoyed the pilot . Liked the lead actor and hope to see more of the shows . I thought the look of the show gritty and using the city as a character in the plot a good choice .	1
I enjoyed watching the show but I did not like that it was left unfinished . I will be very disappointed if they do not deliver another episode to provide closure .	1
I really hope this pilot gets made into a series . I 've enjoyed Micheal Connelly 's books for years and I know I 'd enjoy these shows as well .	1
It 's been a while since we 've had something new when it comes to crime dramas . This is n't the standard procedural like NCIS or CSI , as the story of Bosch will play out over the season - both for a controversial shooting he 'd done two years before current time and for the child graves he finds as the on-duty detective one weekend before his trial begins . Great casting , interesting characters , nuanced performances , even if a bit formulaic . I definitely wanted to see more episodes as the story and characters are worth my investment of time .	1
Kept me entertained because it 's exactly the type of show I enjoy . Let 's keep this show going please - it seems intelligent , has some pretty good talent . Light years ahead of the reality show junk .	1
okay - I am very interested.This is starting out as a good story , so I really hope they are able to keep it interesting . I surely want to see another episode !	1
Outstanding portrayal and casting make the Harry Bosch of TV the best portrayal of Michael Connelly 's iconic , sardonic and a little laconic detective Hieronymus ( Harry ) Bosch . PLEASE make this a full length series . The stories are already written perfectly and his fans will love the gritty portrayal of their favorite & # 34 ; unhero & # 34 ; or better yet & # 34 ; unsung hero & # 34 ; .	1
Storyline seems as it has a lot of avenues to explore , intricate and interesting a real bummer with no ep number 2	1
the characters and basic main character connection is complete . bring on the season ! Unlike some shows that take some time to develop , this one will definitely be successful if the writers continue on this path .	1
The pilot had some great performances , which might have helped me stomach the cop show cliches , but I enjoyed this mostly . The acting is wonderful , the story is by no means unique , but entertaining ( what room is there really to innovate with a murder investigation series ) , and it left me wanting to see more .	1
This is the a good police procedural show , great acting , great storytelling , just the right amount if grit , humor , and action . this whould be a great weekly show ... .good chemistry among the actors , good mesh . worth watching .	1
What a wonderful rendition of the Harry Bosch mystery series by Michael Connelly . Dark , gritty , LA and the detectives and cops who have to work there are all fantastic ! We need more Bosch ! !	1
I enjoyed the pilot of this new series and hopefully Amazon will put it out there for us to enjoy on our flat screens.Having read and enjoyed all of the Bosch series books Michael Connelly has written I hope we can look forward to this series being produced and shown in the near future .	1
I 've read all the Michael Connelly novels and loved them all . Harry Bosch is a favorite character and enjoyed following him through all of his cases.The pilot was one of the best ones I 've seen . Can not wait to see the rest . Please vote to make this a regular series ! One negative , while I love the Harry Bosch character , I was not enamored with Titus Welliver playing the role . That being said I would still watch the show if it goes forward .	1
This is hard for me to review because I am a huge fan of the Harry Bosch novels written by Michael Connelly . I 've read every single one of them . So any tv series was immediately going to start a comparison in my head . Is this the Harry that we all know and love on the written page . Well , by the end of the episode , I 'd have to say `` not bad . '' He looks nothing like what he does on the page so that took awhile to get used to . Harry is an LA cop who is very good on solving homicides . He is the half brother of Mickey from the `` Lincoln Lawyer . '' My biggest objection is that this story has more episodes and there is no indication whatsoever when Amazon might screen them . I really do not like this watching one episode of a new series and then left hanging to see episode two for God knows how long . But I am willing to watch more .	1
Michael Connelly is one of my all time favorite mystery writers . I 've enjoyed his books for years , and saw one of his stories brought to film.It is TheLincoln Lawyer and stars Matthew McConnaughey . Great combination ; good writing and great acting.I really enjoyed this pilot of Bosch , the LA detective , especially with Titus Welliver in the lead role of Bosch . His facial expression is just right for this character.I can not describe Harry Bosch , because he is a complicated , and extremely interesting character . One has to experience him in context of the stories that Mr. Connelly wrote . Happily , Harry Bosch is the central character in several of Mr.Connelly 's stories , and his story comes to full light during many of the stories.I do hope that this pilot will bring about a really interesting television series . Congratulations to Amazon.com for this effort to being these great stories to the tv screen . I hope Amazon.com plans to use many of the Connelly stories in this series . I eagerly wait for it to be available .	1
I have n't read the books these are based on , but I will be based on the pilot . I liked the characters a lot , from the smallest part to the largest . I am a fan of police shows in general , so it did n't take a lot to sell me on this . Nevertheless , it 's a very strong show and I will be watching every episode if they make more .	1
This show is so good it could easily have come from HBO or Showtime . Gritty , smart , suspenseful , and very well-acted , it is a wonderful example of its genre . But even if Bosch is excellent , do we really need another cop show ?	1
Gets better as it progresses . By end of pilot , truly gripping . Well cast . Really want Bosch to catch that killer .	1
Loved it from the first scene . Just having a hard time with everyone smoking . Please consider lightening g that up like they did in Mad Men . Thanks	1
I enjoyed this program very much . The acting is great and Bosch is very much as I imagined him in the books . I hope to see more of Harry Bosch .	1
This was a great episode - but they end a possibly not- gon na -be-picked-up pilot on a cliffhanger like that ? ! OK , great marketing technique , I 've fallen for it ! Pick this one up , please !	1
This was a very engaging show but leaves you hanging at the end . I have no idea when the next installment will be or if they will even have a follow-up , but they should .	1
If you liked the X-Files , Millennium , Lost etc . this you 'll probably enjoy this . The acting was n't great , and they crammed way too much into the first episode ( they could have spent an entire season getting to the ending of this first episode ) . There are also several & # 34 ; groan & # 34 ; moments when the characters have to behave as idiots ( why is the cop holding onto the back of the ambulance rather than just getting inside ? Because she has only 2 functional brain-cells I suppose ) . Unfortunately many shows and movies have to resort to idiot characters because if the characters behaved rationally or with even the smallest amount of intelligence or common-sense then the show simply would n't work at all . Also , remember this is a pilot , and if you 've watched many pilots then you 'll know that a LOT of them are downright dreadful in too many ways to list . I think the studio execs just want to judge if a show has earning potential or something , and understand how to look past a Pilot 's failings and see that potential . ( Not to say that this usually gets us good shows ; it simply gets us shows that are seen as having earning potential regardless of merit most of the time it seems ) . As pilots go , this is actually very good and I 'll definitely be watching it if Amazon picks it up .	1
finally an apocalyptic series that do not have to do with zombies . ( Not that there is anything wrong with zombie movies and series , we love them . Its Just nice to have something with original thinking and new story other than zombies . ) The After has suggestions from what we have seen from the first episode that for some unknown reason the entire world went to chaos , the grid went down , communication is down , the worst drudgery in humanity starts coming out rioting , raping , and murdering just the usual human nature when there is no longer law and order to keep humanity at check.But then things pick up and we get a strange twist into what is going on , throughout the first episode our protagonist start suggesting that what is going out may be a terrorist attack , but then they start to wonder if its an Alien invasion , and at the end of the shocking pilot episode everyone starts to winder , Is this Armageddon ? is it the Rapture ? This is going to be an intriguing series , cant wait to see what happens next and what is going on .	1
Best new apocoliptic show yet . I really hope this gets made into a series I will watch it religiously . A must see	1
Okay the ending made me laugh out loud . That guy was like The Fear from Metal Gear Solid 3 ( http : //youtu.be/fYn1vVjCefE ? t=1m40s ) . But the rest was fantastic . I love the variety of characters and their realistic reactions to extraordinary circumstances . Love that 25 minutes in we got an X-Files-esque whistling theme . Love the sprinkling of mystery about the whole thing without drawing too much attention to it.So the real question : is this all taking place inside a person 's head with multiple personality disorder ? Because ( SPOILER ALERT ) that was the plotline of Identity , where all of the characters also had the same birthday .	1
Characters are good . Plot is good . There is everything to like , especially when you like spooky stories . Hope to see more of this one .	1
This is definitely not my typical genre however , I am intrigued ... Initially , I forced myself to remain watching & # 34 ; The After , & # 34 ; the plot is not really defined which is difficult for me to grasp ... However , by the end , I could definitely see myself becoming more curious about the relationship surrounding the main characters and of course the final scene had me completely flummoxed ... To accurately determine whether or not this is a show I could watch at length , I need a couple of more episodes ...	1
This was a fast paced show that kept our interest . It has a feel similar to & # 34 ; The Walking Dead & # 34 ; . We are hoping that this one gets picked up so we can see how it turns out .	1
A well combined cast makes this fresh look at a by now somewhat familiar theme keep your interest from start to finish . I wanted nothing more for days than to know why ? Of course that the mark of good writing . Give this one a shot . I think you have a winner on your hands .	1
I ca n't wait to see where this show goes ... it could be bad but I am familiar with a lot of the actors and their previous roles . I 'm really hoping this is good .	1
I found the characters interesting . The premise is interesting . It was the end that really got me . I want to know what is going on with everyone .	1
Overall it 's pretty good . Some of the dialog is pretty silly and the constant use of foul language loses the shock value after a couple of times . Its seems like the writers could try harder to come up with some dialog that does n't insult the intelligence of the audience.Cast was decent enough . I 'm surprised that Adrian Pasdor is n't in a high profile network show right now . He was the most interesting character on Heroes.If they would let me , I would give this a 3 and a half star , because it 's not quite at 4 but not really a 3 either . If it gets picked up , I would give the next episode a shot and see where it goes .	1
Potential to be the next LOST-type show or even better . A show like this would n't work on regular TV , maybe premium channel like HBO or Showtime . But I actually think this show can shine on Amazon because the way streaming allows a new viewership to catch up on old episodes .	1
Make more ! I like this so far . ... and when are the kids shows we voted for last year coming out ? Thanks	1
ok this was my kind of creepy . I like the characters , love the story . i ended this really wanting to watch more.My fear : this is made by the creator of x-files . Nothing in x-files was ever explained . It was just mystery over mystery . I have invested myself in too many mysterious shows that never revealed the whole story or ended too early : X-files the 4400 , firefly , even that damn Lost.This is a group of people thrown together mysteriously but maybe they are thrown together for a reason ? There was a tension throughout that just got worse as it went . Lots of unanswered questions . Please make more of these so I can get some answers ! But if you do create this , make sure SOMETHING gets answered .	1
This is a great show - draws you in from the start . Acting good , effects good , interaction between characters good . I think this will be a hit if picked up .	1
Fairly exciting , a bit rote . Characters fit into neat stereotypes . Unrealistic that someone would care so much about a phone when there is no power or cell service . Want to see how they handle the SPOILER ALERT alien aspect of the show .	1
Show looks promising , just worried because I 've seen too many shows like this that go totally off the rails , so we 'll see .	1
I started watching and was a bit puzzled on what was going on . I had to keep watching and boy am glad I did the ending has made me want to see what comes next and what the mystery thing was . I would love to have my great nephews and niece watch with me am sure they would like it also . Hope that this is not it for the show .	1
Watched the pilot twice in a row . It was an entire season of any great series crammed into a single 1 hour episode . How ? It has the group behavioral dynamic that Walking Dead does without the zombies . Events melded well at the beginning and by the end have a nice sense among all elements . Constant movement and situation changes through the entirety . Pay attention to detail and the various quirks and motives of the cast . There is more going on than meets the eye and logic as well . I think perhaps Amazon/Producer ( s ) pulled every trick they could to make this a seller right off . It 's never too over the top , but pushes the limit . Each character is well developed from the start and if indications hold true we will see more of the group internal dynamics develop just like they have in Walking Dead ... Keep in mind it has n't been determined as yet what is actually going on . But the local area of incident is definitely in chaos . If Amazon can pull that off every episode , then it will be massive competition for AMC , A & E , and FX . I might even consider changing my watch time priorities of The Blacklist or The Following in favor of this so far new take on SHTF situations that have become so popular in the past few years . In they can keep it up , they can set a new standard that will have Netflix wanting to bring something more and just as big as their current line up . Gloves off fellas . But fight fair anyway . Review by : ATOMKEY [ EOL ]	1
Starts out and ends up with the same high energy , pilot ends in an awesome place . Will look for the series .	1
It lacked focus and seemed to have a hard time deciding what it was or wanted to be . Some interesting characters and lots of potential .	1
The show starts a little slow and the prostitute character only gets a Southern accent after she has been swimming but beyond those points , the show picks up just in time for the pilot episode ending to the point I 'm looking forward to checking out episode 2 and getting to find out what they saw and how it 's linking to the & # 34 ; EMP & # 34 ; effect on the city . Also , was it just the city or the whole world affected ? We 'll have to wait and see .	1
Excelent . This is a serie that you have to see . Good quality and great special effects . Congratulations to Amazon for made this wonderfull production . Still waiting for the continuity .	1
Woo Chris Carter ! I have been wondering what he has been up to . Such a great writer . Excellent ensemble . I 've been hungering for a great show like this since Fringe left the air and Chris Carter is going to knock it out of the park .	1
Although some of the dialogue and characters were a little dumbed down , this was an excellent show . Kept me hook with interesting actions . Dialogue could be a little better but the ending was superb and I 'd certainly watch the rest of the series . As someone born on March 7 , I was genuinely afraid . I may be next ! Good show .	1
A lot of creepy stuff . I have hopes , since this is Chris Carter , but right now it has just a tad too much of a & # 34 ; J J Abrams & # 34 ; feel . Please , please , PLEASE do n't rely on endless mysteries that go nowhere , and tense music instead of acting and writing to carry the drama ! We 're counting on ya , Chris !	1
I really liked the suspense and the action that was included in the pilot . I am hooked and can not wait to continue with this show	1
Looks like a setup for post rapture earth . Could be really good if they really go for it like they did with the pilot .	1
This is absolutely awesome . I loved everything about it ... sure there were a few moments I would have done something a better ... but overall I find it fantastic . I ca n't wait to see more.Just make me one promise ... finish what you start ... I hate it when shows come along and then suddenly , they are gone . And I 'm left in a lurch as to what happened . I am now invested in these characters and you have my trust in completing a great story line . If you do n't , I 'm not sure I 'd try more of your shows Amazon.Remember ... finish what you start ... and you 'll have a fan for life .	1
I was not sure what I was getting but this film kept me watching . I was curious about . Each character 's history and and motivation . The acting was good and there were familiar faces sprinkled throughout . I continue to be curious web out what comes next . All in all , I think this is a well written and well acted drama and there are probably surprises . Watch it and see what you think !	1
The After felt like a cross between the Left Behind movies and Lost . I really hope the writers will give this show it 's own personality and not just make a formulaic knock off of Lost . I could do with less cussing , but hey if I were in their situation , I am sure I would be cussing too and I am a grandma that does not cuss . Writers , go for intelligent writing , not just shock appeal . With that said , I loved all the actors and how they portrayed their characters . Yes there were stereotypes , but they were extremely likable stereotypes .	1
Okay it is the end of the world blah , blah , blah ! The episode kind of dragged until the end . That is why I gave it four stars rather than five . The ending is sooooo very cool ! I do n't want to give it away , but I will say I really hope we get to see many more episodes ! ! ! ! ! ! Enjoy ! !	1
it fits well within the genre of other apocalyptic storytelling.my only two hesitancies were over the crowd acting . at one point you can see the same actress running back and forth to make the crowd look larger and moving . also , whenever someone draws the Christian scriptures into something like this it invariably is by writers who are not familiar with either the era , language , or social context of those writings making those scenes echo a bit hollow . hopefully they wo n't lean too heavily on that . there is plenty of other literature and ideas out there aside from those writings to draw from for the end of the world scenario.at the end of the pilot i will admit went looking for more episodes . so let 's hope this goes and goes someplace good .	1
As with most pilots trying to set the stage for where the show is going , it was kind of slow at first . It turned cheezy when the characters realized something happened to the world . But , it began to pick up with a little more character development and then the ending was enough to make me want to see what happens next . This could have the potential for a good series as long they do n't have any more scenes of people just meandering around with no sense of urgency or care .	1
I like apocalyptic movies , and this one had all of the elements I like . What I enjoy about it is that I get to see the events as they unfold - not after the event has already happened . It 's eerie that the survivors all have the same birthday . I 'm interested to see where this heads . So far , I like this better than all of the other Amazon originals . It 's about time Amazon took a page out of Netflix 's book and created its own original series . Good job .	1
Okay I almost turned off a few times but gave it a chance the ending was totally worth it . The show has potential will know for sure with the next few episodes .	1
Ca n't wait for the next season to find out what happens , this show is fast moving and keeps your interest . Will tell others they need to watch this .	1
Hot women , and end of the world plot . Ok I want to see more . First off show full nudity , it works for Spartacus etc . I love end of the world movies , this has allot of Lost in it which kept me riveted for the first season . Bring this one to fruition and I will watch what more can you say but a willingness to want and see more	1
the ending was so great ! ! I can not wait until the next episode . i also see myself buying blu ray and instant video.bring back alpha house	1
After is written and directed by Emmy-nominee Chris Carter ( The X-Files ) . After follows eight strangers who are thrown together by mysterious forces and must help each other survive in a violent world that defies explanation . Aldis Hodge , Andrew Howard , Arielle Kebbel , Jamie Kennedy , Sharon Lawrence , Jaina Lee Ortiz , Adrian Pasdar , and Louise Monot star in the pilot . The show I thought had pretty good acting and got great at the end . The show has alot of promise and could definitely get better with a full season treatment . The premise of the show is good and could go in alot of different directions . I am glad I watched this show and would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review .	1
Really enjoyed this , and am eager to find out where this is going ! I really hope it gets picked up . It 's the pilot so obviously it needs a few tweaks . Make the clown guy a little less whiny , and make the Irishman less of a random d**k .	1
After is a very enjoyable show . I hope it wins . I ca n't wait to watch more . It will be interesting to see the & # 34 ; event & # 34 ; was ... if we ever find out .	1
Gripping , different , thought provoking , good acting , intriguing story line - definitely should be on the & # 34 ; lets have more & # 34 ; list ! Straight to Round 2 please !	1
Loved it ! I was on the fence for the majority of this ( even with the Heroes and Xfiles cameos ) until Aldis Hodge from Leverage showed up . If he was in it I figured it could n't be too bad . Then the ending ... you hooked me Amazon . I 'm pretty sure this will end up as some junk Lost storyline ; or at best as annoying as Les Revenants but I 'm still down for the ride . I hope Amazon continues this season as I , for one , will be watching .	1
This is what top quality writing , filming , acting , ... is all about . A little slow developing , but it sure made up for the slow start . Packs a punch for drama , mystery , and supernatural ( maybe ? ) .When can we see the next episode ? I 'm telling all my friends .	1
Whoever wrote this series has an original take on the End of the World ! Ingenious and original in a weirdly strange script with unexpected changes , bringing some tensely anticipated new episodes hopefully soon to Prime !	1
I thought the pilot was great . I love the mystery that the characters have to figure out and that some big things were revealed yet other points where made but not really discovered . I ca n't wait for the rest of this show .	1
Enjoyed the Pilot and would like to see another couple of episodes . I liked the characters ( mostly ) and enjoyed the twists . MORE PLEASE ... and hey.. it is Chris Carter ! ! !	1
Just when you think the anarchy of the pilot centers around a probable cyber attack on the electric grid , comes the last few riveting minutes where the show twists to leave the audience hanging ... ..wanting to see the sequel . Easy to give this one five stars !	1
How many sports programs can you say are successful ? EXACTLY ! ! ! & # 34 ; YPB & # 34 ; It 's your problem bro , as the character says in the show ! Monkeys and cocaine taking left overs from the Hang-over franchise is real sad ! Natalie is kind of hot right now , this show is not the get ahead for her ! Are Amazon 's viewers sports fans , enough to carry a whole season ?	-1
I wanted to like this show , but the cliche & # 34 ; woman & # 34 ; does n't know anything about football & # 34 ; to the overuse of curse words just made watching this extremely uncomfortable . The Plot ok , the jokes & # 34 ; meh & # 34 ; , and usual/ completely obvious twists made this boring . Definitely made for a younger , immature , sexiest , and uneducated audience .	-1
Another sports-centric show -- yawn . This didnt grab me and when it was over I had no interest in seeing more . Natalie Zea won me over but the rest of the cast got lost in unfamiliar-faceville .	-1
I tried watching and could n't even finish watching . It just was n't very funny and not interesting at all . I finish watching all 5 new pilots and this might be the worse one of the five .	-1
After watching Transparent , I thought we were in for a really quality set of pilots this time around , but The Rebels brought me crashing down to earth . Natalie Zea is great but she deserves better than this . Everything about it is derivative , from the drugged-up monkey ( which made me cringe ) to the stereotyped people of color to the aging quarterback giving it one last shot . The idea that a woman being in charge of a football team is enough of a story in itself to build a TV show around might have been revolutionary in 1987 , but it turns out , women like sports too . If you 're a total bro who thinks the N-word is funny and loves nothing more than a simian in a diaper , you 'll probably love it . But that 's not a compliment .	-1
I only made it 6 minutes into the show before turning it off . Seemed like it was a good idea when I read about it but the language was terrible . I ca n't watch this show with family around .	-1
Natalie Zea is much better than the rest of the show . Watching this afterTRANSPARENT : The Pilot [ HD ] I realized how well she would have fit in with that ensemble . It 's not too late.This series can be saved , but it will take some serious work on episode 2 in rooting out the slapstick and inanity for me to want to watch one more time .	-1
If you 've seen Wildcats or Major League or any other sitcom/movie where the owner or coach is female , then you 've already seen this . Lots of male chauvinists and dumb jocks and & # 34 ; you go girl ! & # 34 ; attitude . Not terrible , but not the least bit original , either .	-1
I guess it just is n't my thing . I like football and thought it would be fun , but just did n't make me laugh or care or whatever it should make me want to do . It felt a little bit hack to me , but I see it is getting good reviews so maybe I just do n't get it .	-1
I did n't find the story very interesting , and I did n't laugh a lot . A lot of it seemed too contrived to me.I mean if people like it , then sure move it forward , but if its between this and the others , I say this is the worst of the bunch . I could n't even push myself to finish watching it .	-1
This was okay but not great , especially not in comparison with the other 2 comedies Amazon premiered . Natalie Zea is good , though .	-1
After hearing the curse word MF in the first few scenes I trashed it . Not worth watching in my opinion !	-1
As football fans , my husband and I were excited at the promise of a football comedy . Unfortunately , I was disappointed . I gave it two stars , my husband said he would have given it three . The jokes are way too forced , 3/4 of the acting is bad , and I just do n't see how they will pull off this premise for an entire season , let alone multiple seasons . Let me guess ; they 'll have a difficult start to the season , lots of interpersonal relationship issues between the teammates and administrative staff as they struggle to find common ground with a female owner and a soft-spoken boy next door GM who eventually win them over , so eventually they 'll bond and somehow fight their way to the top . And then what ? I could see it as a cheesy sports movie , but not a television show . They 're just trying too hard . If they do decide to continue it , play down the whole woman as a football owner premise ( I mean come on , it 's 2014 , a woman in power is n't a shocker anymore - and acting like it is insulting ) and for the love of god , cut the puffy hair off the lead male character .	-1
Although the premise is intriguing , I found the writing to be really sub-par . I could n't get pulled into the storylines and found all of the characters to be quite forgettable .	-1
said , & # 34 ; Being the team GM is a privilege , not a right ... You 've got to earn their respect & # 34 ; More stereotypical behavior . Stereotypical blacks , blonde women and mysongistic men . Come on writers .	-1
When Amazon announced it 's line up for the new pilot season , I had high hopes for this show . I was very wrong.A woman owner that knows nothing about football , a GM with no experience , players that are walking , breathing stereotypes , and a monkey that sniffed coke and fired a gun . That 's what this show is.The comedy in this show was crude and predictable . Most of the main characters were n't even likeable . If this was to get picked up , if they continue with the same tone as the pilot , I 'd expect more of the same.The only reason that this series even gets 2 stars is because of the Fox Sports Sunday crew and Billy Dee Williams being on the pilot episode .	-1
This is OK but it is so tough to believe the story line that it becomes more stupid than entertaining . It could have potential if you made it more believable .	-1
Do we really have to have another show where people behave like juvenile idiots ? I would n't recommend this to anyone .	-1
I think this is supposed to be a comedy ? I was n't quite sure since there were a couple funny lines , but not anything to make me laugh a lot . The plot was really dumb , and the characters were typical stereotypical characters . How many times are we going to see a soccer player as the kicker in football ? Geesh . I 'll pass on this show .	-1
Wow ... how utterly dumb and annoying . It seems no one can write a good , smart comedy anymore . Too bad . I like the lead actress ( was great in Justified ) , but she 's not doing herself any favors in this dud . Bad writing , not in the least believable subject matter ... do n't waste your time .	-1
I love Natalie Zea in everything she does , but this show has no chemistry , is n't funny , and has over dressed football players .	-1
I had hopes that this would veer toward a romantic comedy/drama reminiscent of Moonlighting . It did n't . While the promise of future romantic drama is there , the dialogue and plot were tired . I do n't want to tune in weekly to follow the angst of yet another parent trying to do the right thing in their oh-so-complicated life . This one was a miss with me .	-1
There is far better writing and comedy in the Amazon Pilot program.The same ol'formula will get the same ol'laughs ... Not impressed at all.There is an instant lack of credibility when the PFL gets thrown into the mix..	-1
Everything about this show was boring and predictable . I watched about half-way through and started falling asleep . Natalie Zea is pretty though .	-1
Not a fan . A storyline line this needs comedy off the charts , and unfortunately The Rebels could n't keep my interest .	-1
I prefer by far the dark humor in Amazon 's other proposed series -- Transparent -- to the frat-boy humor found here . The cast is appealing and I think this would be a crowd-pleaser for folks who like sitcoms .	-1
I could n't even get all the way through it . I was not impressed at all . They should toss this one .	-1
REALLY badly written ... . actors seem rather embarrassed to be there throwing these lines . premise is n't bad , but this is a fumble from the snap . they need to find the handle on the ball on this one .	-1
When you are watching the show , it feels like someone went through a list of items to include in a drama/comedy and checked them off one at a time.And how about a little less stereo typical dumb blond inherits from husband and more empowered woman please.It would have been much better if she 'd been a successful woman in some totally alien field , and then had the team dumped on her by dead husband.Capable woman coping with new world of challenges , smart . The cheerleader trophy wife that rises to challenge has been done and dumb.It 's the 21st century , enough with the women who ca n't make it on their own without a man/husband handing it to them .	-1
Ugh ! Predictable and brainless . There is n't one chracter on this show that was in any way likable . And the coke-sniffing , gun-toting monkey was utterly stupid . Do not waste your time on this one . Maybe if they gave the monkey a typewriter it could have come up with a better story !	-1
It 's so bad , it 's not even worth the effort to write a bad review . Unoriginal . Uninspired . Unfunny . Such a waste of talent .	-1
The worst show of the pilots , not funny , poor writing and actors trying to hard . Amazon should invest in shows that have something new to say or provide plot and strong character development -- The Rebels has none of this .	-1
As someone not interested in football , I thought maybe I 'd get a kick out of a woman who has inherited a football team . Unfortunately , this show was not funny and the acting was not very good . It 's odd , because Zea was pretty good in Justified .	-1
This pilot was so boring that I only watched about 10 minutes of it . The whole & # 34 ; fish out of water & # 34 ; storyline has been done better with better actors then these .	-1
The bar for shows based around professional football has n't been set very high . There really are n't many shows that made any lasting impression , let alone that were any good . Sadly , & # 34 ; The Rebels & # 34 ; does n't even clear the low expectations . The first issue is that , once again , we have a football show that seems to be written by people who know nothing about football . Or who , at least , do n't care to make the show seem remotely realistic . Now , I know that I should n't be expecting realism from a show with a coked out monkey with a gun but the football stuff was n't funny either . In fact , not much in the show was funny at all.I love Natalie Zea but that just makes me hope even more that this show does n't get picked up because this would be a waste of her talents .	-1
I 've seen some really poor shows and this one is among the poorest ever . It is shallow , course , stereotypical and demeans women and athletes . I found nothing to like.. so can this and find something else .. oh , here 's and idea . Make a prison comedy 30 minute tv sitcom ( NOT ) ..	-1
The crazy players are one-dimensional and the lovable happenstance GM seems like this is the role he always gets stuck playing . It just tries too hard and is too predictable . The only thing evenly slightly funny was the monkey snippet during the credits .	-1
idiotic comedy not interesting at all . Under developt characters , there is no reason why she should keep th team . Very predictable ,	-1
There is NO way a professional football cheerleader who ends up marrying a team owner would call football uniforms , & # 34 ; costumes. & # 34 ; That 's when I knew these writers were trying to insult human intelligence.It sunk when they portrayed the football players , most of them black , snorting coke ( at a black team player 's house / party ) and letting loose a rented monkey who ends up snorting coke and shooting a Latino place kicker in the foot . Guys ( football player actors ) where 's your ethnic dignity ? Do n't do this to yourself and your people.Yuck . The show was beautifully shot but the story and the stereotypes sunk to low levels .	-1
nope , so not for me . ca n't stand football and I 'm just irritated at the thought of a someone keeping a monkey for a pet .	-1
Waste of decent actors in an overly broad , unfunny comedy.There is no reason for this mediocre , derivative show to exist . It is too reminiscent of USA Network 's UNNECESSARY ROUGHNESS , even going as far as to steal the joke about confusing football uniforms with costumes in that show 's pilot . Natalie Zea is given horrible material as a scatty heroine barely a few steps away from being a bimbo . The other characters are stereotypes : the wimpy new manager who rises to the occasion , the goofy but sincere screw-up player , the semiretired quarterback who needs a comeback set up as a potential love interest for the heroine , the sexist businessmen trying to buy the team . Awful , predictable dialogue and outcomes you see coming a mile off.The attempts at humor are too broad and unfunny , with every single point in the story telegraphed from way off as if the show was afraid we 're too stupid to keep up.This is probably worst of the new pilots .	-1
Rich bitch suddenly owns a football team and calls uniforms & # 34 ; costumes. & # 34 ; That sure sounds like a laugh riot to me .	-1
I like Titus Welliver . But , this show seems like a bad adaptation from a mediocre crime novel . It does not adequately transform whatever the original material was into an interesting television show . It seems like an ABC show that would be cancelled mid-season.It 's a throwback to 80 's noir TV dramas , but lacking in depth or interest , with cliched , hackey dialogue , and some incredibly lackluster supporting actors.I was utterly uninterested after several plot developments and did n't care at all about any of the characters .	-1
Did n't find the storyline engaging . Characters seemed to do the best they could . Script is needs more effort to engage the viewer	-1
I thought this was slow . I have read the books and was very excited to watch it . I did n't finish this first episode . It just felt really slow .	-1
I 'm surprised so many people enjoyed this show . I found the main character to be unpleasant and unlikable . The case was very dark , and there was so much smoking it was making me nauseous !	-1
I think this is a twisted mind 's series . It has little appeal to me . I do not have anything of value to say about it .	-1
Just was n't that good . The dialog was very predictable and the actor who played Bosch just does n't work as a star . I doubt that I would make this part of my regular viewing .	-1
I suppose it might help if you 've read the books , which I also imagine to be slow and boring.Nothing about this show makes me want to watch another episode . The actors are great , the dialogue is okay.I could n't believe someone actually wrote the line for the Internal Affairs guy to point his finger at Bosch and pull the 'trigger'.This show is a zero .	-1
Police shows are best when episodic . You get to do character development while telling different stories each week . I do n't want to watch 10 episode about chasing one case or following one trial . It just means that the facts , reveals and details will be drawn out and that at the end of the season they will give you one little nugget to make sure you come back next year . Not interested.I 'd give it one star but Two guys from the Wire and one guy from Walking Dead is always worth an extra star .	-1
Beyond slow paced , boring and cliched , is it sponsored by tobacco companies ? A jarring amount of cigarette smoking in the first 15 minutes . Did n't finish watching it . Watched a third and it just never got any better . How is it getting the good reviews ? Mystery to me . Got to be mighty bored to be entertained by this .	-1
I fell asleep watching it and wo n't watch anymore episodes if they decide to make more . What I stayed awake for seemed to be well made though .	-1
I feel like I 've watched this story line in other shows umpteen times before -- the male main character who 's rough around the edges , but also kind of a hero . Except this show does n't hold my attention nearly as well as some of the others have . I 'm quite surprised by the other high reviews on here & I much preferred Mozart in the Jungle and especially Transparent -- I 'm hoping that 's the one that gets picked up -- it 's unique and interesting and left me wanting more !	-1
I really am stunned that this show seems to be getting the highest rating of all the new original pilots . It 's like all the other crime/cop dramas on TV already	-1
Bored me from the beginning . Will not match another crime show . It did n't keep me up , stopped watching it after 20 minutes .	-1
Like this pilot think it is great but a little slow , more like a law n order . I ca n't say I would watch it if they made it a series as there are sooooo many cop/court/detective dramas already . too original I like Bosch the character just want more gritty , dirty and grime . and maybe more action than just a fall down a hill . but for those who love and I mean love : ) cop shows that are more about the investigation , this is for you-enjoy .	-1
The episode barely kept my attention and I was not left with a feeling of wanting to see more . It wo n't be my first choice if I 'm looking for something to watch .	-1
The lead is a depressed bore and the other characters are stiff and cliche . The LA setting is done well but that is about it	-1
I read the books , so can `` identify '' but I do n't care for the actor chose for this part not `` scruffy '' enough for Bosch , at least the one I have an image of ... ... ...	-1
Another show extolling the virtues of addiction and self-abuse . I hate watching train wrecks and people hurting themselves and this show is nothing but that .	-1
A big Yawn . A standard police drama without an interesting hook . Titus Welliver is a wonderful actor that deserves stronger story lines .	-1
What a waste of talent . There 's lots of acting skill in the cast but they have n't been given a script worthy of their abilities . Drawn out underlit scenes of Bosch smoking obviously fill in for the times when the writers had nothing else to say . Just another police show about a cop with a questionable past . Yawn . Internal Affairs hates him ? Wow , never saw that before . Tough as nails lieutenant ? Central casting . Two stars for the actors but please find an original script and concept .	-1
Com'on people . We have all the CSI 's , USA shows , justified , list goes on and on . Show is predictable and is more at home on a cable television channel	-1
This was boring . I like Titus Welliver , but I 'm so bored with cop dramas . The production looked good . Spend your dollars on something else .	-1
BOSCH is a great series of book which huge TV potential , but this pilot does the character no justice.BOSCH is set in Los Angeles with wonderful and picturesque settings but in this pilot the actor 's overall demeanor and lack of personality quickly diminishes the entire show into a flashback detective caught in today 's world.The cliffhanger was actually the best part of the entire show but it was definitely too late.I was so excited to hear this pilot was being done but the result was less than apealing . overall great books poor pilot attempt .	-1
I am really confused as to why this show was rated so highly . I found it extremely BORING ! It was your cookie cutter crime drama , but with a lot more cigarette smoking . If you want to watch a good crime drama with Titus Welliver , you should watch The Good Wife on CBS instead .	-1
Felt like a fairly standard police procedural . I do n't think the concept was that revelatory or exciting . The execution was adequate . If they had an exciting new concept with an adequate execution I probably would have been more impressed ( alternately , their current concept with an amazing execution ) . It was n't ... bad . Just not that great . My response while watching it was one long , drawn-out meeehhh.I am not a big fan of this genre , so I may not be the most reliable reviewer .	-1
Really did not care for the show . The character was robotic and lacks emotions . Hope this show does not make it over the other shows .	-1
I 'm sure the series is counting on reeling in the viewer and hoping that the viewers read the book ( s ) , but the series was n't compelling . The actors did a decent job with what they were given , but the dialogue was n't believable , the plot was thin and predictable , and it was easy to look away . In fact , I found it hard to pay attention to something so monotonous . It 's & # 34 ; bad cop character hunts monstrous killer & # 34 ; for the umpteenth time and was n't done in a way that sets it apart from all the other series that follows that same format.I wanted to like this one . I truly did . It just does n't work thus far .	-1
If this show makes it out of all the other ones then there 's no hope for humanity , cop shows thrive on dragging on and being boring as always .	-1
He is not a good actor the show is ok but a bit boring to me , I am not crazy about this show .	-1
I turned this off after the opening scenes ... it did n't engage me . It might so well on network broadcasting ... maybe even cable but not up to Amazon standards .	-1
I found Bosch to be a slow paced show . I had to fight to get through the entire episode . This is a show that I could live without .	-1
Come on Amazon , ..Some of us do n't like HD , when are you going to make this available for those of us who would rather see it in SD , .At this time , we have no choice ! ! !	-1
I really wanted this to be good , Titus Welliver is a very fine actor who deserves a good show . However it was very unsatisfying . The mystery introduced is apparently one that would play out over several episodes , but at the end of this one , you would expect one major clue to be opened or resolved and that does n't really happen . I think the creators of the show decided they did n't want & # 34 ; done in one & # 34 ; mystery episodes but if you are going to string along the audience then each episode needs to be packed with interesting characters and sub plots . Not the case here .	-1
I 've tried several Amazon series , and each one has too much swearing . Right off the bat , this one has swearing.. literally in the first sentence ! That is such a turn off ! Every sentence after that is much the same . I finally could n't take it anymore . I 'm completely done with Amazon series . Disappointed .	-1
This show could use some better editing and less crime drama dialogue . You 've got a great cast that can pull it along , but the pace was incredibly slow and the dialogue was & # 34 ; cop show & # 34 ; predictable . The best thing about it was the amount shown in the court scenes . It seemed like the creators had a legal consultant , but forgot to do their ride-along . With the redundant flashbacks of the shooting , the unbelievable allowances that his supervisor was giving him after he was suspended and the fact that he did at least 3 things in the show that would have resulted in disciplinary action and demotion makes this show try too hard to have the stereotypical rebel cop . Can someone PLEASE tell crime shows that the audience does n't flashbacks ? You can say someone got shot -- we do n't need to see a replay of it .	-1
Here 's an idea , Amazon : if you 're going to ask me to watch something and review it , do n't lie to me about the rating . On your website and on my Amazon app on Roku , the show 's rating is listed as NR . Then , when I start to watch it , it actually shows it to be rated MA . Prior to popular belief , not everyone wants to watch MA shows . I 'm still of the belief that you can make quality programming without all the overt sexuality and profanity . Because for this reviewer , I do n't need or want that coming into my home and if it 's on there , then I wo n't watch the show no matter how well-acted , written or directed . So , here 's an idea - how about making a show that is NOT an MA rating . You know , not all of us think the use of the & # 34 ; f & # 34 ; word is quality writing . You sent me an email and asked for my review . Well , there you go ...	-1
I am repeating another review I read here : a bad table read . Really . Except they are n't sitting at a table , they are walking and sitting and smoking -- - all with crappy production values and bad dialogue . Watch one episode of The Closer or the Amazon Pilot Mozart in the Jungle and then watch this and you will know what I mean . Where the heck are all the 5 star reviews coming from ? Professional reviewers ? I say thumbs down ! ! !	-1
I REALLY wanted to like this movie . I like Elijah Wood and John Cusack , both , ... so for me , this was a pretty easy choice . Unfortunately , the story just does n't have the same quality as the actors that starred.The movie follows famed pianist , Tom Selznick ( Wood ) , in his attempt to make a come back following a 5 year hiatus . He had apparently attempted to play `` The Impossible Piece '' during his last live performance and hit the wrong notes causing him a breakdown and a newly acquired bout of stage fright . His wife , Emma ( Kerry Bish & eacute ; ) , is a world famous actress that has set her sights on fixing his problem . She sets up a symphony in honor of his recently deceased mentor , Patrick Godureaux ( Jack Taylor ) with Reisinger ( Don McManus ) acting as Conductor for the performance . As Tom begins to play he sees strange markings in his sheet music . After he begins reading , he is instructed to rush to his dressing room during a `` down moment '' in the piece , where he finds an ear piece which he then uses to communicate with Clem ( Cusack ) , the man behind the strange writing . Clem informs him that he MUST play `` The Impossible Piece '' at the end of the show to perfection or both he and his wife will die.Sounds interesting , right ? I sort of thought so too . Of course , I also took into consideration the level of acting that was involved in the picture . Unfortunately , they must have seen more than I did in the final product . The movie , while interesting at times , is just too ridiculous to be believable . *******SPOILERS*******Apparently , Clem is a locksmith . And having done work for the late Patrick Godureaux , he installed a lock inside his famous Grand Piano that only someone able to actually play , The Impossible Piece , could open . Apparently , there are only 2 people that have this ability : Godureaux and Tom Selznick . Since Godureaux is dead , that only leaves Tom . If this were the case , Clem ( as an apparent MASTER locksmith ( ? ) ) could either break into the late Godureaux 's estate and dismantle the piano for the key hidden within , or simple pick the lock that the key opens ? At the very least , could n't he just have gotten Selznick alone and had him play it that way ? Either way , the whole plot seemed WAY to far fetched for my taste . Besides , the contents of the safe are never revealed . ******* END SPOILERS*******Final Verdict : PASS ! You WILL be disappointed.If this review has helped you , please click the `` yes '' button below to let me know . Thanks .	-1
Whoever wrote this script needs to spend more time taking writing courses and/or reality courses.The entire plot oscillated between silly , dumb and making no sense . Why put an old skeleton key ( looks like it would only fit old doors or old cabinets ) in some really fakey mechanism inside an extremely expensive grand piano ? Why not just break into the cabinet ( or whatever the key fits ) directly without having to go through all this elaborate , low probability , highly unpredictable caper . Or , just break into the piano . Or , just have the pianist play it at some other time like at night . Or , build a small mechanical device to play four notes . The whole laser , cryptic notes , ear phones , accomplice , murders , ending tussle , and then falling 60 feet destroying a piano and his hair looked as perfect as the first scene - all of it was just , Huh ? Forgot , the movie is full of red laser pointer dots and beams . Are the several hundred people in the darkened hall blind ? What wasted potential !	-1
Elijah Wood plays a brilliant concert pianist with terrible stage-fright who is performing a comeback concert in memory of a dead mentor . Once he starts playing he is given something to really worry about -- a message from a sniper saying if he plays one wrong note he will be shot and if he stops the concert or signals for help his wife will be shot.It 's a neat set-up even if it 's basically Phone Booth in a concert hall and the movie is directed with so much energy and flair , and Elijah Wood is so persuasive as the twitchy pianist -- it 's possible you might not even notice how terrible the script is.In the film 's one clever bit Wood manages to text for help to his brother-in-law in the audience while playing a difficult piano piece without the sniper seeing what he 's doing . Unfortunately , it 's never set up that texting the brother-in-law might be helpful -- it would have been nice if he were an off duty cop or something like that -- and 5 minutes later the movie is back in exactly the same place it was before Wood sent the text.In fact that 's pretty much where the movie stays until late in the film when the only other twist comes and you find out what exactly is going on . Unfortunately , the minute the movie reveals villain John Cusack 's motives it becomes very clear that his carefully orchestrated plot is , in fact , ridiculously stupid , and that there must be at least a half dozen better ways to achieve what Cusack 's character wants that would be easier , safer , and much more likely to succeed.Still Grand Piano looks great and it 's directed with the bravado of 1970 's era Brian De Palma ( when his movies did n't suck ) . Elijah Wood does nicely with a change of pace non-psycho role . John Cusack , on the other hand , is stuck playing the man with the idiotic plan and does n't manage to do much with his poorly written character or terrible dialogue.Fans of stylish thrillers who do n't care about storytelling will likely eat this up . Everyone else should keep their expectations low .	-1
Tom ( Elijah Wood ) is married to movie star Emma ( Kerry Bish & eacute ; ) . They are the annoying type of people who walk around with a phone in their ear . In Florida it is almost legal to kill them . He & # 34 ; choked & # 34 ; the last time he played the piano ... five years ago . He flies to Chicago ( from London ? ) changes in a limo on the way to the concert hall , goes on stage with an orchestra he has n't played or practiced with in five years and is afraid of choking . Seriously ? I ca n't brush my teeth right after a good jet lag.Now as he starts to play , he gets the message that if he misses a note , he dies ... or Emma dies . Neither one was likeable and this was the scenario I was hoping for . So after 20 minutes , I kept wondering , & # 34 ; Is this going to be the whole movie ? & # 34 ; 40 minutes go by and this is still the freaking film . At 55 minutes we get a clue as to why this was going on . I really did n't care at this point , I just wanted to see Tom and Emma die a horrible death for talking on their cell phones all the time.How long is John Cusack on the screen ? Do n't ask.I do n't understand the rave reviews . It does n't keep you on the edge of your seat . A boring & # 34 ; thriller. & # 34 ;	-1
It is not funny in the least . No real imagination leads to no real laughs . Each episode is the same ... grownup disregards boy , boy gets his feelings hurt , grownup redeems themselves . Very formulaic . Hollywood at it 's worst .	-1
First off Jackie Christie is such a fake and this season she has found her some minions to follow her and a couple of them must have a little bit of hood rat in them . I watched 2 shows and decided that this season is a waste of time so I wo n't be renting any more . Maybe next season you will bring back some of the original cast and it will be worth watching . Please get rid of Jackie .	-1
That is really how bad the show is . It 's so bad that I 'm speechless . I only watch this show when I have nothing else better to do . & # 34 ; BLAH & # 34 ;	-1
I like the show , but it moves too slowly . There are like 3 episodes and they call it a season . Then I have to wait a year to find out what 's next . Pretty frustrating . I will wait until the entire series is over and then watch them all in the same day . Not sure what the trouble is , but there should 8 - 9 episodes a year . Also the plot is drifting . Fighting and acting scenes very good .	-1
What the hell ? This video was an acrobat show . I wanted to see PINK from the start of her career when all the dance hits made her . This new stuff sucks . If you 're into the new PINK ... this is right up your alley if you have an alley ? If you prefer the older more hip hop version of her you can forget it . What she does sing from the good ole ' days is butchered to the new PINK style . She could have at least mixed up a little old with the new . For me this was lame . She 's long ago forgotten what music really made her famous . So sad . You can tell she owns stock in SPANKS . LOL	-1
I was hopeful this would be `` a little gem '' like one review stated ... ..even a gem of a B horror movie.Well in my opinion , this `` little gem '' stunk ! Very poor story development ... ..lack luster acting all around ... anda few scattered scares ... .but by that time who cares ? Very poorly done all around ... ..not even one of thosereally bad horror movies ... .that are SO bad they are kinda fun . Nope ... .this one has no redeeming qualities.I love a good haunted house movie ... ..this one fell super short in my opinion .	-1
I am HAUNTed by the fact that I just spent $ 7.99 to rent this movie ! ! ! ! Scroll away from the purchase page as fast as you can and DO NOT think twice about it ! ! ! ! If Amazon put this movie on a stream free give away I would still NOT recommend it , and would suggest that you flee from it because I would NOT want to be responsible for the curse of sorrow that you watching this movie would bring you ! ! ! ! Nuff said ! ! ! !	-1
This is a feable attempt at a play on words with the title . It says that it is a sneak peak before it goes to the movies but it is never going to make it to the movies . I do not recommend this movie unless you are a cheese ball .	-1
I 'm ticked off big time ! ! ! ! A friend of mine said I needed to watch the comedy & # 34 ; The fart of the seal & # 34 ; and everybody knows that farts are funny , so I went to the video store and asked for & # 34 ; The fart of the seal & # 34 ; and they handed me this movie , and when I watched it I did not see even one farting seal ! ! ! ! This is the last time I take movie suggestions from that friend ! ! ! ! Geezzow ! ! ! !	-1
In my review of season one I had written that I felt this was an odd interpretation of the Thomas Harris characters . Season two though has taken it to an all new level . This supposedly was a prequel to events in the book and movie Red Dragon . Yet in this season they are killing off characters that play pivotal roles in both RD and SOTL . So how exactly does that work ? What the writers have done to the Will Graham character here makes the events that occur in Red Dragon impossible . A case of `` you can not get there from here '' . As a stand alone series this can be interesting . Any link to the stories of the author Thomas Harris have been tossed to the wayside .	-1
The pace ... omg ... slow , slow , slow , glacially slow ... soporific . And the images ... a naked woman in a bed of black satin sheets ... one drop of blood ? Please -- every lame vampire book on the market has that one on the cover . Lots of talk about sex and death and the psyche . Most of which is silly and lame . Pretentious . Dull . Not worth a penny . I hope all of the characters find a creative way to eat each other until all of them are dead .	-1
This review is for the Season 6 Episode 5 of the show for Amazon Instant Video , not just for the show . I enjoy the show very much ; however , the service from Amazon Instant Video is very slow . The episode is already out on iTunes ... .I am thinking of canceling the TV pass and signing up for it on iTunes since they have the same thing . It is sort of odd that Amazon is n't more competitive with their service considering their competition . I know you can also watch it for free on the Logo site but for some I can not get it to pay on my puter right now .	-1
The creators of this show are certainly not trying to reel in viewers with the first show . It is slow moving and dull . This show wo n't get another season , I can promise you .	-1
Low budget not worth the time to watch . Wasted the money to buy it . We did n't even finish pilot show	-1
This just is not my cup of tea . It 's easy to see what will be coming down the road . The actors are good , ( I love Jason Momomia ) but they just ca n't lift the script out of the mundane .	-1
I like the main actor . After watching Stargate : Atlantis , I went looking for something else he was in . There is not a single likable character . I was very disappointed .	-1
At first I thought it would be a mad max type of movie but it was n't at all interesting or my type .	-1
Red Road is confusing to watch from the start . The actors just seem uncomfortable in their parts which makes you want to watch something else .	-1
The opening to & # 34 ; Adult World & # 34 ; is enough to let you know what you 're in for as you witness Amy attempt to commit suicide by sticking her head in the oven and putting a plastic bag over her head . After getting a job at Adult World , Amy 's boss is a very down to earth guy named Alex ( Evan Peters ) who may work at an adult video store , but has no issue with that whatsoever and he does n't let that affect his other interests . It 's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia ( Armando Riesco ) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack . Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet . She makes childish mistakes , but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child . She 's irritating , has a nerve-grating voice , is naive , and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her . Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment , but the most interesting character is Rubia . The character really does n't do much other than smoke pot , ride a stolen bicycle , and give other women makeovers , but Rubia never pretends to be anything that she is n't . Amy asks Rubia in one scene if she has ever felt invisible . Rubia 's face distorts as she says , & # 34 ; Not really. & # 34 ; It 's as if Rubia has all the attention she 's ever wanted while Amy continues to search for the big break she 's always craved.If you can persevere through Amy 's temper tantrums and John Cusack acting like he has no interest in being in & # 34 ; Adult World , & # 34 ; then there actually is something really positive and inspirational lying under layers within the film . Like & # 34 ; Inside Llewyn Davis , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Adult World & # 34 ; seems to speak to you if you 've ever felt like a struggling artist . Along the way , Amy learns that it 's not just about making a name for yourself , getting rich , or becoming famous . You ca n't make a carbon copy of the path your idol took or follow in anyone else 's footsteps . Sometimes you have to take your own path and create your art just for you. & # 34 ; Adult World & # 34 ; has this really exceptional message wrapped up in this unbelievably obnoxious package that almost makes the entire experience unbearable . It 's like a really disgusting bag of garbage filled with rotting produce and decomposing meats ; the type of garbage that creates that dirty , brown trash juice you always find bleeding out of dumpsters . Yet in the middle of that bag is something worthwhile like a forgotten treasure map or one of your favorite comic books magically still in mint condition . & # 34 ; Adult World & # 34 ; may have meaning , but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered , prepubescent , overdramatic whimpering just to get to it .	-1
Sadly , this movie disappointed . I was looking forward to the quirky girl who finds herself or love or something else interesting . Instead , we 're treated to a histrionic college-age diva who lacks almost any redeeming qualities . Ostensibly , she wants to be a poet , and haunts the guy ( John Cusack ) who she idolizes . He lets her into his world , only to try to teach her a few lessons . However , our oblivious heroine fails to catch on until the very end , and even then , she remains barely likable . Of course there are the supporting cast of the usual suspects : the boy who paints only her , the loving couple that owns the adult book store , as well as the usual stereotypes . The premise had a long way to go , but it stayed too shallow , never delving into the young lady 's lack of worldly experience , how that could have been remedied , and how she could have found meaning in her life that might have translated into worthy writing of poetry or another form . John Cusack played his character perfectly , and that was what keep me watching . Otherwise , it was simply the movie that could n't end soon enough . Oh , well .	-1
Total waste of time and money . Did n't laugh ONCE ! Story was TERRIBLE . Acting was good- it was a waste of the actor 's talent .	-1
Giving this movie three stars would be to generous , ugh ! This movie reminded me of `` Booty Call '' back in the day a up grade from that movie . Kevin Hart , you could have done better the movie with Ice cube `` Ride alone '' was a pretty good movie . This movie was garbage it should go straight to netflix .	-1
**1/2So what do we have here ? Nothing but another unnecessary remake of an & # 8216 ; 80s film . This time it & # 8217 ; s & # 8220 ; About Last Night , & # 8221 ; the romantic drama starring Demi Moore and Rob Lowe , which was itself based on the highly acclaimed play by David Mamet , provocatively entitled & # 8220 ; Sexual Perversity in Chicago. & # 8221 ; In this version , it & # 8217 ; s Joy Brand and Michael Ealy who play the young urban couple who meet , fall in love , move in together , then begin to have doubts about the efficacy and durability of their relationship.Brand and Ealy are appealing and attractive performers , and both have done fine work on TV , Brand in & # 8220 ; Parenthood & # 8221 ; and Ealy in & # 8220 ; Almost Human. & # 8221 ; But here they have been let down by screenwriter Leslye Headland , who proves herself incapable of getting past all the timeworn tropes and cliches that have become so much a part of the romantic comedy genre . The movie becomes just another men-are-from-Mars/women-are-from-Venus-type scenario , filled with girl-talk and guy-talk and all the predictable sturm und drang soul-baring and commitment issues ( mainly on the part of the man , of course ) that such narratives are prone to . Too often the things pulling the couple apart feel scripted and manufactured rather than organic and real . Under the slick but lackluster direction of Steve Pink , everyone just seems to be going through the motions , without any real passion or conviction.The movie also comes replete with the requisite smart-aleck , comic-relief couple ( well-played by Kevin Hart and Regina Hall ) to serve as a foil for the one on center-stage . Yet , even the humor tends to aim low when it should be aiming high.I like the way the story hits the re-set button in the final scene , but by then it & # 8217 ; s a case of too little too late and we & # 8217 ; ve already moved onto the next movie .	-1
In That awkward moment , three best friends find themselves at that confusing moment in every dating relationship when you have to decide `` So ... where is this going ? `` First I must say that this is definitely a chick flick and not that I am against that but this is definitely orientated towards a female audience more than a male audience . There are some funny moments that did make me laugh but unfortunately there was not enough of those . Secondly , the three male leads acted like a bunch of women at times and more in a way that catered to that female audience that I am talking about.There were some moments of cuteness but the movie was very predictable in its ending as it seems a lot of movies in the genre seem to be these days . Whatever happened to the `` Chasing Amy '' type movies that do n't always have that clich & eacute ; ending . Unfortunately not here.My wife definitely liked better than me but even still she says it is a 3 star movie at best . I personally give this some thing in between at 2.5 stars .	-1
Three guys vow to stay single . Jason ( Zac Efron ) is a NYC book cover designer who plays the field . He does n't realize he is dating a woman until after they break up with him . Daniel ( Miles Teller ) works with Jason and has a friends with benefits relationship with Chelsea ( Mackenzie Davis ) . Guess how that works out ... hint it 's a chick flick . Mike ( Michael B. Jordan ) is a doctor whose wife ( Jessica Lucas ) wants a divorce and is cheating on him with a lawyer . Jason meets Ellie ( Imogen Poots ) who is everything he wants in a woman as this throws a wrench into the & # 34 ; everybody stay single and play the field like we 're in college & # 34 ; vow.This is a chick flick poorly disguised as a guy 's film . We know it is a chick flick because it is overrated due to Zac Efron being in it . It tosses some crude humor at us and some better barbs about relationships , but frankly it is the same old Hollywood schtick that brings nothing new to the table . Having said that , the actors did a fine job in their roles made unconvincing by a trite script.Will do as a chick flick rental , although I thought & # 34 ; The Other Woman & # 34 ; was a funnier chick flick.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex . No nudity . Efron nearly nude .	-1
January is always the worst month of the year for an avid moviegoer like thornhill . The studios are too busy promoting the wide releases of their Oscar hopefuls to concentrate on new films they have any hope for . As a result , January is a dumping ground for bad films they ca n't wait to write off . But Big Hollywood still hopes they can bilk an unsuspecting public out of a few million dollars before the release ends up in streaming and free cable hell.Because & # 34 ; That Awkward Moment & # 34 ; is a quote-unquote romantic comedy and it is being released two weeks before Valentine 's Day , I held out some hope for it . That , and the fact Zac Efron seems to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance since leaving rehab & # 8211 ; he is in a lot films & # 8211 ; seemed to indicate the film might be better.But & # 34 ; That Awkward Moment & # 34 ; is full of , well , awkward moments that were funny the first five times we saw the same jokes in other films and television shows . Now , one hundred times later , the jokes are boring and routine . These jokes are now so familiar they have been relegated to bad television sitcoms.Zac Efron and Miles Teller play Jason and Daniel , co-workers and best friends , who meet regularly with Mikey ( Michael P. Jordan , & # 34 ; Fruitvale Station & # 34 ; ) , a doctor who discovers his wife is cheating on him - to discuss girls , dating and their conquests . They talk about every part of their sexual conquests , their penises , their bodily functions , etc . They talk a lot about things I find it hard to believe three straight guys pursuing relationships with females would talk about.Eventually , they make a pact to stay single as long as Mikey is single . Given the predictability of THIS quote-unquote romantic comedy , you already know what that means ; one or more of the guys will immediately fall in love with a girl and try to hide it from the others . Strangely , the filmmakers views these relationships as an excuse for the three guys to get together and talk more . The story does n't really shift to the new male-female relationships . Essentially , this is a quote-unquote romantic comedy about three guys.That might work , if the film were in better creative hands . Written and directed by Tom Gormicon , whose only other credit is & # 34 ; Movie 43 & # 34 ; & # 8211 ; the worst film I have ever seen & # 8211 ; nothing in & # 34 ; That Awkward Moment & # 34 ; is original or seems remotely real or true . That 's too bad because you get the sense the filmmakers are trying for so much more . Which makes & # 34 ; Moment & # 34 ; an even bigger disappointment.And it 's too bad for Zac Efron who is a really handsome , really terrible actor & # 8211 ; he has the looks of a matinee idol but he just ca n't act . When he works with more talented directors , he does a better job . But in & # 34 ; Moment & # 34 ; , his character just seems like a jerk , the whole time , and never really changes.Miles Teller is basically the comic relief and Michael P. Jordan plays the 'real ' member of the trio . He is going through a real-life situation . But they do n't , or ca n't , overcome the clich & eacute ; d story , bad direction and stilted acting of the lead.Imogen Poots plays Ellie , the object of Jason 's affections . She must be the next & # 34 ; It & # 34 ; girl , because she is in a lot of movies coming out this year . She does n't earn that title with this performance . She is good , OK , acceptable , but because she has to play against Efron , her performance fails to register. & # 34 ; That Awkward Moment & # 34 ; is bad . And it will surely end up on a lot of & # 34 ; Worst of 2014 & # 34 ; lists .	-1
This is a story done semi-documentary style about a group of amateur authors who read their writings to the group and bounce off ideas . Their writings overtly and boringly reflect their own personal life . The bulk of the movie being consumed by interviews.Hannah Rinaldi ( Kaley Cuoco aka Penny ) the stereotyped dumb blond sends ripples through the group when she secures a book deal.The film attempts to be a clever quirky indie , but falls short of being either . I found the interview scenes boring and pretentious . It was like a constant narration . Perhaps the funniest part was the writing of Colette Mooney ( Teri Polo ) who was terribly attempting to write a Russian novel , yet everyone gave her encouragement . And BTW the heroine of her tale was suddenly having an affair with a young peasant man.For hard core indie fans . A subtle comedy , but not a great one.Parental Guide : No f-bombs , sex , or nudity .	-1
I 'm so glade that I did n't spend 4 bucks on this movie I caught it on Netflix . I was so board to the point where I fell asleep if your expecting gore keep moving , if you 're expecting zombie action keep moving , if you 're expecting a good movie period keep moving . Folks please do not waste your money this movie is n't nearly worth it trust me . If I could give no stars it would n't show !	-1
During the first zombie outbreak that we do n't get to see , over 100 million people died . A drug was found to control the disease . There is a catch . The drug must be injected every 36 hours or the person reverts . There is a short supply of the drug as it is derived from the spinal column of dead zombies . Kate ( Emily Hampshire ) is a doctor who treats & # 34 ; the Returned & # 34 ; and has a boyfriend Alex ( Kris Holden-Ried ) who is a music teacher and one of them.Kate buys treatments under the table . She has to battle against the societal prejudice against & # 34 ; zombies & # 34 ; which has become a politically incorrect word . It takes about 40 minutes to develop the plot and character.The film has parallels to homophobia and various prejudices , after all who wants their sister to marry a zombie ? There are anti-return groups and killings.The main problem is when the movie picks up it still moves slow . I kept waiting for something to catch and hold my interest . The ending was a yawn in spite of the attempt at being a dramatic twist . Not exactly a zombie film.Parental Guide : F-bomb . No sex or nudity	-1
It was a bit too slow and dull-witted for me . I actually fell asleep while watching ... .. not usual for me .	-1
life already has this pace this feeling of ennui and helplessness . if you would like to increase your sense of ineptitude and undesirability , watch this film .	-1
Okay ... some nice pictures , some nice information , but for the most part this is really a series for children or the cosmically deficient . Totally not impressed .	-1
I 'll try to be succinct : 1 . This is n't as good as the original , regardless of the cgi or special effects , which , btw , are cheesy and not so good - especially the graphic of Saturn ( with a missing lower half of the orb ) and especially the godawful spaceship . As bad as the original spaceship was , it is better than this one.2 . Do we need 7 minutes of credits from the 'producer ' , 'executive producer ' , 'co-executive producer ' , 'executive co-executive associate producer ' , etc . etc. ? I 'm surprised the FOX logo is n't placed in the lower right of the screen for the entire episode - thank god it is n't . 3 . I 'll wait for the complete series to come on DVD and then borrow it from the library , for free .	-1
Please note , I have now watched all the new episodes by now and every time I have flat out fallen asleep or just turn the TVS off . The original COSMOS literally changed my life forever . This new version makes me literally snore on the couch in about 9 minutes . How could they of botched this entire series so badly ? There is a great responsibility to produce this program to be amazing and its just lame . Dr. Tyson is a fun scientist but he does n't really work in this program . He seems nervous and speaks with a tone that makes you feel like your at a kindergarten story time reading . At times he looks like he is thinking to himself , `` ... I know this is going to suck '' or `` ... I do n't get why we are doing this ? '' ... He seems uncomfortable on camera and I do n't think that is because he is uncomfortable in front of a camera . I think its because he is realizing that the production and direction Fox is taking creating with him as the host ... is seemingly ... sucking ? ! Its lacking that `` pocket '' and synergy that Sagan and his production created . With 20 years advancement in special effects and scientific knowledge ... FOX ca n't make a space documentary that is mind blowing ? Why ? ... . This is COSMOS ! ? How could that be allowed to happen ? Why are there so many boring , cheap cartoons ! They suck ! Is this because they wanted to save money on actors and effects so they went to cheap cartoon technology to get the required content for a show ? The cartoons are clearly a hint that something went wrong at the production of this show.The content also lacks cohesion . It bounces around and makes really obvious and sophomoric points , or completely fails to make a point altogether . The actual science and sense of awe we should be getting from this show is lighter then any other similar cosmology documentary . It left me saying over and over again , `` ... I already knew that . Ive known that since I was 12 years old '' . The point that the milky way galaxy is really , really big and that stars are far , far away ... is a point I do n't need to be patronized with for an hour and $ 2 . Tell me something that is awe inspiring ? Who wrote this script ? The script and topics they choose are just completely uninspired , back room napkin , after thoughts.One episode which was the worst , was almost entirely in the lame cartoon format and it went on and on about the guy that discovered that Lead in regular gasoline was polluting our environment . This story was told through a cheap `` Johnny Quest '' style cartoon for an hour and at the end of all this , there was no connection or point to cosmology that I could readily see . The only episode that was inspiring and echoed the original series in beauty and script was `` Sisters of the Sun '' where they talked about stars . But here again , compared to other similar programs discussing similar topics , this was like watching the opening premise that stars are really , really hot and really , really big and really , really , far , far away over and over again . The science has ZERO depth . The script is either written for morons or was written by morons ? Why would Tyson sign off on this ? Its a HUGE disappointment for COSMOS fans . Tyson is impedent as the host , the script has no cohesion , the episodes are childish , they rip you off with boring cartoon story telling to save a buck on production costs , it ends and you feel like you just ate a rice cake . It is a completely dry , uninspiring waste of time , with no flavor ... its lame and a shame , Carl Sagan deserves better .	-1
Boring , poor editing , not very good investigative techniques.I can see why I never heard of the show , not worth the time .	-1
I really tried hard to watch this show , but got bored with it really quickly . I like to be on the edge of my seat when watching ghost stories or shows , but this one put me to sleep and no excitement .	-1
Just dis n't have anything new to offer other than the fact that the main character is a & # 34 ; cutter & # 34 ; which made her just a bit more interesting . Ireally like The lead actress .	-1
Although showing excellent production values and acting , I found this series disappointing . It seems to be edging away from the detective thriller mode into the horror-macabre mode , with scenes added for the benefit of masochistic viewers who want to experience fear and revulsion .	-1
Oh my goodness , this show is bad . I thought maybe because chloe sevigny was in it , it might be good . It 's all bad detective cliche with NOTHING redeeming , except maybe good fodder for satire . So , so very bad . Why , with shows like Hannibal and true detective , do people still make shows this bad ? I do n't get it .	-1
The first season was great ... this one is dominated by tired , boring dialog in Russian with subtitles . The main , interesting characters are ignored as the writers go on and on about stupid , boring plots ... while the original ideas for this great show get lost.Yuck . Cancel my season pass ... . I 'm done .	-1
This is a terrible movie after watching it I wished I had not wasted the time .	-1
I was half hoping for something substantial to develop , but sadly thirty minutes in i almost could predict what the actors were going to do and say.I just found myself yawning and getting up to do other things at home wash dishes laundry etc.I was also hoping for less than obvious dialog and acting but sadly i was left wondering why the heck did i waste my money on this film.Put aside the special effects and you have pretty much nothing .. i tried to sit through the entire film and felt what 's the point .	-1
The disaster of the city of Pompeii took place in the year 79 AD and has really become more of a tragic legend than fact . Although historians are aware of the time frame in which the volcano , Mount Vesuvius , erupted & # 8211 ; along with having some names of people that died in the catastrophe & # 8211 ; that & # 8217 ; s really all they know . With that in mind , the imagination and fictitious accounts make up the storyline for the period adventure flick , Pompeii.Paul W. S. Anderson ( Resident Evil , Mortal Kombat ) directs the epic , Pompeii & # 8211 ; starring Kit Harington as Milo . As a young boy , Milo watched as the Romans slaughtered his people ( and parents ) , led by a dastardly soldier , Corvus ( Kiefter Sutherland ) . Although Milo survived the attack , he was captured and thrown into slavery , eventually becoming a lethal gladiator . In fact , he & # 8217 ; s so lethal that his master , Graecus ( Joe Pingue ) , decides to move him to a grander stage in the city of Pompeii.On the way to Pompeii , the lives of Milo and a wealthy merchant & # 8217 ; s daughter , Cassia ( Emily Browning ) , become intertwined . Shortly thereafter , Milo learns he must fight Pompeii & # 8217 ; s gladiator champion , Atticus ( Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ) & # 8211 ; but prior to their showdown , the two men form a surprising and unsuspecting friendship . At the same time , the man that killed Milo & # 8217 ; s family , Corvus , comes to town and is now a well-respected ( and feared ) Roman senator.Corvus has been looking for Cassia ( whom he desperately wants to marry ) and quickly notices the growing bond that has formed between Cassia and Milo . In an effort to dispose of Milo , Corvus puts both Atticus and Milo in the Pompeii coliseum for the fight of their lives & # 8211 ; a fight in which they are sure to lose their lives . However , without any warning , a volcano outside the city erupts thrusting everyone into a panic as the sky rains with fire and ash.For the fans of the popular film , Gladiator , the plot of Pompeii will appear to be extremely familiar . Both feature a storyline that is driven by revenge after the death of the main character & # 8217 ; s family . But , Pompeii is certainly no Gladiator and the fact that both films are being used in the same sentence is borderline outrageous . Still , it & # 8217 ; s hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies & # 8211 ; prompting Pompeii to easily be labeled as a dreaded Gladiator & # 8220 ; knockoff. & # 8221 ; Kit Harington , who is most recognizable from his starring role in the popular HBO drama , Game of Thrones , plays a character that we & # 8217 ; ve seen countless times in the past & # 8211 ; and again is much like the lead character in Gladiator ( although Harington is a far cry from the masterful Russell Crowe ) . Milo is cold as ice on the outside , but clearly filled with righteous emotions on the inside . He & # 8217 ; s been driven by revenge his whole life , but once he lays his eyes on the beautiful & # 8220 ; princess , & # 8221 ; suddenly his heart melts and he has new meaning to live.If you happen to be a fan of Jon Snow ( Harington & # 8217 ; s Game of Thrones character ) , then you should find just as much enjoyment in the Milo character . Harington literally looks like he walked of the set of Game of Thrones and jumped right into Pompeii . In fact , the two characters are so similar that it will be almost impossible to tell them apart . Unfortunately , it & # 8217 ; s difficult to determine whether or not that & # 8217 ; s a good thing or a bad thing . Really , the only bothersome part of Harington & # 8217 ; s character in Pompeii is that it & # 8217 ; s filled with far too many holes since viewers will have no idea what happened to the character from childhood to adulthood & # 8211 ; although one could assume he was constantly in chains.The main character depth issue , which plagues many films that have previously attempted to do too much in too little time & # 8211 ; evident in films like John Carter and Prince of Persia , also hampers Pompeii . Several lead characters , like Emily Browning & # 8217 ; s Cassia or Kiefer Sutherland & # 8217 ; s Corvus , are nothing more than randomly in the wrong place at the wrong time & # 8211 ; sort of like anyone that was aboard the Titanic . Sadly , the ambitions of these two vague , aloof characters are never fully realized , and are poorly reduced to taking part in an under whelming love triangle.Storyline aside , the CGI is also an issue that takes away from the film . For roughly the first half of the film , the actors are mostly able to avoid the dreaded green screen . However , as the volcano begins to erupt and the coliseum fighting ensues , the CGI becomes unbearably frequent & # 8211 ; and is about as believable as the CGI used in Paul W. S. Anderson & # 8217 ; s Resident Evil films . If you & # 8217 ; ve sat through other disaster flicks , like 2012 or Armageddon , then Pompeii will give off a similar feeling of disappointment with the over abuse of computer graphics.Overall , Pompeii is a film that will appeal more to Game of Thrones lovers and moviegoers that enjoy gladiator tales . The story is far from unique , but that doesn & # 8217 ; t stop it from being a semi-entertaining adventure flick . It progresses at an intense pace and features plenty of action ( even though most of it is noticeably fake ) . Everlasting love is apparently the theme of the story , but by the time the credits roll , I suspect most viewers will feel as though they wasted their time watching a film that is filled with nothing more than death , disappointment , and shattered expectations . $ 100 million is far too much to spend of the movie of this nature and even though it is an average & # 8220 ; popcorn & # 8221 ; film , the disappointing finale will leave the majority of viewers uttering , & # 8220 ; that & # 8217 ; s it ? & # 8221 ; GRADE : C-FNDNreview.com	-1
I 'm not sure how any of these actors signed on to the project with the script they were given to read . The whole plot was a failed attempt at plagarizing every other & # 34 ; forbidden love & # 34 ; scenario ever seen in movies . The destruction was on par with the movie 2012 , and really , it was the destruction you rooted for in the end . Oh , and when you get to the part about the chariot racing down the street , ignore the little things like how a 4 horse chariot could miraculously find a completely empty , near-debris-free road , or how it could outrace an earthquake , or even how it could make such a sharp turn that even most cars would flip on their sides to make . Ya ... good script there ... .Like I mentioned in the title line , just mute the sound , turns the caps off , and enjoy the C.G.I . In the end I rooted for the volcano ... and somehow I just do n't think that was the feeling I should have been asked to feel . The movie did nothing to honor any of those lost to such a horrific death .	-1
Dialogue & acting - dialogue is changed from 1st century Italian into 18th century old English by Hollywood . A common dialogue found in many of their period movies no matter what century or country . Acting was daytime soap TV level.Characters - noncreative , plug and play characters e.g . gladiators ( one black ) , soon to become friends with main character ( done before ) ; his counterpart sees his parents die at Roman hands and is now old enough for revenge ( done before ) ; evil Romans acting badly ; aristocratic pretty daughter ( still has 21st century make up , eye liner , etc . ) falls for gladiator ( of course ) .Action scenes - good gladiators defeat dozens of Romans as brunch ( I was waiting for one hand tied behind the back and blindfolded but the writers copped out ) . Not realistic.CGI - flashes of CGI volcano every 5 to 10 minutes to remind us of what the movie is about . Familiar scenes of water rushing over the city - already used in many tsunami movies . Looked like the same wave used in several recent Indian Ocean tsunami films , but not as well done as say in `` The Impossible '' . Comical volcano Roman Candle fireworks fireballs .	-1
It 's interesting to think about life in POMPEII on the fateful day Mount Vesuvius errupted and ended life in the thriving city . The movie POMPEII caught my attention and I was imagining a somewhat historical tale of love and life in the time of disaster.It seemed like the filmmakers took the idea of a volcano errupting and worked a fantastical tale around it that is as ordinary as they come . Gladiator slave falls in love with rich beautiful young lady who is pursued by an evil politician . There is so much to tell about POMPEII and the lives of ordinary citizens and the frantic desperate moments when they realized they were doomed.Buffed and chisled Kit Harrington loses his family in Britain and ends up in Pompeii as a slave who is fighting gladiators in the arena . He 's again Jon Snow from GAME OF THRONES only in a different setting and time period . He does his best and lovely Carrie-Ann Moss always is worth watching . Maybe more of their love story in a different setting would have been more exciting.Kiefer Sutherland is the evil Roman Senator and Sutherland plays his character with some sort of stilted Briish accent . Why do characters set in ancient Roman times always speak with British accents ? It seems like POMPEII has a sprinkling of the STARZ series SPARTACUS with its gladiator theme . The main action begins in the last part of the film as Mount Vesuvius finally errupts . Here is where the real story should be given more attention as terrified and desperate people are trying to escape while others are resigned to their fates.I watched the bonus feature about the volcano and the filmmakers say they followed the writings of Pliny the Younger who was a witness to the disaster . They said they followed Pliny 's description of the erruption and the effects on the Bay of Naples . Imagine people trying to flee by ship on the unforgiving waters . Here would be a fascinating story and it is addressed to some degree . Some of the visual effects are great . Others look fake.An attempt was made to tell an interesting story in the time of disaster but the whole film falls apart .	-1
Okay . It 's a new year so I can have a new WSF ( Worst So Far ) , although I 'm sure there will be even worse as the year goes on . As a rule , I find most clich & eacute ; d situations to be diverting , but not the groaners in this thing . I 'm sure the gales of laughter that met the finale were NOT what the director had in mind ! ( To be fair , sometimes a screening audience IS a tough sell . ) Director Paul W.S . Anderson ( & # 34 ; The Three Musketeers & # 34 ; ) specializes in Computer Generated Imaging , so this actioner contains no surprises , but this bloodbath piled cruelty upon cruelty : lashings , bashings , smashings and slashings , so I kept my eyes covered and my yawns smothered much of the time . How many ways can they draw blood or cause mental anguish ? ( One couple actually brought a toddler . Okay , no profanity , so no harm ... .. ) These folks have had better roles , but they give it their best : * Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ( & # 34 ; Thor : The Dark World & # 34 ; ) has our sympathy as the gladiator promised his freedom if he wins his last fight . Yeah ... right ... * Kit Harington ( & # 34 ; Game of Thrones & # 34 ; ) is our hero , a Celt with uncommon fighting skills , enslaved by Roman soldiers since childhood . Of course it 's love at first sight when our heroine makes her entrance . * Emily Browning ( & # 34 ; Sucker Punch & # 34 ; ) is that puffy-lipped heroine . She is betrothed ( unwillingly ) to a Roman senator by her less-than-courageous father . * Jared Harris ( & # 34 ; Mad Men & # 34 ; ) is that father , who apparently backed the wrong politician and now has to make amends to the current powers that be . * Carrie-Anne Moss ( & # 34 ; Vegas & # 34 ; ) is his wife . At least she can see the political scene clearly , although there is very little she can do about it . * Kiefer Sutherland ( Lots of TV ) is the dastardly senator from Rome who lusts after our heroine and wants to invest in real estate in our fair city . ( Pompeii was considered a resort town by the Romans . ) No fight is worth watching unless there are insurmountable odds ( which of course our hero surmounts ) and lots of blood . And we only HEAR him break that horse 's neck ... .I do n't remember archaeologists mentioning a tsunami , do you ? I thought it was pyroclastic ( searing ) blasts and ash-fall from Mount Vesuvius that killed the good folks in Pompeii . This morning I contacted someone who toured Pompeii and never heard a word about a tsunami . By the way , the plaster casts we associate with Pompeii were created when archaeologists injected a substance into the hollows in the solidified ash which were left after corpses decomposed.Expect lots of swordplay , spear thrusts , fist fights , earthquakes , a volcanic eruption , and a tsunami . Only one chaste little kiss though , and no sweaty bodies ( PG-13 ) . Whew !	-1
I am a great fan of movies that deal with historical happenings , even if much liberty is taken with the films . I am also an Historicalnut when it come to Roman History . This movie is awfull ... YES AWFULL ! ! The history is shoddy , the cast lousy , and the actingterrible . Just another Roman bashing movie . For one thing , the population ( free men ) were all Roman Citizens . This film seemedto say they were not . And any time anybody makes a film about Rome ( from Hollyweird ) the Romans are all evil and contributednothing to Western Civilization . The US constitution is in large part based in the Roman Republics constitution , even the architecturein DC is primarily Roman or styled after Roman buildings . How about Roman Law , the basis of European and US law . There aremany things I could mention but I should continue about this movie . The story was STUPID , STUPID , STUPID ! ! ! I only gave thismess 2 stars ( I was being generous ! ) because of the fine special effects , the reasonably accurate sets and the volcano eruptions.I will probably keep the DVD only because of the effects . I did get this from Amazon . I also got the 1984 version of THE LASTDAYS OF POMPEII and will review it later when I finish . Allready it seems much better , at least in story . So if you like excellentspecial effects and like to watch a Roman city leveled , then I would reluctantly rent or buy the movie . But you better by someclothespins for your nose . Or just scan ahead to the good parts . enjoy !	-1
Cheese , cheese , cheese , and more cheese than you ever imagined was possible in a short few hours of cheese . Cheese .	-1
It was n't all that long ago or at least it feels that way , that Hollywood suddenly remembered the sword and sandal films of the sixties and began making them all over again . There were some great films made too , in particular GLADIATOR and TROY . Then the genre died out again or found itself taken over by ridiculously low budgeted reproductions of those popular films . It went back to the shelf . Now director Paul W.S . Anderson tries to bring it to life again with POMPEII . Unfortunately the film falls somewhere between those two types of films , the good and the bad.The story revolves around Milo who as a child watches as his parents and entire tribe of Celt horsemen are slaughtered by the Romans led by General Corvus ( Keifer Sutherland ) and his right hand man Proculus . Pretending to be dead , young Milo climbs from under the bodies of those who were slaughtered only to later be captured and placed into slavery.Years go by and Milo ( Kit Harington ) grows to be a fighter in ancient Britannia . When he catches the eye of one of the promoters for gladiatorial fights in Pompeii , he is taken back to that ancient city . Along the way he encounters Cassia ( Emily Browning ) when one of the horses pulling her carriage falls . He catches her eye not just because of his looks but because he puts down the horse in the most humane way possible.Cassia gets to Pompeii before the slaves on their way . It turns out that her father Severus ( Jared Harris ) is the ruler of the city . Severus is trying to promote the city into a minor version of Rome and is aided in doing so by his wife Aurelia ( Carrie-Anne Moss ) . While pleased to see their daughter home once more they have yet to find out why she came back from Rome . That is explained later when now Senator Corvus arrives to negotiate with Servus for assistance to rebuild the city . Of course , he uses his desire to marry Cassia to eventually seal the deal.Meanwhile Milo finds himself in the slave quarters of the gladiators and a target of another slave whose brother he killed . While he survives that the odds of his surviving the arena are slim , even more so when the plan is to have him face off against his cell mate Atticus ( Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje ) , a slave who is about to win his freedom if he defeats his 19th opponent . The pair square off during practice when an attempt is made once more on Milo only to be stopped by Atticus . While each knows they will one day face off against one another in the arena , a bond develops between the two.In the background of these stories is the mountain that rises above Pompeii that seems to be developing into eruption mode . Since we know the story of Pompeii there is little suspense formed by this except wondering just when it will finally blow.A change in plans in the arena has Milo and Atticus united to face off against the Romans . It 's at this time that Corvus makes known his intentions for Cassia to her parents . It also happens to be when things begin to happen with the mountain filling the next 30-40 minutes with tons of special effects and carnage . Even with all of that happening a final face off between good guys and bad must take place.Shot using tons of green screen the movie does a good job of making you believe you 're looking at an ancient city , but then again used as much as it is your belief starts to dwindle after a while . The explosive effects of the last portion of the movie are well made but at the same time stretch your ability to suspend belief as the main characters all just fall short of being engulfed in flames , fireballs , earthquakes or floods.The acting has no standouts here and is fair for the most part . Surprisingly the one performance that disappointed me the most was from Sutherland whose English accent in a movie set in ancient Rome falls flat . Browning 's performance as Cassia lacks the depth and believability to carry off the story . Part of that is due to the love at first sight story telling that has her fall for Milo without any hesitation whatsoever.On the whole POMPEII is n't a terrible movie but it is n't a really good one either . It 's one of those movies you probably wo n't be too disappointed in seeing if you like the genre , but not one that you 'll want to revisit again after watching . As I watched the movie I kept thinking back to how great movies like SPARTACUS and GLADIATOR really were . When you think of another movie you want to see again while watching the one in front of you , it 's not a sign of how good that movie is .	-1
I am a big movie fan . Love movies and go regularly . I had high hopes for Pompeii , but about 30 minutes in I realized this was a real turkey . There was nothing factual about it , nothing that I could see . A stupid love story was the focus of the story , while a volcano was coincidentally erupting in the background . I can not recommend this flick unless you choose to sit down and smoke a little pot and watch it with friends who have great senses of humor .	-1
I thought this was about a volcano and chance of survival . Gladiator vs. gladiator just did n't match the movie . A waste of my time .	-1
Paul W. S. Anderson 's & # 34 ; Pompeii & # 34 ; is a throwback to all those sword-and- sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period-piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting , action and romance . This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius , the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D. , burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job , & # 34 ; Game of Throne 's & # 34 ; Kit Harrington plays Milo , a Celtic boy who , after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire , is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator . When he 's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena , he catches the eye of Cassia ( Emily Browning ) , a thoroughly anachronistic , sassy , forward-looking , freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood-soaked pastimes as fight-to-the-death battles in the coliseum . A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre , & # 34 ; Pompeii & # 34 ; is just chockablock with stock characters , cheesy dialogue and corny plotting , though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and , dare I say it , even quite brave finale.But , of course , anyone who checks out & # 34 ; Pompeii & # 34 ; will be doing so strictly to witness , albeit vicariously , all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top . Apparently , overproduced , CGI-infested disaster movies are our milder , modern-day equivalent to gladiatorial contests . And in that respect , at least , the movie delivers the goods.There 's one thing that & # 34 ; Pompeii , & # 34 ; fortunately , does n't have in common with those toga-wrapped spectacles of the past - and that is their extraordinary length . So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes , & # 34 ; Pompeii & # 34 ; has at least one thing going for it .	-1
Pointless in the very end is all I can say about Pompeii . It really just seemed to go nowhere while trying to mix the ancient times stuff with the & # 34 ; Oh no , it 's gon na blow & # 34 ; stuff .	-1
Pompeii is a movie about the last days and the destruction of the city by the volcano Etna.Although it is based on a historical fact , the rest is just a story , a scenario that is an amalgamationof various movies , especially a copy of the & # 34 ; Gladiator. & # 34 ; Because without the violence and the fighting it would have been a really boring movie anda box office failure.In contrast with other destruction movies , the destruction here is at the end , and there is not a lotof it time-wise . But the special effects are really good and make up for waiting through the movieto watch it . The tension builds really good and it is satisfying and it is the only reason towatch the movie.All in all , it is not a bad movie and you can watch happily any time of day	-1
I ca n't really give an honest assessment because I shut it off after 30 minutes . But I can honestly feel good about myself for doing so in that I saved an hour of my life from witnessing this sad car wreck of a wannabe scifi horror thriller .	-1
& # 34 ; Almost Human & # 34 ; is shorter than & # 34 ; Cloverfield & # 34 ; and has around an 8-minute end credit sequence solely to be long enough to be entered into the festival circuit . This may make it seem like the sci-fi horror film is rushed along , but its fast pace is actually fairly comfortable and it fits the film very well . The film draws influences from some of the most respectable cult classics . The opening credits and the film mostly taking place in the middle of the woods gives it a & # 34 ; Friday the 13th & # 34 ; atmosphere while the music seems like the forgotten score John Carpenter never released . As the film progresses , you 're immediately reminded of & # 34 ; The Thing & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Halloween & # 34 ; during the final act . The violent , murderous rampage also has some better than decent yet not quite great gore thanks to its practical makeup effects.It 's difficult to root for Seth though because he 's so twitchy . While Jen seems to have forgotten everything that happened the night Mark disappeared , Seth just wants to wake her up to the nightmarish sights and sounds he does remember . He is n't heroic and he does n't want to save anyone . He just wants his life to go back to normal after Jen told the media that he was behind everything and it ruined his life . In other words , Seth only cares about himself.There 's this entire sequence where Seth does n't seem to understand anything anyone is telling him . He mutters the phrase , & # 34 ; What 's that supposed to mean , & # 34 ; several times in less than five minutes . Mark always seems to ask questions without giving anyone a chance to actually answer . He asks a man cutting firewood why he 's living in his house before blasting him with a shotgun and thrusting a hatchet into the back of his skull before the poor guy can give an actual answer . Seth is trying to load a rifle while Jen is in trouble . He & # 8217 ; s rushed and in a panic , but can & # 8217 ; t seem to get any of the shells into the actual gun . So he just throws the entire supply on the floor . While the film has several positive influences , the other influences are n't so great . & # 34 ; Jason Goes to Hell & # 34 ; is passable since the acting in that sequel is some of the best in the & # 34 ; Friday the 13th & # 34 ; series , but & # 34 ; Almost Human & # 34 ; is a lot like & # 34 ; Dreamcatcher & # 34 ; at the end of the day and that 's something no film should try to ride the coattails of. & # 34 ; Almost Human & # 34 ; would be a decent first film for anyone , but its abrupt ending and familiarities hurt it more than anything else . Nothing is really explained by the end of the film and you 're left wondering why aliens have a thing about turning our televisions on , making prank calls , turning the lights on and off , and possess impregnating elongated mouth funnels . While & # 34 ; Almost Human & # 34 ; pays homage to some truly great horror and sci-fi films of the past , it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation .	-1
This whole season is a overlong , tedious remake of the movie . Anyone who would be interested in the series has already has already seen the far superior movie . It should have either done the movie in the pilot and given us new material from then on , or just started up after the incident at the bar in Mexico . It has that weird pacing and dialog of a Rodriguez/Tarentino movie , sort of : its too slow . You need to really be in the mood for this type of picture.I would not recommend this entire series as is . It is a great idea , has RR doing the directing , etc . but it does n't click .	-1
I swear nothing original out of Hollywood in several decades . So you took the movie & # 34 ; From Dusk Till Dawn & # 34 ; , remade it , then split it up into several parts and made a TV series out of it ! ? OMFG Why ! ? I saw the original a million times so I 'll be damned if I pay for 7-16 episodes of a crappy remake where I KNOW whats going to happen next . These are some whack ass actors too , dude is NO George Clooney & the nutcase is NO Quentin Tarantino *LoL* ... ... . I guess season 2 will be a remake of & # 34 ; From Dusk Till Dawn 2 & # 34 ; split into 16 episodes and season 3 will be & # 34 ; From Dusk Till Dawn 3 & # 34 ; split into 21 episodes . HA ! Pathetc ... .DISCLAIMER : Being that Amazon & # 34 ; comments section & # 34 ; is becoming too much like YouTube comments due to ignorant people with no lives , I have to make this disclaimer . F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review , as well other peoples review . I turned the & # 34 ; notification & # 34 ; feature off a long time ago because I could n't careless about anyone 's feedback . So your stupid commentary WILL fall on deaf ears . So STFU in advance also . Have a good one : )	-1
I watched all ten episodes . There are a couple very cool action scenes ( both involving Don Johnson ) but the rest of the series is very hard to get through . Unlikeable characters and bad writing . Very disappointing .	-1
The radio station hostage script has been done a few times before - some with funny intent , some tragic . This script started out with a bit of creative dialogue such as the following , which I enhanced a bit : `` Easy way to solve their problems , Judaism & Islam , is to merge the two and they can gang up ( declare war ) on what they both hate - pigs ; we 'll call it Jislam . `` Well , from that high point onward it was just stereotypic narcissistic , self-aggrandizement and predictable , railing against the boss , hostage taking.What made the movie really uncomfortable is knowing in the back of my mind all the hostage taking with tragic consequences that have recently occurred in schools in the US and in countries such as Nigeria and Iraq . The plot makes light of all , similar events - difficult to justify a script knowing all of that .	-1
But hey , Amazon only charges $ 100./yr for & # 34 ; Prime & # 34 ; membership to watch all the trash we wish for no extra fee ! This is the last time I 'll be signing up for it .	-1
Really bad . Could n't get past first few minutes .	-1
I am a fan of Sister Wives and it seems like this family is too ( at least Brady is ) and have been watching them & practicing what to say on camera once they got their own show . I 'm not sure if this was all Bradys idea & the wives are forced to go along with it ( which seems the case with most things ) or if they all just really were hoping that TLC would pay for some huge mansions like the Browns got ( hence the push to move somewhere else from the first episode ) ? ALL of the wives seem so afraid to `` make waves '' that they are very obviously repressing almost all emotion especially in the presence of each other & their `` master '' . Paulie looks like its affecting her the worst , the only time she really had a REAL smile seemed to be when they were drinking , the rest of the time when she does rarely smile they just seemed forced and sad . She may be forced to talk about the good side of her family life , but her anger and depression is written all over her face at all times.It really strikes a nerve with me EVERY time that Brady talks about what a `` beautiful thing '' polygamy is , of course its beautiful for you douche bag , you 've got 5 different women taking care of ALL of your children FOR you and `` behaving themselves '' so that they wont be passed over to be the next one to beg at your feet for scraps of your limited attention . Of course YOU are happy , all your needs are being met while they all suffer in lonely depression . It seems like he has all these wives and children so that he has every excuse not to be personally responsible for any of them `` oh i 'm sooooo busy but going to school for philosophy sounds like a good thing to waste some more time on '' ... .seriously ? ! What an egotistical jerk ! He cant even begin to open his eyes to see how much all of these women he says he `` loves '' are SUFFERING ! Wake up dirt bag , while your talking about how `` beautiful '' everything is , they are talking about how hard it really is , their obviously painful jealousy , and trying desperately to get your attention ANY way they can think of it ( adoption , pregnancy , weight issues , empty nest , holiday party , etc ) . For someone with so many women in his life , he does n't seem to get them or want to understand them at all , or maybe he just does n't want to face the fact that he is the single biggest source of pain in all of these womens hearts ( oh sorry I mean ache , blah ) . Watching him time after time put the needs of his wives last & joking about things that make them all so uncomfortable is just horrible.Like the show is so aptly named `` MY five wives '' , meaning its all about HIM and living his fantasy dream life . Why does HE get to be the one who decides if and where they will all move ? ! He acts like its a vote , but you can tell its not , like most everything else , its whatever will make HIM happiest . Why do a couple wives get to have the amount of children they want but the others have to beg and cry for their fair share ? Were those other wives better `` behaved '' so they got what they wanted ? Why does one get to adopt while another has to beg for a baby of her own ? Why does one wife get called `` beautiful '' every day but the others have to beg for complements ( especially the poor absolutely gorgeous full figured one ) ? If each of the adults have to cook dinner one day a week , why does n't HE ? ! And how horrible of him to show up in the MIDDLE of his kids karate event ( and the wife & child both seem soooo greatful for that 15min ) what kind of father is that ? ! And why on earth are they all called `` aunt so & so '' to the children , they are n't aunts , they are MOTHERS of all of your children and should be given the name & respect that comes with it ! Why is chatting it up with the guys at work so much more important than even remembering to show up to meet your wife for something YOU asked her to do for you ? ! How dare you take that woman for granted ! Get a darn organizer or planner if its that hard for you to remember everything ! I feel so sorry for the kids brought up in this environment , no wonder so many of them want to leave and cant wait to go live a normal life . Why would they want to live polygamy after growing up watching their moms suffer like this ? ! This show is just painful to watch . Yes , the Browns have their issues too but they do n't seem afraid to confront them head on & together without obvious scripting . And yes Kody is an egotistical douche bag too , but at least he really does seem to TRY to be a better husband and father and at least he has n't completely broken the spirit of 5 beautiful women . I will continue to watch only because I will be hoping with every fiber of my being that these women start to stand up for themselves & stop being such depressing lap dogs ! Your so much better than that ladies !	-1
What in the world are `` progressive polygamists , '' as the Williamses , the subjects of this series , claim to be ? Seems like a contradiction in terms.Polygamy is not a progressive lifestyle by any means , never was and never will be . It 's a male-centered lifestyle , in which all the women -- and , in this case , 24 ( ! ) children -- fight for one man 's attention . I can understand people practicing polygamy because it 's their religious conviction to do so , as the Browns from Sister Wives claim , but the Williamses say they no longer hold true to the doctrines of Fundamental Mormonism , or the FLDS church . So they apparently now choose this lifestyle -- or , as I see it , it 's too late to change things . So now what ? Are they stuck ? Must be because what woman in her right mind would choose to share her husband with four other women if it 's not something she believes will get her into heaven for time and all eternity ? I wonder what this family is teaching the children.That it 's OK for a man to have a number of women even though it 's not dictated by their religion or condoned by society ? ( Do these `` progressives '' also believe it 's OK for a woman to have multiple husbands ? ) And what religion do they now practice ? Surely , there is no other Christian religion that is OK with polygamy . This family seems a bit of a jumble.A lot of reviewers claim the women , who are all cousins born in polygamous families in the same region of Utah in which the clan currently resides , appear to be depressed , and I would concur . Paulie is lovely , but she rarely cracks a smile and seems to not enjoy being in front of the camera . Rosemary is at least truthful . I like her honesty regarding jealousy and weight issues . Nonie is harsh , but seems bright . Rhonda and Robyn are kind and sweet but they too have that same glazed expression as the others.Several episodes into the season , we have n't learned much about the children , though . They 're not really featured in the story lines and no one child stands out above the others . The boys tend to be unruly and it 's understandable , as the family has no table around which to eat and mealtimes often become chaotic . Manners fall by the wayside . ( You 'd think contractor Brady could build one dining hall for the entire family to eat in instead of having to hold plates on laps . ) Brady , who does not seem to be all that charismatic or appealing , tries to appease all the women . Of course that is impossible , we all know that . And every conversation when there 's a problem or disagreement among the women or they with Brady seems staged . He seems to be reading from some conflict resolution handbook every time he answers them . He always says , `` I hear what you 're saying , '' and then he repeats their grievance and gives some kind of wishy-washy answer but that is often just what the woman wants to hear . His responses , frankly , do n't seem natural and I wonder if he would be so kind and understanding if the cameras were n't filming.Despite what appears to be playing to the cameras , some of the women claim that he is not always very fair -- and it does appear that he has favorites -- but how is it possible to love five women at once and be fair to everyone ? It 's the lifestyle in and of itself that does n't promote fairness .	-1
What a fake boring waste of time . Seems like its scripted with bad acting . Wo n't ever watch again . Maybe he should get wife # 6 and get rid of these , lol	-1
The show is diverting and interesting but seriously too light weight . Viewers are capable of dealing with much more depth than the show provides . A Brit would say the host is too cheeky for the subject matter !	-1
I liked the everyday language used , but I would have preferred more actual field work . The camera work was jerky at times , unnecessarily so it seemed to me , I suppose it was to make the viewer feel like being part of the action . It just annoyed me .	-1
Different type of a way to introduce the subject at hand . Because of this I stayed to watch this episode but after got tired of the host being too intrusive that he started being the target of interest instead of the main subject.One episode was all I could take . The subject matter though was very interesting.Video quality awesome Thanks Amazon !	-1
This show is poorly made , unprofessional , and boring . The host seems to barely know what he is talking about , and the content is filled with speculation and rumors . Do n't waste your time !	-1
the program was too short , needs to be an hour , and he stretches the science and it seems like information is left out	-1
The subject matter is fascinating but the series narrator and travel guide is not . His goal seems to be to prove that parts of the Bible are literally true in an historical sense . This is fine but he is n't .	-1
Too many sharks jumped in first three episodes	-1
Well , this show started out okay , but has now degenerated into the & # 34 ; pin it on Mark Valley & # 34 ; hour . The network can end this tragedy at any time and I will miss it not one bit .	-1
I was bored and looking for something to watch . Even as bored as I often am , this show is not worth it . Its not an individual episode show , its more 24 with ones plot and increasing complications . And a lot of characters to keep track of . One detail that stood out and bugged me was Gillian Anderson . She 's a wonderful actress , who I remember X-Files . Blond does not work .	-1
The cast and the previews looked worth watching ... I watched episode 1 and within the first sequence I knew what was going to happen and I knew who was the & # 34 ; bad guy & # 34 ; . Dermot Mulroney , who plays the bad guy , looks terrible ... dirty and dingy and not-watchable.The premise is stupid . I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country ( including the president 's son ) , ALL are on a bus ... a & # 34 ; normal & # 34 ; field trip ... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found ... AND no security ON the bus ... AND a crazy ex-FBI ( or other 3-letter word agent ) is on the bus with them . Seriously ! First , is n't a secret service agent to be WITH the president 's kid at ALL times , WITH him , by his side , ON the bus ? Second , none of these other high-powered people have security around their kids at all ... and third , a field trip , a freaking field trip . Where the hell where they going ? What field trip with 16-17 year olds ? WHERE ARE THEY GOING ? And ... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family . They are NOT to be compromised . But oh ... wait ... if I buy into this premise , of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes . Then it gets better ... & # 34 ; send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch & # 34 ; yeah , the one other secret service vehicle ... WHAT ? ... oh , but wait.. it gets better ... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block ... AND ... let 's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president 's son and just see what 's going on ... WHAT ? All of that in the first 15 minutes ... I 'm suppose to buy that ... but oh ... I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers ... ummm ... no.Gillian Anderson , bless her heart ... she looks good but that 's about it . No emotion ... none ! And she did have a line for that something about ... & # 34 ; I 'm not going to be this way for long & # 34 ; ... WHAT ? oh ... but wait ... the bad guy , is of course , the BEST at what he does ... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup ... and the FBI ( or some other 3-letter agency ) just fired him for something that he , of course , did not do , and let him go on his merry way.One positive note : The storyline with the new-to-the-job secret service agent was pretty good . IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day , which is where it is seemingly headed . I was engaged with this part . I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I did n't care about the rest of the story . I just wanted it to be over . However , the series could be saved . If I was writing it , I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over . Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; bad guy . And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI screwed up . But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course , saving the day.Anyway , this is bad . I could probably pick apart every scene . The suspense is forced . The story itself should produce the suspense . Suspense is not just drawing out a situation , making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be ... what would you do to protect your child ? ... Well , it did n't seem that any of those high-powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection . So I guess the answer is ... not so much ... along with my rating .	-1
As a fan of political dramas , I decided to give & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; a try because it looked like a very interesting premise . Plus , being an X-Files junkie , I was curious about Gillian Anderson 's return to network TV . Those assumptions did hold ... for about two episodes . After that , unfortunately , the show turns into a standard crime procedural lacking any sort of & # 34 ; new ground & # 34 ; .After the first two episodes of & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; , I thought that I had found the next great political drama . A group of high-society prep students on a school field trip ( one being the son of the President of the United States ) are kidnapped and held hostage . It is very interesting to see the different dynamics between the students and how they all react a little bit differently to the situation . Even the heavily-advertised Gillian Anderson return is a hit , as her character adds a toughness angle to the show that seems intriguing.Sadly , that is where the innovation of this show ends . For the next 3/4 episodes , it turns into a complete procedural . It has the stereotypical & # 34 ; one male , one female F.B.I . agent & # 34 ; ( played by Lance Gross & Rachael Taylor ) premise , and follows a & # 34 ; one parent of a hostage each week & # 34 ; approach to storytelling . It is sad , because had the show-runners been able to focus on the relationships between the teen hostages themselves , THAT is where the interesting material was . As soon as the focus shifted to the parents , it became tedious and un-inspiring . Even Anderson 's character has been pretty much in invisible since those first couple episodes.I compare & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; to a show like & # 34 ; Intelligence & # 34 ; on CBS . Both shows had great kernels of concepts/ideas , but instead of truly breaking ground with original storytelling , the networks instead shoe-horn those interesting plots into tired TV storytelling conventions . Both shows were also advertised as something almost completely different from what they turned out to be . Much like & # 34 ; Intelligence & # 34 ; , I would be surprised if & # 34 ; Crisis & # 34 ; gets a renewal for a second season . It just does n't differentiate itself enough from other similar & # 34 ; stock & # 34 ; fare on television these days .	-1
I do n't know what the muck these people were thinking when the funded this movie . What a bunch of muckups !	-1
Might have been fun for them to make , but I could n't sit through more than 15 minutes of it . Indie bad .	-1
Boring sad women some need meds and others ( turtle time ) had plenty . By the way Mario is a supercilious snake who ai n't all that and a bag of chips . Thank you for the vent Carla Tamari	-1
I admit to watching it over the years , but it has hit an all time low . Ramona 's behavior is oddd and we are tired of it . You should have kept some of the other women versus her when you made firings .	-1
RAMONA SINGER IS REPULSIVE . When is someone just going to kick her ass ! She deserves NOTHING BUT : the misery she inflicts upon others with her obnoxious irrational behavior that is downright unacceptable ! She is a violent , CRAZY OLD B***H that should be removed from the show . EXPIRATION=UP ! I 'd like to see her get on Heather 's bad once more ... , maybe Ramona will finally get what 's coming to her .	-1
Pretty regular network attempt at entertainment ... Bland indeed , lacking any sense of risk taking . Wo n't last long at all on TV	-1
Pros : Acting and filming were ok.Some of the plot points were ok - who does n't like extra-normal abilities ? Cons : Girl was annoying and her actions would get people killed.Show also has a definite naive pacifistic slant - which is a major negative . One of the characters actually says & # 34 ; We 're good guys so we do n't use guns. & # 34 ; Oh please ! Real good guys use what 's necessary to protect the innocent.The whole & # 34 ; save the musician/writer/poet because their words will change the world & # 34 ; thing has been done to death.Might watch another episode or two but not many more if it keeps the same direction .	-1
I usually wait a while to watch a new series until I know whether it 's been renewed or cancelled . This was cancelled yesterday , May 9th ( along with my favorite sitcom Community ) . I watched quite a few episodes , and it 's bad . Even by JJ Abrams standards , though it 's not as bad as Revolution.The plot is as follows : The girl ( Bo ) has psychic abilities off the charts and she was 'rescued ' from a government project that may have been trying to develop her as a weapon . Bo 's `` rescuers '' reunite her with her dad , who was on death row . The reason he was on death row was completely resolved half a dozen episodes later . The evil director of the facility that was studying Bo wants her back and they enlist the FBI -- the sole presence of which is a youngish brunette in a pony tail . That 's the back story.In nearly every episode:1 . Their safe house gets compromised and they have to flee2 . Bo gets a vision about a normal person who needs help . She tugs and tugs on her father 's arm until he gives in.. reluctantly.3 . The 'bad guys ' enlist a psychic to find her or turn on a psychic machine that reads psychic emissions ( wtf ? ) 4 . Bo and her dad hug the people they save5 . The bad guys are shown to have another ace up their sleeveThey state at the onset that Bo needs a normal childhood because she is so powerful she could bring peace to the world . However , nobody shows a trace of growth . Every person 's personality is completely fixed and no experience changes anyone , even slightly.JJ Abrams is n't even trying anymore . He comes up with a plot ( this time shamelessly ripped off from Touch ) , and cranks out a dozen poorly thought out episodes before being handed another series ( and the reins to both Star Trek and Star Wars ) . When I see JJ Abrams name on a series , I know I 'm getting a polished turd . I feel like I spent more time on my review than JJ Abrams did with the series.And from certain angles , that girl is a dead ringer for a skinny Honey Boo Boo .	-1
Bo is a supernatural , extraordinary girl with psychic powers . The problem is many groups and authorities are after her and each one of them wants to use her for their own devices wither it 's evil or good . Now , Winter the closest thing Bo had to a father figure has been trying to protect her from falling in the wrong hands . In order to do so , he frees Tate an ex convict from Prison and asks him to guard Bo and make sure she stays safe.And so they hit the road , except it 's really difficult for them to stay unnoticed considering how the police are looking for Tate and they are also looking for Bo . There 's a lot of twists and turns into the story and it 's only been 4 episodes out so far.Personally , this show is n't all terrible , it has it 's decent moments it could be entertaining on a boring school/work night . However , the characters are so unlikable it 's daunting and the plot is n't all that solid to compensate for that fact . Bo especially is the worse , she 's very annoying and I have no idea why she even needs to be protected by anyone . Every single time they get into trouble or Tate gets almost caught by the police she seems very capable of helping herself and everyone around her out of the situation with her magical super powers . She also is extremely obnoxious and a know it all.Tate on the other hand is your typical bad boy image who is everything but ... I think the producers failed on creating that one . He 's a criminal so obviously that gives him a sense of danger but he was also wrongfully accused and to be honest he seems so lost in the whole thing . Like he just does n't know what he wants to do with his life.Winter is also annoying . He spends most of his time protecting Bo and he even quits from his job , isolates himself from his family just to protect Bo from those so called evil organisations that want her in their team . A bit too extreme ? do n't you think maybe he could 've sent her some other country away from all of this instead of having to follow her around till eternity ? I get he 's doing the noble thing but his character is too good to be true.The rest of the cast are equally annoying .	-1
We 're only two episodes into this new NBC drama and it 's already fallen apart at the seams . The show opens with Cuaron 's directorial trademark of a technically clever tracking shot and after that it devolves into an incredibly dull series of totally unbelievable chases with absolutely zero character growth or plot development.The girl is blessed with some sort of telekinetic capability that she uses whenever the plot needs an escape catch . With this superpower , she should be the least vulnerable human on the planet but instead succumbs to an inept series of bad guys who ca n't decide whether to capture or kill her . She also seems to & # 34 ; sense & # 34 ; people 's problems to get the B plot of the week going so she can run around helping people in between the good guys messing things up.The writing is on par with a first draft from a mediocre screenwriting student at a bad film school and it 's almost inconceivable it was used for production . Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script ( & # 34 ; You 're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution. & # 34 ; / & # 34 ; You were trained at Quantico and now you 're working on the Tate case & # 34 ; ) . Hardly anything is said that is n't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I 'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near-telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm 's way , except when they use their own near-telepathic knowledge to protect her . The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it ( hey , there 's a bag of money on a fire escape in New York that 's still there ) and gives the audience no idea of where it 's going beyond & # 34 ; we 're going to the safe house & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; we 're going to Philadelphia & # 34 ; - why not let 's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun ? Oh , and then major characters disappear - the laughably bad assassin from the pilot presumably did n't test well with the audience , even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys , bad guys ( Kyle MacLachlan phones it in ) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere . They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we 're at the end of the episode . And there 's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer-thin plot forward so very , very slowly . There has n't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden , the dialog is stilted , the fight scenes are horribly shot , there no tension , there 's no suspension of disbelief and there 's no plot . How can it get any worse ? Cuaron just won an Oscar but I suspect he 's now lending his name like & # 34 ; Steven Spielberg Presents & # 34 ; - take away his and JJ Abrams ' writing credits and here you have a show that would otherwise simply never be aired . It 's a total train wreck of irredeemably poor writing and production that 's reminiscent of the worst days of the Glen A Larson 's factory weeklies . Absolute drivel in every respect and I 'm embarrassed to say I watched two of these .	-1
Ohmy . I used to think that the brand J.J. Abrams meant something good . Now I guess it means that he is being well paid to put his name behind even beyond bad products . Like this . There is not a single redeeming quality that excuses this disaster . The general plot is so bad , repetitive , and predictable as are the plots of each episode . Having a cute lovely child as main character does n't do anything to mitigate the fact that the plot , the dialogues , and the acting are just terrible . Renegade group of scientists / good rebels help little paranormally gifted girl to escape from being used by mean scientist and government as a weapon . She is paired with a man wrongfully accused of murder , who is rescued from his own execution ( an absolutely unnecessary `` plot twist '' -- faux pas really ) . This guy is her dad , which you know in about 5 seconds , but he is very very very slow and the only person in the universe for whom it takes a couple of terribly bad episodes to discover the obvious . And even though she controls minds and objects and reads situations and people and changes reality , they are utterly unable of doing anything decently well . Except , of course , being very , but very , really good samaritans ( in case the blonde hair illuminated by an unsourced light was too sutil , you might need clues to understand that she is angelical ) . So , they escape all the time . The little angel and the wrongly persecuted criminal . None of whom should be in the acting career . Let 's hope they catch them soon and put an end to our misery .	-1
Good guys , bad guys and a little girl who could be used for either . The good guys do an unbelievably bad job of being good . The bad guys do an unbelievably bad job of being bad and the little girl is totally confused . She knows she has some special capabilities but does n't seem to know why . OK , she 's a little girl , so let that one go for a while.However , both the good guys and the bad guys know that the little girls capabilities could be used as a & # 34 ; weapon & # 34 ; . Presumably a weapon of mass destruction or something to do with world domination . Yeah , right , now that 's totally believable.From the little bits and pieces thrown in all over the place the following seems to be the story line : Some rich guy got mixed up in genetic mutation and found he could manipulate people with & # 34 ; special & # 34 ; capabilities . Some of the people who worked for the rich guy did n't like the direction he was going so they split and became the & # 34 ; good guys & # 34 ; , leaving the rich guy and whoever he had left to be the & # 34 ; bad guys & # 34 ; . But the plot thickens . The good guys kidnap ( that 's a crime ) a little girl because they can see that the bad guys are going to use her for no good . Then they break a convicted criminal out of jail to be the girls & # 34 ; protector & # 34 ; . And if we believe the sub plot , this crim really is a bad guy . Even the little girl picks up on it . The guy looks at her and tears develop . The girl tells him he 's crying because he used to be good once . That implies that he really is bad now . But I 'm innocent he says . And the & # 34 ; wise & # 34 ; little girl says , that 's what everyone in jail claims . So why have the good guys picked this one particular & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; guy to be her protector . Because ... .wait for it ... .because he 's her father . Wow ! ! Ok , so it is a very confusing tale ( so far at least ) but none of that is helped by the twists and turns that simply go unanswered and are all left to our imagination . Take the female assassin . Not a very good one as she fails in every attempt . So she just up and disappears from the scene to be replaced by a male assassin who obviously is n't any better . Take the scenario at the casino . The & # 34 ; protector & # 34 ; convinces the girl to use her capabilities to help him win some money ( to replace the bag full he left on a fire escape ) . So rightly or wrongly , she helps him rip off a craps table to the tune of 30K . When he notices that the girl is no longer sitting in the eatery , he panics , cashes in his chips and leaves to find the kid . Now during his sojourn at the craps table , there was a craps table boss . He had never seen this guy before and so when he ups and leaves , this & # 34 ; table boss & # 34 ; knows nothing about him other than he was a big winner who suddenly cashed in his chips and left.So we break to the & # 34 ; table boss & # 34 ; who sneaks out into the stair well for a quick smoke . The male assassin follows him out and starts to beat the crap ( no pun intended ) out of the craps table boss , expecting him to know everything about the big winner , like who he is , where he went and on and on the saga goes , becoming more unbelievable with every word that is spoken and every disjointed scene that is played out.There is one theme in the show ( I suspect a story line stolen from another show ) where the little girl does something & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; for someone . In the first episode it was a young doctor who wanted to toss in the towel . In the second episode it was a young boy who needed really expensive life saving treatment . If my suspicions are correct , this story line will continue throughout the rest of the series and some where amongst all the confusion that is the show , the girl will find someone to do something good for in each ensuing episode.I find it hard to believe that people like JJ Abrahams and organizations like Bad Robot got involved in something as poorly produced as this . I just hope they got their money up front , because I do n't & # 34 ; believe & # 34 ; it will last . What a title for a show . & # 34 ; Believe & # 34 ; . Unfortunately it is so & # 34 ; unbelievable & # 34 ; that it makes a mockery of the title .	-1
This felt very derivative and uninspired . Yet another spooky , extraordinary child on the run from the government and/or emotionless European assassins . Yawn .	-1
I have just seen to much about this subject . I just was not interested in keeping up a weekly show about this subject	-1
The previews led me to watch this because I like the premise and I love Delroy Lindo . But even Delroy is not worth watching in this ... I could n't even understand what he was saying most of the time.The pilot was just done wrong . It seems like someone had a great idea but did n't know how to write the story ... thinking the great idea would just MAKE the show good . Sloppy . Lazy.The young actress is good . She has a nice screen presence . The co-star playing her father is a bad actor . I 've seen him in other things and he 's always & # 34 ; acting like an actor. & # 34 ; He is not enjoyable to watch . His only emotion is some over-the-top bad-guy-that-takes-no-responsibility-for-his-life.I do n't understand why they even put this show out there . I ca n't see it getting better with the lead actor they 've cast.I Believe , in the pretty little actress . That 's all the show has going for it . Regroup . Re-cast . Hire some writers.I tried to give it two stars ... I could n't do it because it is something I do n't want to watch again .	-1
There are a handful of directors who have created such buzz surrounding their distinct voices that there is talk about them , their films and their methods with every film , before , after and even long after he & # 8217 ; s moved on to something else . Lars von Trier is probably the king of this . Since his start in the early 90 & # 8217 ; s , von Trier has graced audiences ( small audiences , but audiences ) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality , sexism and masochism . Sometimes , he finds ways to shade his own ideas , philosophies , theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted , making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.Now , I & # 8217 ; ve been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision . While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films , I & # 8217 ; ve stood my ground and played devil & # 8217 ; s advocate in his favor . & # 8216 ; Antichrist & # 8217 ; was a pretty disturbing film , but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Trier & # 8217 ; s madness , and while it didn & # 8217 ; t all translate how he would have liked ( or at least how the audience would have liked ) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain , and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film ( such a fearless performance , through and through ) .I can & # 8217 ; t defend this. & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac : Vol . 1 & 2 & # 8217 ; is basically a four hour film that recounts a young woman & # 8217 ; s many , many , many sexual trysts . Pretending to exploit ( here we go again with exploitation in film ) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women , especially in a sexual context , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of & # 8216 ; chapters & # 8217 ; that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere . Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist , Seligman , and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; is probably one of the most self-absorbed and self-indulgent films I & # 8217 ; ve ever had the displeasure of seeing.I think that Lars von Trier has a deep-seated interest in uncovering the depths of a woman & # 8217 ; s psyche . I don & # 8217 ; t think that he is a misogynist at all . In fact , I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject : & # 8220 ; He & # 8217 ; s a very provocative filmmaker , but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers . The idea that people debate whether he & # 8217 ; s a misogynist ? People should debate whether people who don & # 8217 ; t even write women are misogynist . The fact is , he & # 8217 ; s dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psyche & # 8212 ; good and bad , light and dark , shadows , textures . The fact that he & # 8217 ; s dedicated a huge part of his talents to that , to me , defies the concept that he doesn & # 8217 ; t have respect , interest , and genuine compassion in women . People should question writers that don & # 8217 ; t even give a d*** about a female character . They are the misogynists. & # 8221 ; Sadly , this respect and intrigue isn & # 8217 ; t seen very well here at all . Instead , & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; feels about as misogynist as they come , and at the end of the day it & # 8217 ; s even worse than that ; the film feels just plain trashy . Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value , but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness , but a clear idea at the core . Most of & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative , and while he tries to find some footing in the film & # 8217 ; s final throws , he never establishes anything concrete within Joe & # 8217 ; s story to hook us to her , to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.There is a point here , but von Trier doesn & # 8217 ; t know what it is.Instead , von Trier treats us to a young girl & # 8217 ; s dissention into depravity . She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age , playing games with her best friend and even forming a club that & # 8217 ; s primary focus was to rack up sexual partners , never forming a lasting relationship with anyone ( no one lay to be repeated ) , and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion , as if none of it matters ( because it doesn & # 8217 ; t ) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree ; and while Joe is pretending she & # 8217 ; s falling in love with Shia LaBeouf ( because that could never happen for real ) , volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey . Sexual pleasure is lost , which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it , Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place , and her man.And then Seligman takes off his pants.There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary . It is all just there to make your eyes hurt ( they will hurt ) and the film & # 8217 ; s primary point seems to center on how Joe & # 8217 ; s disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires , but it & # 8217 ; s not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes . Instead he & # 8217 ; d rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop-out ending.There is such a thing as being bold and fearless , and & # 8216 ; Nymphomaniac & # 8217 ; is both of those things , but it is also soulless and hollow , and when you are both of THOSE things , bold and fearless will only harm you .	-1
Do n't get me wrong - the film did n't offend me . I 'm not easily offended ( I 'm a fan of & # 34 ; Antichrist & # 34 ; for example ) . And the idea of this film sounds great on paper.But it 's so pretentious and silly ; this is the emperor 's new clothes . It 's two things swirled together . One is unrealistic sexual behavior , that came from a male mind like an intricate pornographic fantasy . It reminded me of de Sade 's scribblings , not in a level of sadism but in the fact that it 's masturbatory and personal . Nothing much to do with real sex or real people.This is crossed with silly pretentious conversation . Which is sophomoric . The dialogue is so ridiculous that it makes me blush , not the sex scenes.Von Trier 's films usually sound like solid artistic concepts , but play out badly as slow ponderous things . This is by far the worst one yet though . It 's entirely pointless .	-1
If you really want to see a psychological character study on nymphomania , watch the movie Shame , directed by Steve McQueen . This movie was laborious on every level . So , why the two stars ? Uma Thurman ! She was the one bright spot in this entire dark mess . Her 10 minute performance was perfection ! Maybe Part 2 will reveal more , but sadly , I wo n't waste my time seeing it . I enjoy Lars Von Trier 's other works , this one was a huge disappointment . First comparing her disease with fly fishing . Then the short vignettes with the mother and father . A little more needed to be brought out in this movie to help explain why Jo is the way she is.Do n't waste your time on this , watch Shame instead !	-1
One of the worst efforts at a new series I have ever seen . Do n't spend a cent on this crap .	-1
It has an interesting premise , but struggles to find its legs . First it is a want-a-be Lord of the flies , but then acts more like Earth 2 , if the character were teenagers . The more interesting story is still in space , but that side of the story reads like the first draft of Battlestar ... actually that is too nice.It is something to watch when there is nothing better on . The acting is second-rate , the plot weak , and the imagination dull .	-1
To be fair to the supporters and the critics i tried to like this show.I watched it for the first time at the insistence of a friend who said you will love it , but sadly no i didn't.An unbelievable story line is the first thing that grabbed me , jump to a failing space station who sends a group of kids that have never even seen a tree a stream or felt sunshine to a planet ravaged by radiation after only 90 something years to fend for themselves with no food and no weapons.they then crash onto the planet and things go from bad to worse , pick out the one African American dude and lets persecute him and then kill him over and over again , but trust me its gets far worse.With no weapons they then begin to hunt Animals who have been mutated from exposure to radiation and they do this with clubs and spears , what have you . after they themselves are already weakened by no food and very little water . some of the worst acting i have ever seen combined with so many holes in the plot its like a cheese grater and this fails big time . i ca n't believe someone wrote this and it was published .. can anybody say Terra Nova	-1
Ten bodice ripper	-1
I did n't think the acting was very good . I would n't recommend this series to my family or friends . Story too typical .	-1
The overall premise of the story is good . The fact that the only people sent down are teenagers ? Please . The whole thing is dreadful .	-1
3 episodes was all I could take . The premise is ridiculous ( especially sending down the little girl - what could a 10 year old girl really do to help the cause ? ) , the pace is slow with little payoff , the characters lack charisma and the BEYOND EXCESSIVE use of lens flare on every scene on the space station screamed cheeseball sci-fi . Also , what 's with not having a proper ambient soundtrack ? The use of pop tunes is comical . It 's like it 's amateur hour sci-fi done with the lowest budget possible.If you want to watch a sci-fi human survival drama done right , go watch Battlestar Galactica ( the 2004 version ) or Firefly and skip this mess of a show .	-1
I hate writing bad reviews , but honestly I could n't get past the first episode . If you 're a teen/pre-teen I guess it might be fun . I thought the premise was great but watching the production/acting and shallow characters turned me off immediately . I hope to god sci-fi ( which is already difficult to pull off ) does n't go further down this road .	-1
too much lord of the flies does n't sound interesting at all ! definitely not my type of show at all too depressing .	-1
I 'm surprised at how many positive reviews this show is getting , its pure drivel . Logic holes so big you can drive semi trucks through , horrid dialogue , pure teen formula show complete with theme music for scenes to give & # 34 ; mood/meaning & # 34 ; . How something like this saw enough production to make it live is beyond me and shows just how little studios think of teenagers and the public in general . Either that or our culture really is that bankrupt and intellectually exhausted to where shallow teenage antics are considered worthy story material no matter how stupid the presentation . I could go on , but you really are wasting precious minutes of your life watching this .	-1
Quick Overview : After a nuclear crisis the human race took to space for hundreds of years . Running out of resources they have quickly developed a one-strike rule for criminals . Any violation is grounds for death . Taking a chance officials sent a group of 100 jailed teens to test Earth . They hope it is once again life sustaining . Humanity depends on it.The promise of the plot is phenomenal . The delivery however is lacking . So far it has turned out to be just another drama aimed at teens . There is a bit of romance and hormones mixed with survival and power struggle . Not anything new.The season is still early so I hope the story telling steams ahead . Otherwise , it just turns into another one of many .	-1
Poor acting and scripting , I did n't like this series at all- very corny ! Story was a good idea-Poor translation . The actors were awful !	-1
So Resurrection had a predictably strong opening on network TV and why would n't it ? Set upon the immediately gripping concept of loved ones returning from the dead , the promise of the premise is strong , surely guaranteeing to hit the sweet spot in the Venn diagram of mystery , fantasy and horror . Yet week after week , ABC misses the mark on the show failing to fire on any of the dramatic cylinders that are clearly primed to compete with the ratings juggernaut of the Walking Dead . How could they have messed this up ? As once-dead residents of the IQ-challenged town of Arcadia start to reappear , it 's extraordinary that the least realistic aspect of the show is not the resurrection itself but the staggeringly dumb reaction of any of the characters . Any normal human would ask thousands of questions , wonder if they 're zombies , call the Feds , get extensive medical tests , check the coffins for the bodies , go to pray , start a conspiracy theory website , leave the town - anything , literally anything along these lines that the show refuses to do.Ignoring the vastly obvious pit of story opportunities , the writers are hell-bent on forcing the story logic into a police procedural yet even the cops and thinly-painted medical characters act like they were trained at the same police academy as the FBI from The Following . Instead of taking action on singly the biggest event in recorded history , they do literally nothing and each week the story inches along at glacial speed to the point where I wonder if they remember that these people were dead . It 's almost as if the writers are scared of the plot and have just set up a bunch of generic drama moments hoping for something interesting to happen.In my weekly frustration with this show , I finally decided to check out Les Revenants ( The Returned ) which was a French spin on the idea made a couple of years ago . Cliched as it may sound , this is unfortunately one of those cases where the French original series is so much better that you wonder how the US remake could be so bad . Les Revenants sets up a spooky mystery with a well-selected range of engaging characters , approaching the question of whether the Returned are good or malevolent out to destroy the living without ever becoming ridiculous , giving us some first class acting , dialog and subtle plotting along the way.Resurrection meanwhile is doing none of this and by episode 5 is seriously threatening to jump the shark . Suffering from some of the most unimaginative writing in television today and maybe a network that does n't know which theme and story threads to follow , it 's wasting one of the best story concepts in a long time . Rather than spending countless hours for ABC to find the plot , you can just cue up Netflix and enjoy something vastly superior in The Returned - while you have to wade through English subtitles , it 's better than waiting for anything to happen in this really bland execution of a great concept .	-1
You know what the bible says , right ? The only way divination is possible is through the demons . You should not watch this show , nor should you believe in or follow what she says . The dead & # 34 ; know nothing at all. & # 34 ; They are without thoughts and feelings , for they are DEAD . Anything else anyone tells you is counter to what the Bible teaches and is propaganda originated by the devil . Look it up . It 's true .	-1
I was n't thrilled by the movie . The dialogue needs a lot of work . It just was n't that funny . The family was too much . I ca n't imagine the dad being unemployed six months , hiding it from his wife , being so broke and still going on vacation . I might be able to believe a shorter length of time unemployed and hiding it . But the dad did n't understand GPS yet could pull off hiding six months unemployment ? The mom was the smart one yet she had no idea the finances of her family before a major vacation ? She had no idea for 6 months her husband had no job and was n't paying the bills off ? The daughter was n't even likable . I just did n't get this family and could n't care about them or relate to any of them . I would n't pay to see this . I do think it may be tweakable though . Someone mention a budget Hawaiian vacation . I could see this being pulled off with the dad coming clean about where they are with his unemployment and finances . Then a budget vacation maybe being planned by mom and dad for the kids , who had been promised a trip to Hawaii . Once there , the dad gets caught up in the adventure of the stolen statue . It would be possible to make something from that but characters would need makeovers . Dad could be slightly more aware of technology like GPS , knows about it but is not really tech savvy so he bungles it . Mom could be a bit more savvy on the families finances but loves Dad enough to hide his unemployment and their financial state for one last hurrah for the children . The children could be who they are but without nastiness like calling Dad names when he just forked over Hawaii . It has potential to be a family fun movie but as is falls flat .	-1
This catoon has to much rambling about nothing and it needed more constriction on the heist . The value of the statue should have been made known from the start and who or what organization was behind it and why . The daughter was not polite in calling her father a wiedo . Good luck !	-1
You need to use the type of CGG that & # 34 ; Archer & # 34 ; uses rather than this stiff cartoonish animation . I could not watch past the first 5 minutes.The story is just too ho-hum . I would never even stream the thing let alone go to a theatre to view . Sorry . Try again .	-1
I ordered it by mistake . So I did not watch it . I do n't like horror type movies . To each his own I guess .	-1
Possible spoilers.High concept and no-brain techno-thriller about a young woman using a video chat room as part of a grant-funded project who becomes the target of a high-tech psychopath . Unfortunately every ounce of thought that was put into this movie went into the visual design ( Let 's shoot a movie where all the footage is on web cams and computer screens -- cool ! ) and none apparently went into the threadbare and consistently illogical script.The problems start almost immediately when our heroine pitches her project to the university board . Her pitch is basically I 'm going to use a video chat for three months and find out about people and stuff . Despite the lack of any apparent scientific purpose to her project it 's approved -- and then things rapidly get more idiotic.The Den is one of those video chat sites where you can switch from person to person randomly , pressing next if you do n't like what you see . The filmmakers did n't give any thought to what you might actually see on such a chat site -- what they come up with is and old , overweight woman with too much make-up filming herself laughing like she 's a character in a David Lynch movie ; a group of people who prank unwitting viewers by playing a fake game of Russian roulette ; some guy with a cute dancing penis puppet ; etc . While this is all stuff that would not be out of place on You Tube as filmed video if this were being performed live in a rapid screen chat environment then basically you would have people performing the same bit of performance art over and over and over every 30 seconds or so , which is about as believable as anything else in this train-wreck.The heroine is supposedly tech savvy , yet it 's obvious very early in the movie that her laptop has been hacked and she does absolutely nothing about it . It 's not like she has no options -- she could ask her techi pal who set up the video recording software on her computer to take a look or she could just ditch the infected laptop and use some of her grant money for a new computer . Even after she tells her project adviser from the university that her computer has been hacked she still continues to use it and does nothing to protect herself.Later her boyfriend disappears and she 's sure it 's related to whomever is stalking her via the internet . This is such a basic idea that you would think there 's no way the filmmakers could screw it up but they do . You see not only did the boyfriend disappear but every scrap of furniture in his apartment disappeared as well , leaving nothing behind but a laptop which is on the floor transmitting to the villain ( or villains ) . When someone who has a job and a girlfriend disappears for a day or two without warning they do n't take their furniture with them -- it would have been much less suspicious ( not to mention a lot less work ) if the villain ( or villains ) had grabbed the b.f. without also cleaning out his apartment . Luckily for the villain ( but unfortunate for the heroine as well as common sense ) the police do n't find the situation suspicious at all and tell her to stop wasting their time.The Den actually continues to get worse after that until it finally runs out of even bad ideas and pretty much just turns into an amazingly dumb and gore free knock-off of Hostel if it were directed by Uwe Boll in first-person video game mode.Not recommended unless you are determined to see every single horror movie that comes out this year .	-1

At the age of 34 , Aaron Paul is quite the accomplished actor & # 8211 ; at least on the small screen . You may catch him here and there in various roles , but for the most part , Paul is best known for his outstanding performance in the AMC drug drama , Breaking Bad . For five years , Paul portrayed the quirky Jesse Pinkman , and earned himself several prominent awards , along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor . However , with Breaking Bad having reached its conclusion , it only seems like a natural decision for Paul to try his luck on the big screen . However , not every successful TV actor translates well to the grander stage of film . And , if Need for Speed is any indication about the direction of Paul & # 8217 ; s future in film & # 8211 ; he might want to start rethinking his character choices & # 8230 ; Directed by Scott Waugh ( Act of Valor ) and based on the popular Electronic Arts video game , Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as a garage owner and former racecar driver , Tobey Marshall . He , along with a handful of his closest friends , run the garage & # 8211 ; but Tobey has a hard time finding the money to keep it open . He occasionally takes part in street races for side money , yet it & # 8217 ; s never enough to maintain a level of financial comfort.After successfully winning his latest street race , Tobey and his team are approached by Tobey & # 8217 ; s old rival , Dino Brewster ( Dominic Cooper ) & # 8211 ; a famed driver and car tycoon . Prior to his death , car creator Carol Shelby had been working on a special , supped-up version of the Shelby Mustang , however , he wasn & # 8217 ; t able to complete his work . Brewster enlists Tobey to complete the Mustang , at which point he will pay them a quarter of the car & # 8217 ; s worth & # 8211 ; between two and three million dollars . But , egos get in the way and during a street race between Tobey and Dino & # 8211 ; tragedy lands Tobey in jail for a crime he didn & # 8217 ; t commit.After doing time in jail , Tobey openly breaks parole and heads from New York to California & # 8211 ; but not before enlisting the help of high-end car dealer , Julia Maddon ( Imogen Poots ) . She is able to lend him the same Shelby Mustang from his partnership with Dino and he plans to use it to race Dino in a private , invitation only winner-take-all street race & # 8211 ; coordinated by an internet racing guru , Monarch ( Michael Keaton ) . Tobey also has revenge on the mind and plans to prove his innocence while taking Dino down in the process.In the spirit of the Fast and the Furious franchise , Need for Speed attempts to establish characters with a heavy dose of racing in their backdrop . Unfortunately , Need for Speed doesn & # 8217 ; t present a substantial alternative to the Fast franchise , featuring generic individuals that supposedly have credibility , egos , and reputations & # 8211 ; but only because they are force-fed to the audience without substantiated proof . Even the dialogue between the characters is bothersome , as they spend far too much time and effort rattling off bland one-liners and partaking in soap opera-ish melodrama.For someone as talented as Aaron Paul , he is terribly under utilized in the lead role of this lackluster plot . In fact , I dare say Paul is not ready to be a lead actor based on the result of this film . He goes from a supremely popular television drama to a disappointing undertaking & # 8211 ; and it & # 8217 ; s hard to imagine a role of this nature helping him further his career . His character comes off as a bit of fraud & # 8211 ; and at times , his delivery is terribly fake . Even Paul & # 8217 ; s alleged rivalry with the film & # 8217 ; s villain , portrayed by Dominic Cooper , is dependent on false , over-embellished egos and the chemistry is just not there . Obviously , most of us know Paul is a credible actor , meaning the writing is where the fault lies in this presentation.Meaningful character interaction is completely sacrificed for the sake of adding a near endless about of car chases & # 8211 ; inevitably causing more cut scenes of which the eye is able to keep track . There are quite a few outstanding cars worth your admiration in this flick , including the decked-out Shelby Mustang GT500 , plus the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento , and Koenigsegg Agera R. But , it obviously wouldn & # 8217 ; t be a racing movie until they were all prominently wrecked at high speed & # 8211 ; except for the Koenigsegg , which is ridiculously important to the outcome of the far-fetched story.Regardless of how this film plays our , the countless holes in the plot are undeniable . In one particular scene , Tobey & # 8217 ; s team is traveling next to him in a truck in order to refuel his car , so he doesn & # 8217 ; t have to stop and lose any more precious time ( as if it takes more than just a couple of minutes to fill-up ) . In any event , mere moments later Tobey and his passenger , Julia ( who apparently has nothing better to do than to go on joy-rides with convicts ) , randomly stop for gas . Before , time was of the essence , but now it & # 8217 ; s okay to stop ? Come on ? Seriously ? Naturally , there & # 8217 ; s a police office just happens to be in the gas station parking , who predictably chases them around for a few minutes . Go figure.Overall , Need for Speed as downright ridiculous in every possible manner of thinking & # 8211 ; even more so than the Fast franchise . In the real world , Tobey Marshall would have been quickly apprehended in OJ Simpson fashion , but the odds of him going to jail for his alleged & # 8220 ; crime & # 8221 ; in the first place is next to nothing anyway ( since there & # 8217 ; s traffic cameras everywhere these days ) . This terribly scripted film does a marvelous job of making decent actors look like daytime television actors & # 8211 ; not to mention there is absolutely nothing about this film that drastically ties itself to the popular video game franchise ( and video game film adoptions have a history of being terrible to begin with ) . About the only reason you should see this film is if you & # 8217 ; re a diehard fan of Aaron Paul or simply like to see eye-popping , ridiculously fast cars.GRADE : D+FNDNreview.com	-1
1 . Will there ever be a great video game adaptation ? The other day , I read on a film blog that Splinter Cell finally grabbed a director ( Doug Liman ) and lead ( Tom Hardy ) , which gives me hope ... but it 's really a mind bender that there has n't ever been a great movie based on a video game . I mean , some video games have incredible stories and cinematic element , and somehow they just do n't transfer well on film . Now , just reading months back that there would be a Need for Speed film made me roll my eyes , and I was n't looking at this movie as the 'great hope ' for video game to film greatness , but I was hoping that whoever wrote Need for Speed would n't treat it 's audience like complete morons.2 . Aaron Paul elevates whatever material he 's given.If I 'm being honest ( along with my wife , and probably thousands of others who shelled out their hard earned cash to see Need for Speed ) , the only reason I went to see this was because of Aaron Paul . His turn as Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad was one of the most gut wrenching , heart pulling performances of all time , and any time I have the opportunity to see him do his thing on screen , I 'm going to be there . He was trying so hard with the material here , and despite the utter crap he 's got to say on screen , he still manages to pull it off . I have to tip my cap to Aaron Paul . Such a talented actor.3 . They let you play with iPads in military prison.If there 's one thing I learned from Need for Speed , it 's that they have spare laptops laying around in hospitals and iPads in the brig . At one point , a character is in a MILITARY PRISON , and casually asks a female guard ( who clearly is n't interested ) for an iPad to follow his buddy during an illegal race on what must be a cleverly designed app ( found easily on the App store , I 'm sure ) - either that or it 's just a website that anyone could hop onto and follow the race ( paying attention , cops ? ) . So what does she do ? She grabs an iPad from the ol ' Army surplus of iPads and connects to the Wi-Fi ( again , in military jail ) so that he can fist pump while his friend blows through traffic.4 . The racing scenes were awesome.The plot was so dumb , and makes absolutely no sense . However , if you 're going to see Need for Speed , you 're really going for two reasons - Aaron Paul and the car chases , and let me tell you ... the racing scenes delivered . The roar of the engine , the skidding of tires , the exotic cars , they all looked beautiful . They were shot amazingly and the lack of CGI really showed . There was a great amount of effort into making the car scenes as cool as they were , and it paid off . And that Mustang ... that Mustang ... it really made me miss mine.5 . This plot was so dumb , and makes absolutely no sense.Yeah , this is a car movie , but it 's still a movie , right ? Up until our hero gets out of prison , I was with this plot . Sure , the dialogue was hokey , and everyone on Aaron Paul 's racing team came across as if they wanted to date him , but I was with it . Then , it went completely off the rails . When he gets out of prison , his plan is to enter this super secret race to get revenge against Dominic Cooper 's villain character . Exactly how though ? At this point , he does n't even know if Cooper is in said race ( and actually , he was n't at that point ) . Somewhere in there , the villain also enters the race , because he runs a failing auto dealership and needs a few more cars ? Also , can we address the fact that Kid Cudi plays a pilot who can fly anything ... and does ? He randomly shows up in planes , news helicopters and at one point , an Apache , like he calmly goes to a rent-a-whateveryouneedforthisscene , and there he is , in the sky without difficulty . Or Michael Keaton 's character , who apparently puts this race on every year , who just broadcasts everything from his living room and is never caught ... because ... why ? This script really goes the extra 3,000 miles to insult the audience with stupidity.If you 're looking for a movie where you need to check your brain at the door ... or completely chuck it out of a McLaren going 200mph , this is the movie for you . My suggestion ? Wait until it hits Netflix and fast forward through the garbage that is n't car racing .	-1
Theatrical review . There may be spoilers.Scott Waugh brings the successful video game to the big screen . I expect the film be in the running for worst film of the year . I was lured in to see some cool cars ( especially the Shelby Mustang ) , some cool driving sequences and was n't expecting much else . There was one surprise . A pretty good soundtrack which for me was highlighted by Jamie Common 's version of Dylan 's `` All Along The Watchtower . '' So I was satisfied with my reason for going . But still , I love movies and was expecting something more than this claptrap.The so called plot consists of garage owner , Tobey Marshall ( Aaron Paul ) a wannabe race car driver agreeing to spruce up a Mustang owned by his high school nemesis , Dino Brewster ( Dominic Cooper ) . Dino has gotten hands on the Mustang being developed by Ford and Carroll Shelby that was n't finished after Shelby died . Once Tobey and his misfits of a crew fix up the car , they would get a quarter of the sales price , expected to be in the neighborhood of $ 3 million.In a just-for-fun match race between Tobey , Dino and a close friend ( Harrison Gilbertson ) of Tobey 's who also happens to be Dino 's girlfriend 's younger brother and she happens to be the former girlfriend ( Dakota Johnson ) of Tobey 's . Well , high speeds on city streets can be dangerous and you guessed it , something bad happens . This all leads to an eventual big-balls-takes-all-shootout in northern California and Tobey and his now sold Mustang 's new owner 's associate Julia ( Imogen Poots ) , now must cross country to get to the big 6 car race where the winner gets all the cars.This story is so full of holes it 's just absurd . About every 5 minutes something really dumb happens . Here 's an example . Since Tobey is behind schedule , he decides to gas up while on the fly . His compatriots are always nearby in a truck that somehow manages to keep up with the 230 mph Mustang . So this little bit of putting gas in the tank while flying down the freeway , is followed a few scenes later with them stopping to get gas and allow Julie to change clothes or something.If you must , see it for the cars ... and there are some beauties including a Bugatti , GTA Spano , Lamborghini Gallardo , Mercedes-Benz McLaren , McLaren P1 , etc . and some great stunt driving .	-1
The acting really needs work here ! That 's my # 1 criticism for this movie ! This movie does n't make me believe and if I do n't believe them , how in the world will I like it ? I wo n't . I just kept thinking , they 're not really playing their roles well . They did n't take me away from reality and the terrible poor acting.Okay , so what do I like in this movie . I liked the police car chases and the races with all the other sports cars . I also liked how they were great at trying to adapt the video elements into the movie . I feel they were heavily influenced by the `` Need For Speed Hot Pursuit series '' . And finally , I liked the hot main actress . That 's pretty much all I liked about the movie.I can tell you that this movie was better than `` Getaway , 2013 '' with Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez . That movie was just terrible , so give them a hand folks ? ! *Slow and quite clapping*Okay , so if you want to see a good racing movie though , you can watch Fast and the Furious 1 , 2 , or 3 . Do n't watch any other Fast and the Furious movie after 3 because those ARE NOT about racing.I thought this movie could had been the best , if they got better main actors and had a way better story . Forget the tragic lost of a friend and just keep the love story and rival plot . That would had make it slightly better . As for the main male actor , he really does n't know how to act ! It just got to distracting seeing him on the screen trying to become his character . He seemed too unstable with his emotions all the time . Every other min , happy , sad , depressed , basically all over the map . Throw that guy out ! Yes , I think you people should watch this movie , but no need to buy it . It 's not a keeper movie .	-1
Here 's the thing when you adapt a videogame to a movie : make sure the videogame has a plot , interesting characters , and a lot of fun ideas . Do n't pick a racing game . A racing game is cars driving . End of story . Even Space Invaders or Q-Bert or Duck Hunt have better source material for a movie.This is a waste of time . Bad acting . Bad writing . Nothing to care about . And I really do wish Aaron Paul well , after loving Breaking Bad so deeply . But this is a flop of flops. Wan na know what happens ? I 'll tell you : vroom , vroom , beep beep , screech , and people talking . That 's what this movie is.With some cool cars thrown into the mix.If you wan na see action with hot cars and driving stunts , even Expendables 2 is better than this . But all the Fast and Furious movies will do . All the James Bond movies will do -- especially the new ones.Or go & # 34 ; old school. & # 34 ; The Cannonball Run movies . Smokey and the Bandit movies . Dukes of Hazzard reruns . Knight Rider reruns . Trust me . All better than this movie.Only rent it for a dollar at a big metal box usually painted red . Or just avoid at all costs . Because , you 'll want your dollar back .	-1
A small fraction into this film , the heroine was numb and so was I . After a race-baiting if not racist-in-context threesome , the lovingly rendered scenes of bloody S & M ; , and escalating , I was expecting a beheading by the end of it all . It was worse . The two final confrontations were what led me to believe the film was against all that is good , or maybe just against all that is . The film delighted in erasing any positive sentiment it had accidentally cultivated -- or maybe it cultivated positive sentiments for the sole purpose of annihilating them.So our heroine -- or hero , since she calls her Joe and not Jo -- is against love ( stated in Volume I ) and against the sentimentality of motherhood ( stated in Volume II ) . I champion neither , but if the alternative is this ceaseless funfest , then love and motherhood start to look positively enlightened . I mean , come on , we all had the young adult ` this-can't-be-it ' moment , so when Joe deadpans : `` Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I 've always demanded more from the sunset . More spectacular colours when the sun hit the horizon . That 's perhaps my only sin . '' we can indulge her , until we realise she is completely serious , and humourless in general.Volume I gave us the fishing , maths and music analogies . Volume II has nowhere to go but religion , so we have Western ( Roman Catholic ) vs. Eastern ( Orthodox ) Churches and The Transfiguration . By this time , the analogies seem more compulsive and excessive than our nymphomaniac.Then Seligman says something to the effect ` Being anti-Zionist is not the same as being anti-Semitic , ' a completely unnecessary thing to say . And then Joe with her ` negro ' comment . That was part of what made me think the threesome was ... racial . She says all women fancy it , setting up black male sexuality , and then the outcome of the threesome , while not explicitly emasculating , was cutting . The scene itself is somewhat hilarious outside race , but in the context of her comments and the fact that the noted appearance of black people in the film is end-capped with buffoonery and bookmarked with a racial and sexual stereotype is suspect . I 'm not saying you can not have divisive characters in film . But perhaps Seligman and Joe exist to spout the same viewpoint : they simply divided the dialogue . Seligman got the analytical persona and Joe got the compulsive persona , but , in the end , over-analysis and compulsion are both ways to somewhat pompously distance yourself from other people and from life itself .	-1
Nymphomaniac : Volume 2 was not where as good as Volume 1 . It was cringe-worthy , not entertaining . See Nymphomaniac : Volume 1 , skip Nymphomaniac : Volume 2 .	-1
When all they do is make shows about politics it gets really boring really fast ! They need to focus on relationships more . The political agendas get pushed so hard it 's tedious to watch ! Also the guardian angel was a total joke ! They should have brought back Fred ! He was the best ! Her new angel was annoying and was always trying to get attention by not having clothes on , ok we get it already you think your hot get over yourself ! ! ! SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING ! ! !	-1
Maybe it 's the formula of every episode , or maybe it 's just that the show has gone on too long and has gotten tired -- whatever it is , I just do n't enjoy it like I did early on . I do continue to like & # 34 ; Jane & # 34 ; and I hope the actress finds another series where she can display her talents , but the other actors are only so-so . I would have given the first couple of seasons five stars .	-1
If you are totally ignorant of our history , then , perhaps , you will get an average start on learning some names , a bit of geography , and several significant dates . Other than that , it is no more than a story on par with & # 34 ; George Washington did not lie about chopping down a cherry tree & # 34 ; . Very childish .	-1
I had thought this would be a great story and series to watch . After watching the preview I have no interest in this show .	-1
Almost unwatchable ... there were 11 reloads in final 30 minutes ranging from 43 seconds to over a minute ( Yes- we started timing them ) . Too many copies were probably sold . It would have been better with commercials .	-1
DON DRAPER IS NOW A BORING CAD , PEGGY IS RIDICULOUS , DON 'S WIFE IS A CARTOON , BETTY IS A DRAG AND ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE DUMMIES . IT WAS NEVER A GREAT SHOW BUT NOW IT IS AS USELESS AS SCANDAL .	-1
This show is very tired , must finish watching but it is painful , Don Draper is pathetic and this thing is just dragging , his wife makes me cringe . His ex Bettie is a miserable mess , Roger and his antics are bizarre and yes boring , God let it be over	-1
Not sure why they opted for this & # 34 ; final & # 34 ; season . Writers must be burnt out . The 60 's fashion is fun to see , but not much else going on there as far as any interesting story line .	-1
I was excited about this series when it first aired . Then season 2 came along , and it was intriguing . But now it 's just ... silly ... and confusing . I think the writers see themselves as sort of William Gibson meets China Mielville or something . I 've watched three episodes in season three and think I 'll give up . It 's just too much work for the entertainment one receives .	-1
Seasons 1 and 2 were great . Not sure what went wrong but season 3 seems disjointed and the storyline was flat out boring . Definitely not worth the money for the season pass.It was so boring that I started to really notice things like how lousy of an actress Rachel Nichols is . She 's constantly ( and annoyingly ) moving her head left and right when she 's speaking and her & # 34 ; crying & # 34 ; is laughable . And she cries a lot in season 3 . And when she 's not crying she just makes that & # 34 ; I just sucked on a lemon & # 34 ; face . o.OLiber8 is reduced to scene fillers , Carlos just runs around making tough guy faces ( or is that constipation ) but other than that he does n't really do anything , and butt kicking Emily is nowhere to be found except for a few seconds of screen time where she just plays & # 34 ; the girlfriend & # 34 ; .Do yourself a favor and skip season 3 .	-1
Not very interesting	-1
I 've always liked this show , as it 's a no-frills forensics show which was around long before CSI ( a phony plastic rendition ) . It was some time before I noticed certain things about the show . The show has one focus ... murder of human beings . First , it is well-known that only ten percent of murders are solved , so this show give a false sense that perpetrators will ALWAYS be caught ( and that 's the way cop shops want the public to think i.e . they are doing their jobs ! ) . But what finally bothered me was that ALL the murderers portrayed were white males ! Statistically , all four races murder equally , other than blacks , who are more prolific depending on what town and state you 're in ! ( Look it up ! ) In addition , females murder at HIGHER percentage than males ( ~52 % ) , so murderers are NOT gender-specific ! So what does this mean ? If you show ONLY white males murdering and they are murdering mostly women ( already shown to be biased ) , then the assumption is that ONLY white males murder and this sets up a 'fear-base ' among populations and biases 'white males ' . This is called misinformation i.e . some parts are true and some not and is a form of propaganda . This show is produced by the J*wish New World Order , which has often proved a vendetta against this particular racial group ( white males ) . I got so tired of this biased viewpoint that I finally stopped watching altogether . You 've got to keep an eye on our corrupt media , as they constantly feed you lies and disinformation !	-1
Just not my type of show .	-1
Boring , slow , predictable , unsexy , unfunny . My wife and I did n't laugh once . POOR SCRIPT . Waste of the actor 's talent and our time .	-1
WALK OF SHAME is an aggressively formulaic comedy about a local news reporter named Meghan Miles . When her bid to anchor a national network is rejected , her friends take her out for a night on the town to get her mind off her problems . Unfortunately , after a very drunken one-night-stand , Meghan is informed that the network is willing to give her one more chance . Stranded by boozy circumstances without her purse , phone , or car , Meghan has eight hours to make her way through L.A. 's grimier districts and back to her place of business . This is less a walk of shame than it is a hasty dash with stolen bicycles and the occasional glimpse of meth.The movie is n't what I would call actively bad , but it is also pretty much a predictable comedic installment running through all of the same tired motions with the same stock characters . And , of course , the movie stretches credulity multiple times . Sometimes it 's a background thing : Meghan 's one night stand is with an impossibly good-looking bartender ( Jason Marsden ) whose open-plan , exposed-brick studio apartment would cost more than twenty L.A. bartenders could afford in a good month . Mostly , though , the incredulity is stretched at the expense of the movie 's main comedic crutch , which is that the mostly demure Meghan has borrowed her slutty friend 's sexy yellow dress and now everyone she encounters immediately assumes she 's a hooker . Cue : shenanigans as no one helps her.While most comedies like this rely a lot on hilarious misunderstandings , it takes some clever writing to make that misunderstanding seem believable , and here it simply does n't work . Or at least not consistently . Audiences are left to wonder why she does n't just speak up for herself while cops and bus drivers are reading her the riot act . You could argue that she 's trying to avoid being noticed as a local news anchor ( the network that 's considering her has made it clear that they want someone with a respectable , family-type image ) , but really , Meghan 's circumstances could be easily explained without salacious details . So , under this overriding conceit , she runs from horny cab drivers , runs through traffic , gets involved in gang shootouts , and becomes something of a news item herself.I considered the film a three-star movie up until the final five or ten minutes , when our conclusion turned into moralizing . I do n't know why comedies feel like they have to have some kind of lesson or message in them . Is n't it enough to make people laugh ? Anyway , while the movie was mildly amusing in a forgettable way , it took a turn for the worse at the end when Meghan decided to turn her walk of shame into one of pride , and the scriptwriter decided to shoehorn a weird , clunky sermon about being yourself and judging others . The moment feels forced and preachy and vaguely off-putting . Much in the same way that the people Meghan encounters are constantly chastising her for looking as skinny and tawdry as a meth-addicted hooker , while that -- I 'm sure -- is what the producers were hoping would be a big drawing point for audiences . With apologies to Elizabeth Banks , who I think is both beautiful and talented and who does a stand-up job here in spite of the material.Mostly forgettable when it is n't annoyingly pounding the pulpit , this is yet another cookie-cutter comedy from the Hollywood treadmill .	-1
The makers of this should be ashamed . For a story line that could have been really funny , it turned out to be boring .	-1
Where to even begin with this ? For starters , I guess I could say that while it is nice that females are getting leads in comedies , it is sad that Elizabeth Banks , quite a talented actress , is saddled with this kind of unfunny crap . There were some funny moments , like the opening credits , but it was all downhill from there . The plot has the thinnest of conceits : a local news anchor loses out on a job offer , and goes partying with her girlfriends . Afterwards , she meets a guy who she goes home with and after waking up , she begins her & # 34 ; walk of shame & # 34 ; to try and get back to her job on time . Having such a thin story acts as a double-edged sword . It means we are n't saddled with a lot of narrative detours , but it also means that there really is n't much time for character development . And once the plot kicks in , it 's just a series of comic set-pieces , a few of which work , but most of which do n't . Oftentimes , the humor they were going for was too awkward and bordered on creepy . They also gave away a lot of the best jokes in the trailer . At the end they try to make up for all of it by having Elizabeth Banks ' character give a speech about how it 's wrong to assume a girl is a whore based on what she wears . Still , it was n't enough to erase 80 minutes of racial stereotypes and misogyny ( as well as some momentary gay stereotypes ) . Overall , this movie was about as clich & eacute ; as you can get . It was largely devoid of laughs , which is very bad for a supposed & # 34 ; comedy. & # 34 ; No need to shame yourself by watching this garbage , even for the few laughs it did provide .	-1
This is a weak comedy that finds itself funny in many scenes while you watch uncomfortably , waiting for real laughs to come . They rarely , if ever , do.Then it -- of course -- bores us to oppression with the obligatory love interest subplot.Elizabeth Banks is capable of so much more as a comedic actress . This movie wasted her talents by refusing to write funny dialogue or intensely uncomfortable scenes , and failing to include any funny side characters for her to bounce off of.Most of the scenes seem like unfinished rehearsals , in which the funny parts have not been discovered or written yet . But they filmed it all anyway and called it a movie.TERRIBLE .	-1
I was unable to look mat it as it kept popping out . It is not possible to rate this video .	-1
Well , Minnie Driver was my main reason for watching this and she was only in it for , like , the blink of an eye . I love smart teen horror movies , but this is not one . The songs are uninspired . Skip it .	-1
Ya this movie started off ok but then slowly declined into a crappy horror movie with some music thrown in . Pretty much the same songs are just used over and over again throughout the movie and are not clever at all . Acting is ok but nothing special . The killer was kinda cool but even that annoying after awhile . I would n't recommend this at all .	-1
Odd mixture of Glee and slasher film has a few laughs , some decent gore and a lot of musical numbers . Stage Fright has a fantastic trailer but the movie itself is n't nearly as good . The problem is that Stage Fright wants to be a horror comedy but it is n't funny enough consistently to work as a comedy and there are too few suspense scenes for it to work as a horror film -- the horror elements are pretty much concentrated at the beginning and end of the film and mostly ignored in the middle . That leaves the singing and dancing . The songs are n't bad and a couple of the musical sequences are even fairly clever , but the various elements Stage Fright is trying to juggle never really end up meshing all that well . This might be worth a look if the idea of a slasher comedy with musical numbers appeals to you , but in the end Stage Fright is an ambitious failure .	-1
& # 34 ; Morris also creates commercials to support liberal candidates and causes . & # 34 ; About.com biography . Just another Michael Moore that is trying to paint a picture of Republicans as evil boogey men . I turned off after about half since it is obviously not an impartial evaluation of Donald Rumsfeld . I am not a Bush fan but all the five stars above must be Obama voters getting just what they expected from this guy .	-1
I 'm a huge Errol Morris fan . Making good documentaries takes serious courage but when the subject of your film is an infamous question dodger you better be prepared to ask tough questions and push him for real answers . This film leads you do n't a rabbit hole to nowhere . I 'm pissed that Morris allows Rumsfeld to smile mockingly at the camera for an hour and say absolutely nothing of consequence . I rented a curtain reveal but instead of a brand new car I wound up with the 1970 's vacuum . Thanks a lot Jim .	-1
To begin , I 'm not the biggest `` alien '' fan . However , I absolutely love the `` found footage '' genre of films and will take a chance on pretty much any I come across . Let me be clear , the problem with this movie IS N'T in the production , acting , sound , or anything of that nature . The problem I had with the film was the fact that I just did n't find it all that interesting . Honestly , I 'm not 100 % sure what could have been done to remedy this problem ? The entire movie is based on `` found footage '' recorded by the youngest member of the Morris family , Riley ( Riley Polanski ) . Riley suffers from a form of autism and the video camcorder helps him cope with the world around him . It 's a pretty straight forward ride here.The Morris family is on vacation and decides to take a trip to Brown Mountain in North Carolina . While camping one night , Riley is awaken by strange lights . He wakes his brother , Corey ( Corey Eid ) and sister , Jillian ( Jillain Clare ) to inspect what he is looking at . Three lights appear in the sky overhead and quickly shoot out of sight . This is apparently an ongoing phenomenon that occurs in North Carolina and is simply known as the Brown Mountain Lights.Riley continues to film the vacation and eventually the family gets lost in twisty mountain roads . When they come upon a tunnel , they discover numerous cars that have been vacated suddenly and are blocking the road ahead . When their dad , Peter ( Peter Holden ) gets out to inspect , the 3 guys head inside while Jillian and her mom , Katie ( Katherine Sigismund ) go for a bathroom break . While inside the tunnel the 3 come face to face with the problem.From here on out , it 's basically footage of Riley and family rushing around and LOTS of super bright , blue lights shining through a variety of objects . There is around 5 minutes of actual `` alien '' shots and about 1 minute of the `` abduction '' . Just seemed to me that I spent 95 % of the movie WAITING for something to happen and when it finally did , it was over.Final Verdict : PASS !

This movie captures a good idea , but does so very poorly . There are a couple good scenes here but they are largely outweighed by the bad and the very bad . I give this two disfigured alien thumbs down.This found footage film opens with the following caption : & # 34 ; The following is actual leaked footage from the US Air Force. & # 34 ; It 's cute when obviously untrue stories masquerade as true stories just to add mood or generate buzz . The Fourth Kind ( 2009 ) had people rushing to Google to check stats of people disappearing and FBI investigations in Gnome , Alaska . They did it well . Although that was about all they did well. & # 34 ; For centuries , people have been disappearing on and around Brown Mountain , North Carolina . Locals believe the disappearances are directly linked with sightings of THE BROWN MOUNTAIN LIGHTS. & # 34 ; News casts , accounts from locals and witnesses , and testimonials from paranormal experts follow . These segments represent one of few things that were done well in this movie.A family goes on a camping trip in the Brown Mountains . The parents and kids are somewhat likable , normal people and their trip is filmed by their youngest son . On their first night , the kids see lights in the sky moving in a way no star possibly could.The acting is far from top notch . When the father gets them lost and loses his temper his behavior is totally unfounded . When they run out of gas ( which I do n't see happening on a family road trip into the mountains ) the family tension escalates and the father becomes rage-y , again unconvincingly . Then again , even if they nailed their lines , the writing was n't great either . They come by several abandoned minivans and SUVs & # 8230 ; as if some camping family Rapture had taken them all , leaving their cars and camping gear behind like a scene from The Walking Dead but without the walkers or corpses.We come across all the standard alien invasion film tropes . Birds becomes disoriented and fly into things creating jump scares , obscured film of extra terrestrial figures in the darkness , lights in the sky , satellite interference , alien mind control telepathy attacks a la Independence Day ( 1996 ) , aliens examining humans , tractor beams , monstrous alien sounds & # 8230 ; you name it , these filmmakers borrowed it . Almost none of this is executed well . But there is one really cool , brief scene in the entire movie when a tractor beam gets someone , cracking and contorting their body while being levitated.The aliens follow the most simple of paradigms . They 're tall , lanky , grey-skinned , big-eyed , four-fingered extra terrestrials that sound , at times , like the Predator ( 1987 ) mating with a velociraptor while slitting a pig 's throat . Later we hear them communicate with the bubbly blip sounds from Signs ( 2002 ) .First-time director Matty Beckerman does a hardly serviceable job delivering an entertaining movie . The biggest faults are clearly found in the writing ( also done by a first-time writer ) and acting , especially the loner mountain man the family encounters -- worst performance in the movie by far . There are some pacing issues as well , with some seriously dull lulls between periods of action . This movie actually goes from okay , to bad as we transition from the first act . It just seems to get worse and worse and the film wears on.Maybe I 'd take a chance at whatever this director does next , but I wo n't get my hopes up . At one point in the movie the mother describes Brown Mountain saying & # 34 ; It 's like Deliverance , minus the anal rape. & # 34 ; As far as my enjoyment of this movie goes & # 8230 ; well & # 8230 ; it 's like Deliverance , with the anal rape . There were short segments of this film that were done well , but too much was poorly for me to recommend this to anyone .	-1
Great . Another silly movie from a hand held camera . Was n't that played out with Blair Witch ? Guess what ? Aliens on the attack in North Carolina . No , not the aliens that have taken over the NC state legislature . They 're in the mountains . If you plan on watching this dreck , make it a party game . Count the number of obvious plot holes . Here we go kiddies . A family decides to go camping on the mountain . All this is being shown from the camera of the autistic son . The first night the kids see strange lights in the sky that suddenly take off in multiple directions . The kids tell the parents , who do n't believe them . The kids do n't show them the video . Day 2 , the parents go to camp site number 2 . The GPS stops working and the father gets lost and ... you guessed it ... they run low on gas . Suddenly they come to a section of road built inside the mountain . Cars are blocking it and no one is in the cars . Dad , son # 1 , and the camera kid decide to investigate . Despite seeing no one in multiple cars , including a cop car , they trudge on through the mountain road expecting , well , what ? Then they see something . It comes towards them and ... gasp ! ... it 's the alien on the cover . Everyone runs . But Dad is & # 34 ; abducted & # 34 ; ? Son # 1 gets the family into the car and races to a house they saw along the way . Queue & # 34 ; Deliverance & # 34 ; . They run across Jed Clampett . Not really , but mountain man allows them shelter and guns , while the daughter just freaks out . The aliens attack and one by one ... well , lets not give away too much of the plot . If you decide to let Amazon abduct your money , make sure you watch the end credits , because ... just watch . It really does seem like this could be a decent movie , but are n't you sick and tired of having to watch jerky film movements that no one in their right mind would film if they were really being chased by ET ? And movies that have no real ending ? If you must watch something like this , I 'd suggest the better Area 407 movie . It 's silly too , but it has a satisfying ending .	-1
The premise is n't bad . It could have been a good movie , unfortunately it was n't . I wish someone would understand that the POV of the camera does n't have to be the whole movie . They could do traditional and POV and have it make more sense . I mean ... come on ... when you are running for your life you are n't going to be running with the camera eye level.So Daddy gets & # 34 ; taken & # 34 ; and the close knit family seems to deal with it really really well . I mean , if my dog was & # 34 ; taken & # 34 ; I would be upset and mad and it would be for the whole time ... .not just the first hour.Then there is the autistic kid . Um ... if they did n't say he was , you would never know.Finally the hillbilly red neck mountain man . Someone took every stereotype and made a character out of him just to have someone narrate the & # 34 ; situation & # 34 ; that they are in . Like a good ol ' hunter.MY ADVICE ... DO N'T RENT IT . Wait for it to come on TV at 2am .	-1
The premise is that an autistic boy films everything as part of his condition . I feel like this is downright offensive , and that 's only where the movie begins.It does some things which are good , like show you the hint of a creature in reflection or a shadow moving on the corner of the frame , but then it just sticks the creature there in front of you , relying on camera shake and vertigo to obscure it.Things like this make me want to go into movie making , because if these idiots can get a movie to market , anyone can .	-1
It seems like the more companies Disney takes over the worse they become . They now own Pixar , Lucas films , The Muppets and Marvel . And they have ruined all of these franchises . The last few muppets movies were horrible . The las few marvel movies were horrible . And the last few Pixar movie have been terrible as well . This movie is no exception It has average repetitive action scenes and predictable plot . would not recommend .	-1
Just a dumb movie . I have no idea what made me want to rent this , I just wasted $ 4 . Not Amazon 's fault , just mine for hitting the confirm button .	-1
Well , I wish I could recite the plot or give the prospective audience a review of exactly what this film is about and what I disliked and liked about it but I ca n't make myself write an intelligent commentary basically for the simple reason that there is n't any thoughtful remarks to be made when it comes to rating this movie.I 'll try to summarise what I understood so far , a bunch of superficial men and women are introduced and they talk about their boring uninteresting lives as well as sexcapades . I just yawned the entire time , this is exactly what the media is trying to brain wash people into being nowadays ; mindless , self entitled , unambitious dumb heads who will chase the first trend they see.Ugh , I could n't even finish it skip this mediocre stupid movie and watch something else more meaningful . Whoever made this mess should be ashamed of themselves .	-1
This is a young adult sex romp comedy , or at least tries to be funny . Cameron ( Virginia Williams ) and her husband ( Jesse Bradford ) have an open marriage . They attempt to convince Owen ( Bryan Callen ) and Kate ( Tammin Sursok ) they should try it . Through a series of circumstances they all end up at a Hampton house complete with a young naked man , two girls from Craig 's List , a Brazilian bombshell , and a decorator.While this is going on they try to hide it from a visiting author the guys want to sign . Confusion mounts as signs of infidelity are all around.The film was n't funny . It took a standard formula and ruined it with a bad plot and idiotic dialogue . They just put one stupid thing on top of another without thinking if it was funny or not . It started out with promise and then fizzled fast.Not recommended even as a rental.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex , nudity .	-1
It was filmed in the dark , which for me I find almost impossible to watch because you ca n't see anything . That would eliminate the cost of props or settings perhaps ? Just a thought because thats all I can think about during episode 2 , I 'm in the dark . Why are we in the dark ? I set the brightness on my Mac to the brightest setting . This combined with the poorly scripted , so boring episode makes not even want to finish episode 2 .	-1
This stinkeroo is so blatantly bad it will make your teeth hurt.It is incredibly disrespectful to women . It makes no attempt to be historically accurate . WGN should be ashamed to be associated with this project !	-1
Following hot on the heels of FOX 's runaway success `` Sleepy Hollow '' , WGN throws their hat in the ring of prime-time television with a blunt attempt at a more `` adult '' revisiting of New England 's spooky lore.Unfortunately , `` Salem '' is historical revisionist drama by the numbers demonstrating a complete cultural and ideological disconnect to the period setting , featuring lurid thrills and a shallow undercurrent of eroticism where viewers are treated to a cast of hygienically challenged men , sexually repressed and typically hot women all set in an anachronistic , neo-Wiccan/Puritan dichotomy.For the record I love the horror genre ( look at my review page if you 're in doubt ) , but when it comes to unsympathetic or moronically inaccurate fiction that portrays a historical figure such as Cotton Mather ( who graduated from Harvard at the age of 15 , was a gifted preacher , theologian , historian and scholar of ancient languages , active in philanthropy ranging from the education of former slaves to pensions for retired clergy , a prolific author whose extant works are still considered examples of classic American literature and was not known to have attended a single witch trial ) as an ignorant and bigoted zealot who spends his days behind a pulpit and his evenings at the local brothel is to me inexcusable and demonstrates more contempt than artistic license.Contempt seems to be a primary motivation behind the writing for this series best exemplified by the central character John Alden ( think Hugh Jackman from `` Van Helsing '' ) who in an impassioned speech at a bloody trial , declares the citizens of Salem to be `` murdering , hypocritical , Puritan bastards '' thus giving modern audiences the opportunity to engage in something C.S . Lewis called chronological snobbery while simultaneously summarizing what little subtext this show possesses . `` Salem '' : intellectually shallow but heavy on gore and sex ... . sounds like a recipe for success . : o )	-1
The hyped-up description of this mess is empty and unfulfilled . What is delivered is unexplained weirdness which you patiently sit through because you can not believe there will be NOTHING delivered in the end . If Ms. Johansson makes a couple more films like this , no one will again trust a film is good just because she is in it .	-1
This is the strangest movie I watched in some time . Scarlett Johansen has very little dialogue , she seems to stumble through and does not demonstrate her acting chops . I would not recommend this movie at all .	-1
I do n't know of any heterosexual man who is not a Scarlett Johansson fan , but I could be wrong . This may be rare , but I buy/watch movies based on the actors/actresses rather than the plot . Obviously , it 's hit or miss since not all can be blockbusters . This one was definitely a miss . As some posters have already mentioned , there is very little dialogue , a whole lot of SJ looking blankly into space , heavy Scottish accents , and unfortunately a lot of nude men scenes . The only consolation was that SJ displayed herself in all her glory in a few scenes . I understand that the female alien role , that SJ played , had a self awareness awakening towards the end , but the journey getting there was excruciating and the ending landed with a dull thud.I must add that the Scottish landscapes and other scenes of life in the UK were spot on . I lived in the UK for 5 years and it brought back many memories of the mostly dismal weather and the Mom and Pop grocery stores complete with bland food - God Bless America ! Unfortunately , I 'm not an indie movie fan and can not recommend this movie even for rental . If I could rate this movie with half a star , I would . Save your money .	-1
I waited eagerly for this film to come out . The book was fabulous on so many levels . It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women , women and women , and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end . Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing . What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space , with and without clothes . Seriously , that is a major part of the film . This film goes beyond slow to tedious . The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I 'd read would suddenly burst forth ... it never happened . You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson . In the book , Isserley was not a beautiful woman , having been ( painfully ) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth . That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable . They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone . The objectification of women was a large part of the story . Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment . Her alien insights were intriguing , something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end , what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI . A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets . Forget this one ... I already have .	-1
Do not waste your money on this Movie , it 's below 1 star . Just because Scarlett Johansson is a hot chick , do n't be a fool Like me . It should be called Under One Star . If you get sucked in and watch I warned you , Save Your Money for Blockbusters , This movie is Crap.Sincerely Edgar	-1
Horrible , terribad , worthless . Do not waste your time . This is a disjointed , awful , attempt at some type of & # 34 ; artsy & # 34 ; statement . Watch at your own risk and waste of money .	-1
( Do n't think so but could be a spoiler ) I read the reviews and could n't believe the movie was that bad I did n't rent I paid for for the blu-ray , I would say bad mistake but yet I 'm glad I did , the reason Scarlett Johansson in front of a full body mirror only in her birthday suit . The movie itself was crap , the story went nowhere fast , nothing explained at the beginning why they were here . If they were going to take over the human race , they sucked at it . They had no superpower no tect , her only job was to pickup men , as good looking as she is , had a hard time doing that . If you are a Johansson fan Buy do n't rent . If not you ca n't say the one stars did n't try to tell you .	-1
Is it even possible to adequately articulate why a movie that ( briefly ) features ScarJo nude in all her magnificent glory rates only one star ? I read the novel by Michael Faber , and it is the only horror story that I 've ever read that literally made my skin crawl . The movie aspires to be as literate and artistic as the novel but only manages a silly pretentiousness . The film starts out with 5 minutes of utter darkness followed by a bright light shown directly in the viewers eye that slowly resolves itself into a headlight ; yep , somebody just graduated from film school . Get used to that blackness by the way ; 80 % of the movie is filmed in a shadowy darkness so that the actors are barely visible . It is the worst cinematography I have ever seen in a film that features an A-List Hollywood star ( look at the shadowy image of Johansson 's face on the box cover : that 's exactly what the movie looks like ) . I know ScarJo relocated to France to be with her new husband , a bonanza for European film makers , but if she keeps making these cheaply produced European films , she wo n't be an A-List actor for much longer.The plot is pretty straightforward and can be reduced to a single sentence : an alien is surgically reconstructed to appear to be an alluring human female who entices men to the aliens ' feeding pens . But you will NEVER figure this out by watching the movie . There is almost no dialogue ( a crime when one considers the literacy of the source material ) , and then it is spoken in an impenetrable Scottish brogue so thick you will need to read captions if you want to know what they are saying.If you are a fan of Michael Fabers ' novels , do not watch this movie ; his writing is like a swift flowing stream that captures you and carries you along , but this movie is the dam on that stream .	-1
I loved the book , which is beautifully written and a thoughtful study of food , consumption , and humanity . The film is stunning in its photography and the music is very eerie . Sadly , they did not maintain the major plot elements of the book which would have made the film more meaningful and profound . Or they might have vaguely implied it , but images were not enough . We needed a voiceover or some narrative to give the audience more of an idea of what is going on in the lair .	-1
