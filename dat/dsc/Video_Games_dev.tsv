The monsters have the best detail ever , they die more easily at this beginning levels , easier to aim , huge single man fights I actually won with a few tries I 'm no Rad Brad the King : ) , It 's bright enough unlike ODST where everything is too dark and it ruins the game . It 's playable unlike odst which sucks . I really like it so far and recommend this to any reach , or halo fan .	1
Best Halo yet . Graphics are really spectacular and it is fun to play . Certainly not a believable plot , but entertaining none the less . I would highly recommend this game to Halo fans as well as newbies .	1
I like this game a lot . It is a fantastic addition to the franchise . I like that they went with 2 discs instead of scaling back the story or graphics .	1
I was part of the vocal minority that spoke out against the decisions that 343i were making in regards to Halo 4 's multiplayer ... I saw myself as a classical Halo truist , and did n't feel comfortable seeing the beloved game I grew up playing stray from the tried and true formula that Bungie has created a decade prior . I was even a fan of Reach , having little over a month 's worth of playing time just in multiplayer alone , I saw myself siding with Halo 's original studio and developer and following whatever decision they ended up making as a result.So when I finally gotten around to getting the game a month after it came out , I had entered the campaign with high hopes , but I already had my mind made up about the online component . I think my personal opinion was swayed by the plethora of online discussions and arguments over Halo somehow turning into a call of duty-esque experience and how 343i were lacking any creative liberties , and were instead following what was apparently the industry standard in game design . While there 's some parallels with what has been said and done , I feel like in my mind that this game does in fact create a sand box in which grants players a new way to experience and participate in Halo in a new and creative way that is not only exclusive to Halo but perhaps in gaming in general.It was n't until AFTER I have unlocked all the loadout weapons and options that I have started to discover what makes this game so great ... everything has a counter and nothing should be taken for granted , and the best part is that the community is given the room and chance to evolve their tactics to fit the environment that the players ultimately create in the game . How the game will be played a year from now will be drastically different then how it 's generally played today ... the fact that Halo 4 has these hidden possibilities and opportunities waiting for the player to take advantage of suggests that Halo may still be on the cusp of being the industry leader in online multiplayer design . That is of course the developer fails to see what potential lies in this direction and instead opts for a more conventional and streamlined approach.A lot of fans are making a ruckus about being able to create ` load outs ' and that there are certain weapons that are more efficient in taking out opponents over the other , while these complaints do raise valid questions and concerns ... one would need to delve in the mechanics of the game and dissect the game on a technical level before making such conclusions . With each weapon I have found there is a reasonable counter , and how these weapons interact with each other may not be so obvious or apparent to the typical gamer who are not as discerning in how the game is set up . As of right now I feel that the options are moderately weighted in congruence with each other and that one particular tool or option carries enough importance to consider being used without completely making other counterparts seem unnecessary.And perhaps that 's why I 'm having fun with this game , I like seeing how different options render different results ... and how that the game caters almost meticulously to specific playing style . However , I must admit that the latest Call of Duty offers more options and more freedom on how a player goes about playing , but I honestly ca n't play that game without wanting to put in Halo 4 instead ... unless it 's zombies , I like zombies.So all in all ... I love this game .	1
Graphics are amazing . Story is well constructed and the online play is fun . Playing with friends and talking trash through the online feature made this game more worth . Extremely fun and love the leveling up system in mulitplayer and the availability of spartan ops missions .	1
I think that 343 has done a great job with picking up Halo . The story seemed to me to be more skillfully told and the online multiplayer is great . The Rocket Race game mode they have I have spent countless hours playing that with friends ! 343 really took this franchise in stride and overall made a fun game you can enjoy playing by yourself or with friends . Hopefully they keep improving the fun online co-op modes .	1
The game looks awesome in every department ! The visuals and art style is flawless the story is finally fleshed out enough to get you care and game play is better then its ever been ! Granted this game was already superb and the improvement is not ground breaking its still no wonder this shooter is the standard !	1
Just as many have reviewers have stated , the game looks beautiful . I was blown away by the sheer aesthetically pleasing graphics and scenery . I do n't know if there is any game that can rival this one in terms of graphics . The story is alright , but just as many reviewers have stated , it is kind of hard to follow along if you do n't know everything there is to know about the Halo Universe . Another thing that caught my attention was the sound of the weapons particularly , the assault rifle . The sound really stuns your ears ! You have to hear it to believe it . Many things have changed from the other Halo titles . According to my knowledge , armor lock no longer exists . Instead , you can now use a power shield to temporarily deflect enemy fire . However , this does n't prevent you from getting run over by a ghost ! You even can use & # 34 ; promethean vision & # 34 ; which allows you to kind of see through walls to find your target . The music is different from the other Halo titles , but I personally think its beautiful . Anyways , I 've only listed a few of the peculiarities of this game . There are tons more . Great job 343 .	1
played through campaign , stunning visuals . epic story , ( make sure you get the terminals to see the videos ) . just played through spartan ops ep 1 , i cant believe these are free it is a great add on . keeps the story going	1
For me the best Halo ! ! ! I love it and with the War Games Map Pass it goes to an amazing new level this game is truly well done ! ! Amazing work of the 343 Industries guys !	1
Halo 4 is a great installment in the Halo franchise . The campaign is great and challenging , and the multiplayer is even better . The multiplayer environment has its bugs ( as to be expected from such a big game ) like dropping or freezing during a match , but it is n't frequent enough that it is a huge deal . My favorite feature by far is the Spartan Ops feature . This feature runs you through additional gameplay and storylines while set in the multiplayer environment , i.e . respawning after a time limit and allowing you to change your load outs after deaths . The best part is that you can increase or decrease the difficulty level , all while gaining XP points to add to your multiplayer profile . Overall , I 'd say this would be one of my favorite Halo games for Xbox 360 , I would recommend this to anybody .	1
my sexy man loved his Christmas gift . Now I watch him play all the games he got for Christmas last year .	1
It 's Halo . It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo.It 's Halo . 'Nuf said.Actually , 343 did an awesome job better balancing the game . More realistic without performance decrease as well . ( although I slightly miss the cartoonish Halo 's )	1
343 Industries has more than lived up to the expectations of Halo fans with this latest game . Story , graphics , and controls all exceed expectations and excel for a fantastic gaming experience . The balance of single and multi player stands out in particular and makes this one of the greatest , if not THE greatest , games of 2012 .	1
Awesome game for battling my friends or other people online . I always get into great competitions with this game ! ! Thank you ! !	1
game is great if your a halo fan this is a must have . . . . . . . .	1
I 've been a longtime fan of Halo ( Halo 2 being my favorite of the trilogy , until now ) . Needless to say , after seeing the announcement of Halo 4 at E3 2011 and helping put on an event during E3 2012 for Halo 4 , I was more than a little excited to say the least for the game . That , and nervous as many Halo fanatics were after Bungie left Microsoft to pursue other ventures and 343 Industries took over . Is Halo 4 a dud ? Certainly not . In actuality , it 's one of the best games in the series ( again , the story line of Halo 2 is so nostalgic it 's hard to surpass ) , if not the best thus far . Graphics are terrific , the voice acting is the best of any of the series thus far ( Cortana shows emotion this time around , something she lacked in my opinion except for sounding ever much like a `` sidekick '' ) and the story delves into the emotional side of Master Chief and Cortana . Did I get a little teary eyed at the end ? Oh yeah , and I 'm not afraid to admit it . Halo 4 possesses everything that made Halo , well , Halo in the first place , but 343 took it and ran with it even further , becoming much more serious and dark in nature . In the end , it 's arguably the best game in the Halo series and promises much for the future . In two words : GET IT .	1
Campaign is epic , multiplayer is fun and Spartan ops is awesome , excellent game for any halo franchise lover . It 's a must have	1
AMAZING GAME ! ! 10 outta 10 ... will make you forget about Halo Reach : ) Graphics are STUNNING ! ! ! Although environments are huge , I never found myself lost in the game , even though I frequently did n't have a beacon pointing me where to go next . Fights with the Prometheans were also varied enough that you could approach enemies from a number of different angles and entry points unlike a typical FPS.I focused on the single-player campaign mostly , but there 's a healthy amount of multiplayer for other `` hardcore '' gamers . There 's Spartan Ops which takes place after the Halo 4 campaign and allows you to play as UNSC Infinity crewmembers or part of a Spartans squad called Majestic Squad . It 's episodic and free . In addition , Forge ( BEST MAP EDITING ON ANY GAME ) returns so you can design your own multiplayer maps.You can also play the entire campaign mode cooperatively with up to three other players , though oddly , everyone plays as Master Chief . ( I mean ... I guess that sort of makes sense . Who would n't want to be Chief ? It 'll probably saves friends from fighting with each other ... ..lol ) The love that Chief and Cortana have for each other as true friends is strong in Halo 4 and helps in service to what is surprisingly an emotionally strong game . There 's lots of `` the 's '' thrown around over the course of the story as in we have to stop The Blank from accessing The Other Blank ... but put all of that aside , and the story of this friendship that knows no bounds is exceptionally told and emotionally earned.There 's also love for the source material by developer 343 Industries that is quite evident . Franchise fans will see how they tried to echo previous games as well as ensure their story tied into the one Bungie told . It was a tough mission but one they accomplished.Easily should win game of the year IMO	1
This item arrived early , which thrilled our grandson , as he was really looking forward to receiving this game . Absolutely perfect and it was early . Would definitely order from them again .	1
I played the first Halo game in 2001 . The campaign was longer . The enemies were more developed . They were led by religious zealotry and hatred of the enemies . They were fighting for control of Installation 04 . Some of the levels were larger , like the Library and the Assault on the Control Room . In the latter , there was more than one path to follow . I remember a snowy plain where you had to get to a Banshee . Between you and the Banshee , there was a large number of Covenant personnel and vehicles . The player could do a frontal attack or take a flanking path to the Banshee . Legendary was hard because the enemies were smarter and more dangerous . The character 's health was dependent on health packs . The character was , also , protected by a shield . Multiplayer was an option on this game . The backstory on this game was later presented in novels , which not required , did give the player more information on this universe.Eleven years later , the face of FPS shooters has changed . The campaign is shorter . The enemies are generic mindless killing devices . They have one purpose in life - to stop the player from reaching or accomplishing an objective . There is no backstory , because the developers expect the player to bone up on the books , the comics , the webisode , and whatever else there is . if the player does n't have the interest or the money to pay for these items , they are left in the cold as to what is happening . As much as this is an attempt to get the player invested in the series , it 's a marketing ploy to get more money from the fanbase . The levels are shorter . After having played through the eight levels , I have n't come upon an level as complex and challenging as the Assault on the Control Tower . Mostly , the player is defending an area , pushing a button , or putting in or taking Cortana out . The Master Chief has a replenishing health bar . In this game , the shield is a short-lived hardshell that is carried by the chief . It 's equivalent to the shields wielded by the Jackals . There are other devices that the chief can use - a thruster pack , a jet pack , a sentinel turret , an invisibility cloak , and a heat sensor . For me , other than the sentinel turret , these devices were gimmicks . During the game , the jet pack was truly useful in only one scenario . Having played Mass Effect as a engineer , I am comfortable with having a turret covering my back . There are some weird design flaws in the game . You can use a laser designator to take out an objective , but you ca n't use it on something that is n't an objective.Vehicle combat has been a mainstay of this series since the beginning . In this game , the player can take control of a Warthog , a Scorpion , a Mongoose , a Broadsword , a Ghost , a Banshee , or the Mantis . The controls are good , but the areas that the vehicles are driven on are small , and this smallness can create a challenge when driving a vehicle . Vehicles are great in large areas . They were great in the first game because many of the vehicular areas were large . My favorite vehicle in the series is the Mantis . It 's a well designed Mech , and for me , is the first Mech , where the cockpit can be rotated 360 degrees . I noticed an interesting design flaw ; in the first game , a player could fire on a Banshee from a ranged weapon and do damage . In this game , when I attempt to do the same , my weapons have no effect on the Banshee . I attempted this three times , with the same result.Weapons come in three categories : the UNSC , the Covenant faction , and the Prometheans . I have often found myself running out of ammo on these weapons , and being told that I needed to scavenge a weapon on the battlefield . I did n't need this announcement ; I am not blind to the fact that I have run out of ammo . I do n't know for sure if running out of ammo is because I am a poor shot , or there is a lack of ammo in this game . I did think often , that the enemies were bullet sponges.There are seven types of enemies , four Covenant and three Promethean . The Sentinels are not enemies , and appear infrequently in this game . The Covenant are the same from the types from the first game . The Elite did feel to me that they were easier to kill . I am confused about the Prometheans Knights - they were humans who were turned into data streams . How does someone turn a being of matter into a being of data ? The best I can determine about the Prometheans and the Covenant fanatics is that they are the henchman of the Didact.Now , the Didact . He is an ancient Forerunner who was imprisoned by the Librarian , another forerunner . Apparently , he had a beef against Humans , and is now set on destroying them . I think he would fit very well into Bond films . His backstory and motivation are n't as important as that he presents a threat to the protagonist . I did grow tired of his ramblings . He is the type of villain who loves monologues and taunting the protagonist . He demonstrates his hatred of Humans in a brutal scene that may frighten the little ones.The Master Chief is altered by the Librarian . This change is not explained in the story ; the only thing that is learned is that his bioreadings have changed and he can survive the Didact 's attack.A major plot point is that Cortana is rampaging . I feel that her rampages are acting as a plot device to move the plot forward ; I do n't feel that her disintegration is handled well . The Master Chief is constantly assuring her that she will be fine and that they will find Dr. Halsey . Apparently , Cortana is made from genetic material taken from Dr. Halsey and the only way to restore Cortana is to get more genetic material from Dr. Halsey . I have seen this plot thread before in Star Trek ; in one episode , a woman is aged by a virus to an old age , and the only way to restore her youth is by entering genetic material into a transporter , than transporting that woman again . It does n't make sense to me ; an AI is a data stream . Yet here she is treated like a being of matter who has a virus and is aging herself to death . Do the writers understand what matter is and what a data stream is ? Its errors like this that plaque the story , and make it incomprehensible.The allies are canon fodder . I did encounter an unusual situation . During one level , a friendly Warthog began firing on my Scorpion . Though the reticule showed the vehicle as green , it was firing at me . I returned fire and destroyed the vehicle , There was no reaction from the friendly AIs on the tank ; in the past , there would have been a comment or two about me taking out a friendly . I did find in one scene that the commanding officer of Infinity acted unprofessionally , and I found this scene disconcerting . This is when he demands Cortana to be deactivated.The background chatter present in the first game is less in this game.There are sound issues in this game . I noticed that I would play a level , then die , get resurrected , and lines of dialog that were audible before are not audible now . I now this because I had close caption on . The music was muted in this game ; there were n't as many Halo themes in this game during battles.The graphics in this game are excellent in cinematics . Yet , when the game is playing , there are resolution issues . In one level , I was riding a gondola and I noticed that the graphics looked like something out of Borderlands . There were also frame rate issues ; in one sequence , the frame rate dropped considerably.I have n't played multiplayer nor co-op , so I ca n't comment on those.For myself , this game is in line with other games of this generation . It plays like Call of Duty , Battlefield , Medal of Honor , and Fear 3 . I consider this game to have better graphics than any of those other titles . The music is on par with those other games . The campaign does its job admirably ; most campaigns in FPS shooters nowadays are tutorials for the multiplayer . They define what is possible and what can be expected in the multiplayer . Though I miss the old shooters , I know that the days of long campaigns , complex levels , and intelligent AI are things of the past . If a player wants to compete against an intelligent enemy , they can do so by playing against other players .	1
I love the multiplayer maps and i love the guns . But the ending is really boringThe easter eggs in this game is not as good as the halo 3 easter eggs	1
Awesome game , campaign was nothing short of spectacular . The Graphics are INSANE . The online multiplayer took a couple hours to get used too but now I see the changes were all very good additions . BUY THIS GAME ... if you want .	1
shockingly i think 343 actually made a better Halo game than bungie . color me impressed , the halo series was dead to me after 3. i thought that was a great way to end it . but 4 has a good story line , amazing graphics and solid gameplay with a few new twists.make no mistake its still the same game 10+ years later which isnt exactly a compliment but sometimes you like to be able to just pick up and play what you are used to	1
Halo 4 has been a real surprise . It surpassed my expectations in nearly every way . It gives me that same sense of awe that I first felt with Halo Combat Evolved all those years ago.The gameplay is smooth and refined . Everything I loved about past Halo games has been maintained and improved , while they have also added many new elements that make it even more enjoyable . The gameplay in multiplayer is faster paced , which I absolutely love . Come to think of it , even the campaign gameplay feels faster and more dynamic.The graphics are absolutely gorgeous . I play mostly on the PC and I am used to amazing graphics , but I am still impressed by the outstanding visuals in Halo 4 . The details and lighting are vastly improved over previous games in the franchise and the overall look is simply breathtaking much of the time . Definitely the best looking game on Xbox 360 , and probably the best looking game I have played on any console.The story is so much better than previous Halo games . I find myself being drawn in to what is happening and I find that it even makes me care about the gameplay scenarios more.All in all , this is by far the best shooter I have played in a long time and one of the best games of the year . Do yourself a favor and get Halo 4 .	1
My son absolutely loves this game . He got this for Christmas and he has told me twenty times how much fun it is . He loves the online play with his friends .	1
this a great comeback from halo the fall of reach , master chief is back and better then ever the graphics are fantastic , this game is so good it draws you in makes you feel for cortana and chief so much i nearly cried at the end that is how much it affected me i love this game and everything about the halo universe	1
Campaign - Let me start by saying that the campaign has more to do with Cortana than it does with Master Chief and that 's not a bad thing . From start to finish , this campaign had me hooked . The connection between Master Chief and Cortana has never been stronger . It has phenominal voice acting and I like all the characters . Halo 4 went a step up in storytelling from Halo 3 and all the other ones . Is this the best Halo campaign ? I say it is ; mainly because of Cortana and the new enemies , Promethians . Halo 2 was my favorite Halo campaign until I played this . I played this alone on normal difficulty and it took me like six hours to complete . It has eight missions with awesome cutscenes . I actually expected the campaign to be longer , like 10 hours long . There were two out of the eight missions that I really hated and could n't wait for them to end . Will I play this again with my friends on Legendary ? Most definitely . I was fine with the playthrough though and the ending of the campaign . What happened at the end was unexpected , now I ca n't wait for Halo 5 's story . Killing aliens with the chief has never been better and I applaude 343 Industries for taking the story in a new and promising direction . 100/100 ( A+ ) Graphics - This game has really amazing graphics and really utilizes the 360 's power . This game proves that the Xbox 360 does n't need a Bluray drive to play big games like Halo 4 . It 's the best looking shooting game I 've played on Xbox 360 . I wo n't go as far to say that the graphics looks better than Battlefield 3 , because many would argue about that . In my opinion the graphics does looks better than Battlefield 3 's because of the character modeling , the facial motions , and the quality of the cutscenes . Look at Halo : Reach then look at Halo 4 , big improvement . Best of all , I have n't noticed any tearing or framerate drops . It plays smooth . 100/100 ( A+ ) Gameplay - Halo 4 has the best AI . The AI is very entertaining . I love to hear all the alien sounds and fight a variety of different creatures . Halo 4 has this amazing new game mode called `` Spartan Ops . '' You would pretty play different chapters of an episode and there are even new episodes for people to watch . I 've watched and played two episodes so far with my friends . They were really good . The team at 343 really put hard work in this mode . It 's pretty much a replacement of Firefight . A great replacement . 343 said they will release new episode every week . So far two have been released and three more are coming . You can have custom loadouts in Spartan Ops . The gameplay covers many things . You have special abilities , a variety of special weapons , and cool vehicles . There is not one single flaw in this game 's gameplay and I will never get tired of it . Forge is pretty fun too . 100/100 ( A+ ) Multiplayer - The best multiplayer experience to date . Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 3 use to have my favorite multiplayer until I played this game . The progression system is better , the game is still balanced , and now you have custom loadouts . There 's this new thing called an `` ordinace . '' It 's pretty much a killstreak reward for when you are doing good , even if you 're just getting assists . When you get an ordiance , you have three options of what you would like . One thing I hated about Halo : Reach , you needed headshots all the time to kill someone . That 's not how it is in Halo 4 . The game is more competitive and takes more skill . I like that . I ca n't help but admit that a lot of aspects were taking from Call of Duty ; such as perks , custom loadouts , killcams , and killstreaks\pointstreaks . This is n't a bad thing to me . I enjoy the game the multiplayer . As of now , I have a 1.57 kill/death ratio . Not bad , not bad at all . Play Halo online has never been more fun and playing with friends has never been more fun . Also , you have a lot of cool spartan customization . 100/100 ( A+ ) Playing Time/Content : I 'm going to be playing this game every week . It 's too much fun . Spartan Ops will keep you entertained and so will the multiplayer . Heck , even playing the campaign on legendary with some friends will keep you entertained . Halo 4 provides enough content that does n't make you ask for more . I am so addicted right now . I would have paid $ 100 for this game . $ 60 seems like it 's too low of a price for this game . Halo 4ever , until the next one comes out . Also , the soundtrack is amazing . I bought that as well . 100/100 ( A+ ) Overall Score : 100/100 ( A+ ) Do n't know whether to spend $ 60 on Black Ops II or Halo 4 ? Get Halo 4 . It 's way better . Trust me.+ Spartan Ops+ Graphics+ New multiplayer features+ The story+ Master Chief+ File sharing+ Enemies+ Soundtrack	1
Epic game of the year ! Master Chief is back . Graphics to sounds of guns are better than ever . Multiplayer fun as hell .	1
I love this game so much that words can not express my love for it . I bet I 'll say the same for Halo 5 though . I almost love the campaign more than Halo 3 , but I do love the matchmaking and multiplayer more than Halo 3 . The campaign is n't the best though , the maps are n't so bad either but I prefer Halo 3 's maps .	1
Halo has been a major part of my gaming life since I first played it back all those years ago . I got it for my birthday with my first xbox along with a few other games . I did n't initially play it either , I was more interested in some of the others . But when I booted it up a few hours later , it was the game that made me love the xbox . More than that , it was the only game I got that year that I continued to boot up for years . Halo will always hold a special place in my heart , as I 'm sure it does for many gamers , as the first truly great shooter for a console . Bungie crafted a masterpiece of a game , and maintained that standard of quality with their subsequent sequels . So , when they finally passed the mantle of Halo off to 343 industries , I was understandably skeptical . In fact , I wrote it off when I first saw the trailer at E3 back in 2011 . But in the time between that trailer and November 6th they swayed me . I saw gameplay , heard about the story and novels going with the game . I went from being done with Halo to being completely ready for more . But could 343 match Bungie , maintain the standard set , or even more interesting , could they surpass it ? Well , yes , in my opinion anyway . Let me explain why.Presentation ***minor spoilers****I 'll start with what is most important to me , the story . This is where Halo 4 truly delivers . Halo 4 begins with the return of Master Chief , awakening from Cryo sleep 4 years after the third game . The covenant are attacking them for some reason and there is an odd forunner planet sucking them in . On top of that Cortana , Chief 's AI and companion through all the games , is starting to deteriorate due to rampancy . AI 's start to think themselves to death after 7 years , and Cortana has been active for 8 . This is where the strength of the plot is . The relationship between Chief and Cortana is put front and center , the space opera plot line , while also good , is secondary to the emotional story of Chief 's desperate attempt to save Cortana from her inevitable death . There is a genuine connection between the two characters rarely seen in games . This is all conveyed through the outstanding voice work done by the entire cast , but particularly by Jen Taylor 's performance as Cortana , who steals the show . The game is really more her story than Chief 's . An interesting byproduct of the story is a role reversal of the two . Chief is now having to think logically and problem solve when Cortana 's rampancy gets the better of her . In fact , all through the game she is getting him into as much trouble as the Covenant , or the new villains of the game , the Promethians , are . That brings me to the new villain of the game , The Didact . He is an ancient Forunner who is immensely powerful , worshiped as a God by the more fanatical sects of the Covenant , and somebody who has a great disdain for humanity . For the first time Master Chief has to face off against a villain who is more than capable of defeating him . The Didact is a threatening presence when he is around and you know defeating him will not be easy . Unlike the former antagonist , Truth , Didact has a clear and rational motive . He is ruthlessly efficient in executing his plans as well . I wo n't go into any more details , but needless to say the plot of this game is by far the best in the series . The characters grow , and feel real . The story moves at a good pace , never feeling too slow or too fast , and it really opens up so many possibilities for the future of the series.Secondly , the Graphics for Halo 4 are astounding . I know I keep raving about graphics in my reviews , but I am just blown away by what the Xbox can do . Halo 4 is perhaps the best looking xbox game to date . The landscapes are vast and gorgeous , the structures interesting and detailed , the character look , move and feel alive . Facial animations are on the level of LA Noir and motion capture is spot on . Nothing feels stiff or awkard about any of it . To give you an idea , in the cut scenes with Master Chief , I knew exactly what emotions he was conveying despite the fact that I never saw his face . The Body language says it all . The game is colorful , vast and just stunning to behold . It is a great argument for more games that use more colors than brown and grey . *cough*Gearsofwar*cough*As I stated before , the voice work is top notch in this game . On top of that the game 's sound is amazing , There was obviously great care put into making sure all the sound effects for explosions , mele attacks , and the guns sounded good . All the weapon sounds were redone and personally I think it is for the better . The music for the game is also quite good , but unfortunately there are only a few memorable tracks as opposed to the past games having several . I was disappointed by a lack of the series ' classics , including the main theme with the monks chanting , which is not on the main screen . That is a minor gripe , but I really missed it . Hell , I would n't mind if they would have just reused any of the main theme tracks from the first three games , but I digress . The music is still a cut above the competition , it just is n't the great and epic score that would normally accompany a Halo game thanks to Marty O'Donnell.GameplayHalo 4 's gameplay is pretty familiar , they did n't change much from Reach , in fact the controls are exactly the same except for a few button swaps . They are also air tight and 100 % responsive . This is n't a bad thing . 343 had a lot riding on this game , and playing it safe was the right call . If they were to change too much fans might not be receptive , plus , keeping the feel of Halo mostly the same from Reach makes it familiar enough for fans to transition with ease . If I was n't told that 343 was doing this game , I 'd have thought Bungie made it . Much like Reach , the armor abilities are back , some returning , such as active camouflager or jet packs , and some new like the sentry turret or promethian vision to spice things up . Thankfully the useless or unbalanced armor abilities like the drop shield or armor lock are gone or improved upon . An example of these improvements is the sensible decision to make sprinting something any spartan can do at all times . It is no longer an armor ability . The AI in Halo 4 is top notch as well , especially on Legendary . The enemies are smart , they will try to out think you and often surprised me with how clever they got . The Covenant were familiar though , but what really got me was how smart the Promethians were . These guys go from deviously clever to cruel and ruthlessly unrelenting . This is all good , as despite all this , Legendary is very fun if you like a good challenge . The Arsenal in Halo 4 is as diverse and wonderful as ever . Though not every gun or vehicle returns , all of the best ones do . There are also a wide array of great new weapons to use . Every Promethian weapon is a joy to use , though they are for the most part very similar to the kinds of weapons you 'd use from the human or covenant arsenal . I was let down by the lack of a flying human vehicle though . The Hornet and Hawks were so fun in Halo 3 and Reach respectively . Also weapons like the plasma rifle and sub machine gun were missed . Speaking of those guns , I am yet again disappointing that there is no dual wielding . That said , those are minor gripes , and the lack of some of those guns is perfectly understandable within in the context of the story . Theater is also back so you can take pictures and film events , it is pretty much the same , but this is a mode that did n't need to change , so it is quite alright.The Multiplayer for Halo 4 is perhaps the biggest surprise for me personally . I have always loved Halo multiplayer , but I confess I 've never been that good at it . Always been a single player kind of guy , but I love Halo so much that even if I was doing poorly I had fun . Halo 4 's Multiplayer , however , is quite different . I found myself actually doing well most of the time . This is likely due to the fact that I can customize my load out . I start with a DMR instead of an assault rifle and can pick off enemies from afar while also being able to handle myself if they get close . I always wanted to be able to start with weapons like that , and with Halo 4 's progression system , I can . Halo 4 does in fact borrow a few elements from Call of Duty , but it never feels like anything except Halo . The weapons you can start out with are just your basic automatic or semi-automatic rifles and pistols , as well as two of the 3 different kinds of grenades . It is insanely balanced so that nobody has an unfair advantage . Another addition is the option to call in weapons or power ups after you get so many points . Halo 4 runs on a point system so that everything you do gets rewarded , similar to Battlefield 3 . Halo 4 takes what is great about modern day shooters and applies them to Halo to modernize it . These changes are for the better . Also , unlike Reach 's leveling system , getting XP is not extremely slow and leveling up is worth it . Few armors feel out of reach and most anything These include things such as armor , emblems or stances . On that topic I actually found that I was n't overly excited about a lot of the armor . Most if it is great , but I miss my ODST helmet . Sure the recruit helmet is very similar , but I feel like there was no reason why they could n't bring all the armors back , and not just some of them . But again , that is a minor gripe that does n't make the game worse . If you want to acquire any of that stuff you can with a bit of time , patience and skill . Speaking of which , like Halo 's of old , the game is n't something that anybody can just pick up and be good at . You do need some skill to play , unlike CoD , which is so simplistic that anybody can do it . Usually if you get killed it is because the person got lucky , was better than you , or had better equipment . It is n't because of a lack of balance or over powered guns and perks . Most of the maps in the game are also quite good , my personal favorites are Haven , a map similar to Narrows from Halo 3 , and Ragnarok , a remake of Valhalla . Spawn points are fair and wide spread . Unlike in games like MW3 , you wo n't get spawn killed all the time because the maps are too small or spawn points are n't regulated enough . A great deal of care went into each map and it shows . The one potential down side is the mutliplayer requires 8 GB of memory off your hard drive , so just be sure you have enough space for it . Halo 4 's mutliplayer is probably the best of the series.On top of that , Forge has returned and is mostly the same , so much that a most of the building blocks and tools are exactly the same from Reach . They have new skins that are specific to the particular map they 're on though , so it is n't like it 's all the same thing no matter what . This is n't bad , but some variety would have been nice . This is kind of made up for by the addition of map specific items and minor improvements to the mechanics such as magnets , locking items and duplicating . These tweaks are nice , but not overwhelmingly imaginative and this forge is not the complete overhaul that Reach 's was . Also , the Forge maps are great , but none of them are as big or as versatile as Forge world was and it is disappointing to see that they did not make an equivalent , or hell , just a remake for this game . So while I ca n't say Forge is a let down , it also is n't something I 'm going to rave about . It is just mostly unchanged . Hopefully Halo 5 will allow 343 to really improve upon it in a significant way.Finally , there is Spartan Ops . This is the replacement for firefight . Spartan Ops is a weekly series of missions that tell an over arching narrative while also giving you lots of things to do . The maps are mostly reused from campaign missions and it all really boils down to killing lots of enemies and pressing buttons , but I ca n't complain . It is more fun than firefight in a lot of ways . It is n't as monotonous , and the story line that goes with it is interesting enough . I look forward to new episodes every week . I do feel like I 'm working towards something and playing with friends or even strangers is a lot of fun . It is a worthy replacement to firefight , though I think having both could n't hurt.So , all together , Halo 4 is a truly great addition to the Halo series . The story is emotional and well told , the gameplay is as solid as ever , graphically it is amazing and the mutliplayer is top notch . It is a triumph for 343 industries . The fact that they so bravely took the mantle of this universe and managed to delivered something truly wonderful is to be commended . Most developers would botch such an endeavor , but it is clear that Microsoft and 343 truly care about this franchise . The return of Master Chief is not just one of the best Halo games in the series , or even arguably the best , but it is also one of the best games I 've played all year . Its problems are all so minor and often just personal preferences rather than legitimate issues . Halo 4 is a front runner for game of the year and if you are a fan of the series , or just a fan of shooters , you owe it to yourself to get this game.10 out of 10Pros-Amazingly well told and emotional story-Great voice work-Fantasic sound-Possibly the best Graphics on the Xbox-Great enemy AI-Vast and diverse array of weapons and equipment-Major improvements on several gameplay mechanics-Modernized Multiplayer that stands out-Unlockables are within reach and easy to obtain-Customization is vast and fun-Spartan Ops is a great additionCons-Forge could have used more improvements and additions-The absence of firefight is disappointing-Spartan Ops maps could use more variety so 's to not feel recycled .	1
343i has pulled off what I thought might have been impossible . They 've improved and added to the Halo universe without losing the perfect Halo balance . Excellent job !	1
Made by 343 industries , this is the newest halo , but not quite like the others . Reach had the really exciting music that you knew was playing and fit the action , this does not.They do have new weapons and a new enemy , and the flood is not in the game except in dialog . It plays like halo , and is not a bad game , on legendary on my first playthrough , it took about a week solo . I was playing slow to get every single player achievement . It is interesting , and if you like halo , you should buy it , especially if you have the others in the series . For a first effort by 343i , it is good and went in a few new directions , but it plays like halo and if you need your halo fix , this will give it to you . There is a new part called spartan ops that you can play co-op or solo which you have to download , but it is free and will add hours of playing so it is definitely worth the money .	1
I was so excited for this game and when it finally came in the mail , I could 've fainted . It was new in its case and undamaged through shipping . This has to be any moderate gamer 's dream . Master Chief played a profound role in Halo 4 .	1
When Halo 4 was first announced , I was both hopeful and skeptical . Halo has been my favorite video game franchise for a long time , but after being somewhat disappointed in Reach ( particularly the multiplayer component ) and with a new developer studio taking over the reigns , I was n't getting my hopes up . The massive amount of media leading up to its release , though , made me buy it , and my skepticism has been washed away . The following review is divided into sections based on gameplay type : Campaign : Pros : As stated by some other reviewers , the Halo 4 campaign is possibly the best Halo campaign to date . 343 has done an incredible job creating dynamic and interesting levels with lots of variety in vehicles , weapons and environments . As with all aspects of the game , the graphics , coloring and mechanics are very refined . The voice acting and cinematic scenes are superb . However , the most striking thing about the Halo 4 campaign to me is that it has the best story of any FPS campaign I 've played since Halo : CE . It is exciting , gut-wrenching and intriguing . Combine this with the improvements in gameplay mechanics and level construction that have taken place since Halo : CE , and you have a masterpiece.Cons : The only thing I can think of to say in terms of campaign improvement was that more could have been done to explain the halo universe history necessary to get a good picture of what is going on at a couple points in the campaign itself.Gameplay : 5/5Story : 4.5/5Replay value : 3.5/5Overall : 4.3/5Multiplayer ( Spartan Wars ) : Pros : Spartan Wars is 343 's term for competitive multiplayer , as opposed to cooperative ( more on that in a sec ) . Although I 've only played a few hours of multiplayer to this point , the system seems extremely refined . More than anything , it just feels like playing Halo again , a feeling that ( for me , at least ) Reach did not really deliver . Although elements that might be considered non-traditional in Halo are included - such as sprinting , customizable loadouts and a number of new armor abilities - it all works . The core aspects of the multiplayer experience that make it Halo are all there , and it feels terrific . Sound quality and graphics are once again excellent , and the maps ( at least those I have played so far ) are very well-built.Cons : There 's really not much to be said here . So far I have yet to find anything that strikes me as really needing improvement in Halo 4 's multiplayer , which is an achievement no FPS has managed for many years . If anything , perhaps more playlists that preserve the traditional Halo style of everyone starting with the same weapons , etc , or even some classic playlists with no armor abilities/specializations would be nice ( just for when that 's what you feel like playing ) .Gameplay : 5/5Replay value : 5/5Competitive aspect : 4/5 ( due to few options for `` retro-Halo '' playlists ) Maps : 4.5/5 ( within each playlist there do n't seem to be that many options , at least at this point in time ) Overall : 4.6/5Multiplayer ( Spartan Ops ) Pros : Spartan Ops is 343 's episodic , cooperative series of campaign-style missions that are going to be periodically released over the next ten weeks . I 've played a few missions solo , but you can tell that they really are intended to be played by cooperative teams of 2-4 people in terms of layout and the enemies you are facing . The additional content is great , and the missions so far are decent fun.Cons : The missions for Spartan Ops ( so far ) seem to be more like Firefight mode from previous Halo titles and less like full-on campaign missions with an overarching storyline . I was hoping for more advancement of events in the Halo universe through these chapters , but perhaps that will come in some later episodes . Also , the play areas seem to be based heavily off of play areas that you also see in the single-player campaign . Not identical , but very similar in layout and graphical appearance . It would be nice to see some completely novel areas in at least some missions going forward.Gameplay : 4/5 ( Firefight with added objectives ) Maps : 3.5/5Replay value : 5/5 ( new content being constantly released for the next few months ) Overall : 4.1/5Forge : I have n't actually had the chance to play around with Forge yet , but based on the media and demo information released ahead of time , it seems that Halo 4 's Forge promises to be everything that Reach Forge was and more . Of particular note , I am ecstatic about several new features in H4 Forge , particularly the copy/paste function and MAGNET POINTS FOR SNAPPING PIECES TOGETHER ( Thank you 343 ! ! ! ! ) . Since I have n't actually used it yet , though , I wo n't include numerical ratings on its features yet.Overall : Fantastic game , one of the best FPS games I 've ever played with perhaps the best campaign of any FPS to date and extremely good online multiplayer options.Would I recommend this game to a friend : ABSOLUTELY YES	1
Game is great . Good story line . Graphics are terrific . Hope they do not ditch Cortana in the next one . Ca n't they just update her ?	1
There are a couple hundred reviews that go into the fine details of the game , so I wo n't bore anybody with more . I 'll just say that I 've been a Halo fan since the beginning , it was the reason I chose the Xbox over PS2 , and can honestly say this is the best Halo yet . Between being deployed to Afghanistan , the mediocre reviews on here and being let down with Reach , I held off on buying this until a couple weeks ago . The graphics are simply amazing ; as crisp and beautiful as any game I 've seen on a console . I 'm not a big online or multiplayer fan , I buy simply for the campaign modes and this is wonderful , a bit short , but awesome . If you are a Halo fan , buy this , you will not regret it it for a second .	1
I 've played every HALO since October 2001 . With the exception of & # 34 ; REACH & # 34 ; ( which was very poorly written ) , this new version is really taken me into the actual game ! I never know that i 've been playing it for a couple hours ! I highly recommend it to all GAMERS !	1
Definitely worth every bit of the money spent on this game , whether your in it for the FPS or multiplayer version both are very good . You can play the multiplayer levels at least 12 different ways and also you can get into the story level with friends .	1
OUR TEEN-AGERS ( AND DAD ) LOVE THIS GAME ! THIS GAME KEEPS YOUR TEEN-AGER ENTERTAINED AND QUIET FOR HOURS . IT DOES REQUIRE CRITICAL THINKING ... THAT 'S A GOOD THING ; HOWEVER , TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING IS NOT GOOD FOR A PERSON . YOU MIGHT WANT TO LIMIT THEIR PLAYING TIME , FROM A MOM 'S POINT OF VIEW .	1
Wow what a game ! From the multiplier to the campaign every aspect of this game shines ! You can really tell the company spent every penny they had on making a quality game . The sound is amazing you can hear everything and everything sounds crisp and amazing ! The visuals are the best the graphics are mind blowing and look even better on my 1080p TV ! This game is seriously so addicting . This game makes black ops 2 look like a joke they arent even in the same league please everybody give this game a chance you will not be disappointed this is the game of the year for sure hands down !	1
I came late to the Halo party being Playstation fan for years but after getting an old Xbox and playing the 1st two Halo games I was hooked ! I then purchased a 360 to get the rest of the Halo games , except Halo Wars . Then I got Halo 4 and it is the most magnificent game I 've played yet . The controls , weaponry , & graphics are fine tuned and are better than ever ! I 'm currently playing the story/campaign and it is very engaging . I highly recommend this game for all gamers .	1
I love this game . It soooo much faster than halo reach . Also you have the choice of choosing what gun you want to use instead having to use the gun they select for you like on halo reach . It is more like call of duty but faster . imagine call of duty being faster and having armor shields and you have halo 4 . I love it .	1
I have had a love-hate relationship with the Halo franchise over the past 10 years.Halo : Combat Evolved was a huge evolutionary leap forward for all console first person shooters in that it brought us a PC quality game to consoles for the first time . Master Chief was an undeniably badass character and the supporting heroes , villains , and overall mythology led to a gaming franchise that stand amongst the largest in the industry . I can fondly remember having LAN parties at friends ' houses playing multiplayer ... It was the reason that Xbox was able to turn into the brand it is today.The last 4 games in the series : Halo 2 , Halo 3 , Halo 3 : ODST , and Halo : Reach , have built upon the foundation laid down from the original with varying degrees of success . Xbox Live was created and a whole new online world was created within the Halo universe . I 'll be the first to admit that Halo has stagnated over the past few iterations . So much so that while I bought and played most of the games in the series , Halo : Reach was the only one I took the time to finish ( and that was on co-op ) . I never felt the need or desire to play online . Something about online gaming lacks the charm of actually shooting a friend sitting on the couch ( or other room.While I was skeptical about the release of yet another Halo game , I looked at the change of developers from Bungie to 343 as an opportunity to genuinely reboot the series . This version of Halo was either going to make or break my opinion of the series ... The amazing reviews and commercials also caught my attention and piqued my interest as well ... I just completed the game on Legendary with my cousin over Thanksgiving break and I must say that this is the best Halo I 've played since the original . In many ways , I enjoyed this game as much as that one . Why though ? This is a more mature Halo with the narrative driven by the evolving ( or you could argue , devolving ) relationship with the Master Chief and Cortana . If it has n't been said enough times , in short , Cortana is dying , and it 's up to the Master Chief to try and find a way to save her . Along the way , they naturally run into their nemesis , the Covenant , and accidentally awaken an ancient evil being called the Diadict.The relationship between the Chief and Cortana is the thing that really resonates with me . We 've been following these guys for 10 years now and finally , we see a human side to each of them that has been absent in the previous games . I 'm an older gamer ( 28 ) , my cousin is a teenager ( 15 ) , but both of us could see how their relationship drove the action forward in the game . We found ourselves wanting to beat the game not just to save the universe from this new evil , but more importantly , we were concerned about how we were going to be able to save Cortana.I do n't turn to shooters to play a game that will leave me with emotional resonance ; surprisingly Halo 4 was able to do this with its story , its atmosphere , and its music.How does Halo 4 play ? It plays like Halo ... refined . Now there is a sprint button . You can use power ups , a la , Halo Reach , in this game . To be honest , a lot of the levels , especially in the beginning had me thinking about the level design in the original Halo.It can , is , and should be argued that this game is the same game we 've been playing for 10 years . Yet after playing it , it feels so different to me because I actually really care about the characters now . 343 should be commended for their ability to bring out emotions in players who have invested themselves in the Halo Universe.The graphics are fantastic ; the cutscenes in particular are downright breathtaking . I really love the new score for the game as well . The music is very atmospheric and again , it gives off this emotional and mature vibe . I was totally digging it.The game is n't perfect . Stage 5 in particular was pretty painful with respect to pacing . Maybe it felt extra painful and borderline boring due to playing on Legendary . Let 's just say there were times where my cousin and I had each other and a Warthog available to us to battle like 6 Wraiths and 12 Banchees . We felt like they pounded us with enemies and gave us little to nothing to work with to artificially lengthen and toughen the game ... Wo n't lie , there are some plot holes and not everything is fleshed out as much as you would want it to be.But then again , this is Halo . It 's a shooter , not a novel , not an RPG ... the point is the kill enemies . I would liken it to interactive chess.I could sit here and share more thoughts , but the fact of the matter is , Halo is reborn . It plays wonderful . The controls are spot on . The graphics are sharp , the sound effects are excellent ( play at high volumes on a good surround system and you 'll appreciate it ) , and the engine runs smoothly no matter no many enemies are attacking you . And for me , it feels a whole heck of a lot more grown up . And to be honest with you , it 's exactly what I hoped would happen to the series . Fantastic job 343 ! It 's rare that I say a game is worth $ 60 . This one is worth it ; especially if you like playing online multiplayer .	1
Outstanding campaign and story . Art design , music , character development ... all top notch . Multiplayer is a blast as well . 343 really took the torch and expanded the universe impressively .	1
Halo 4 is a great game with so many new editions and changes . It is definitely an upgrade from Reach . for the people who said this game is terrible , you honestly did n't take the time to discover all the new changes.Multi-player- like in COD you can now customize load outs and name them.- you can use spartan points to buy new guns , customizations , and skills.- There is a feature that allows you to sprint forever- another feature called Promethean vision allows you to see through walls.- more skills i have n't unlocked it- The firing sounds of all guns have been redone and sound a lot better.- New guns- Assassination animations are amazing . Plus if your behind an enemy , all you need to do is sprint and hold RB when your behind the enemy and it 's an automatic kill . ( super sweet ) - ordinances and new multilayer games.I 'm not going to review the campaign because i have n't played it much . I would definitely recommend this game .	1
fantastic value . with campaign , forge , spartan ops and multiplayer online this is a great game for the price . each aspect is alot of fun . happy 323 took control from bungie- a vast improvement . the best halo since the original . they did sort of mess up forge though and from what i 've seen fewer people are using that for custom matches .	1
Great edition to the Halo franchise .	1
343 topped bungie here . Bungie may have innovated halo and multiplayer on Xbox live but 343 improved it . I think bungie hit their peak with halo 2 . I could n't get into halo 3 or odst . Reach was cool story wise but still highlighted aging graphics and gameplay.All the complaints I had were solved with halo 4 . Story and gameplay are tight . Story telling is probably the strongest here because you start to really understand master chief and cortana . I wished they explained more background on the enemy but that is probably for future halos to tell . The graphics are some of the best on this console generations . the cutscenes and in game graphics were superb . All that aside , I also wish the final battle was more engaging . Too many games have anticlimactic final boss fights . Multiplayer is the best . This game is so well balanced that I almost never feel overmatched or outskilled . The studio and publishers do n't force lame gameplay balancing on you like ea which has ruined battlefield for me . If you also like halo , check out cry sis for a unique and fun sci fi GPS	1
Halo is still halo and this game is a great installment into the halo series . Although Halo is beginning to lose its luster since it has been pretty much the same since Halo : Combat Evolved the gameplay is still as fun as ever . I would recommend this game if not for the multiplayer to at least play the story since they did an excellent job picking up where Halo 3 left off .	1
This game . Is awesome . BUT HUGE bummer for me that I took a star off for is that there are NO human air vehicles in multiplayer ! Only in Campaign . But hey , personal preference this game is bar-none the best halo ever made . I could not say that for Halo Reach , but 100 percent for Halo 4 . Good Job 343 .	1
It 's a little short for coop play but still very enjoyable with very good graphics . I hope that 343 continues the excellent work .	1
what can i say ? this game is a huge improvement up from reach . it has amazing graphics , sounds , and good replay value . i would recommend this game to people who like fps games and people who say halo is bad because this game stomps black ops 2 in the ground .	1
Great game , the graphics are awesome , the music too , and the gameplay is awesome , i recommend to everybody , buy this game ! ! !	1
Is very funny , i enjoy the multiplayer and online options , if you want to play a few minutes , suddenly you will see the time pass like a rocket , is an addictive game , is better than other action games thet you find nowadays	1
If you 're looking for a change of pace from COD then BUY this . The big team battle is extremely fun with great vehicles to use . The mantis is awesome .	1
Even thou I like Halo 3 better , this one has better graphics ... I was expecting more , but it is still great ...	1
I want to love the whole package , I 'm a big halo fan . However , the multipayer has been a bit too `` CoD 'd up '' . It really is n't anything like the traditional Halo gameplay , which I will have to take a full point away for because multi is so important in this series . However , campaign fans like me will LOVE this game , so I will give it a strong 4 . I could give details but there are already a couple of hundred reviews here which undoubtedly say it all . I 'll just say that I loved the campaign hugely , the multiplayer not so much .	1
This is a great game , if you like shooter and a good story , this is a must have game , great online game play	1
Pretty fun , however i 'm more a GoW hardcore fan , and halo seems a little slow for me . Maybe is just my idea , but is the one my friends have , so every now and then we get together to play a bit	1
Having played every game in the halo series , I could n't wait to for halo 4 . Overall , after a day of playing , I feel this is a decent torchbearer despite some shortcomings . Here 's my breakdown : -STORY- ( 5/5 ) As usual , the storyline is a masterpiece . I wo n't spoil it for you but the game puts you right into the story immediately that continues from the last installment.-GRAPHICS- ( 5/5 ) Absolutely incredible . Cinematics have details that look very real . Just a beautiful game throughout . Cortana looks great too ! -SOUNDS- ( 5/5 ) Music - perfect . Sound effects - perfect . I even like the muted effects when I 'm in space.-CAMPAIGN- ( 4/5 ) Love it but it 's too easy ! I completed the first four missions on Legendary and only died a few times . I did n't struggle nearly as much as I did with Reach or any previous halo . I usually play each halo in Normal mode first to try to enjoy the game in a casual setting first and then jump to Legendary for the second pass but Normal mode is really Easy mode . Other than the difficulty level being downgraded , the campaign gameplay is respectable and a lot of fun.-MULTIPLAYER- ( 4/5 ) Spartan Ops is OK but I miss firefight too . New multiplayer maps are decent , about the same caliber as Reach.-GAMEPLAY- ( 4/5 ) The new HUD is awesome and makes me feel like I 'm actually wearing a helmet . It works really well ! However , I do n't like the weapon changes ; for instance , the battle rifle does n't `` feel '' right and the magnum is missing the snap . Although the controls are generally very good , I do n't like that I ca n't customize my controller . I have a set of configuration choices but ca n't remap a button independently.-REPLAYABILITY- ( 5/5 ) I do n't get sick of halo games , I just do n't . It 's like watching a great movie over and over again , there 's always something new that I pick up that I did n't catch the first time ( or tenth time ) .-AMEX BONUS- ( 5/5 ) Sure , syncing a credit card might not be for everyone but if you sync halo 4 with amex , you can get many passive rewards . I got $ 10 for syncing , got $ 50 back on $ 100 voucher at Best Buy by doing a Spartan Ops mission , and will get $ 25 credit on my card for completing the game in a few days.-RECOMMENDATION-This is an instant classic and a must-have for any FPS fan . It 's not perfect but the developers did n't just roll out a mediocre game just to keep the brand moving along ( e.g . Duke Nukem , COD , Madden ) . This is a fun game that I will be enjoying until the next halo is released .	1
Halo is one of those games I buy just because I feel like everyone should own a copy . I 'm usually more into realistic games like sports games and GTA , but this is an exception . I must say , the campaign was a whole lot of fun . I do n't think there is any Halo game better than this one . 343 did a great job with the graphics , gameplay , and FUN ! The multiplayer is great . I like how they remade some of the Halo 3 maps . It 's like Halo 3 with much better graphics and cool load-outs . The newer maps are also very well made . They are fun and organized . Everyone should always have a Halo game in their collection of games .	1
This was a Christmas gift for my son . He loved it . It was in great condition and came in early . It was just like it was described .	1
This was an incredible bonus gift for us to find to go with our son 's new XBox360 , which he will receive on Christmas morning . Thank you Amazon.com for stocking this just in time for the holidays , and selling it for such a competetive price .	1
To start off , I 've been a huge fan of the Halo series since Halo : Combat Evolved . And I must say that Halo 4 takes everything far beyond what I expected . ********Campaign ( NO spoilers ) ********To start do n't worry I 'm NOT going to spoil a single thing from the campaign . I have been waiting to write a review until I finished the campaign , and have just done so . I must say that before getting Halo 4 I was very skeptical because of how much seemed to have changed from previous Halos . However , immediately into the game it feels just like Halo . Greatly improved yes , but you definitely feel like your playing a Halo game . In my opinion , more so than even Halo : Reach . There were parts of the campaign where I started to feel nostalgia of Halo 3 ( Partially due to the fact that many of Halo 3 's weapons return , but also because gameplay feels similar even with armor abilities ) . And there was so much mystery and serious suspense throughout the whole game that really could draw me into the story . I love every Halo game ever made ( Halo Wars included ) , though the story for most of them seemed rather obvious where you could guess the beginning from half way through . In Halo 4 it was not until the last 15 minutes of the last mission where I realized where this was going , and even then I could not tell it 's direct route it was going to take . I would 100 % , hands down , say that Halo 4 's campaign is my absolute favorite of all of the Halo games to date . ( told you there were no spoilers ) ***********War Games ( Multiplayer ) ***********A quick note I would like to make is that you are REQUIRED to install disk 2 , about 3 gigabytes , to play the multiplayer . Once it is installed you play every part of the game on disk 1 and never have to touch disk 2 again . Now the multiplayer is so large and customization heavy that I wo n't go in to every detail , just highlight my personal favorites . There is actually kind of story to the multiplayer now in the fact that it is a set of `` War Games '' for Spartan training on UNSC Infinity . I though it was kind of interesting of 343 to try and give a reason to the multiplayer other than just kill each other for no reason . The new armor system is kind of a mix of Halo 3 's and Halo : Reach 's . You must rank up higher levels to get new armor and load out options . Load Out options must then be bought with `` Spartan Points '' . Emblems now also require ranking up to unlock different ones . The multiplayer is very balanced and very fun to play . Without writing a twenty page essay on all the details of the multiplayer , it is truly amazing . *****Forge*****Forge quickly became one of my favorite modes in Halo 3 , when it was first introduced . Halo 4 does not fail to improve upon everything . It is so much quicker and simpler to make an amazing map with the new features . My top three of the new features would be : Dynamic lighting , Duplicate , Magnets.Dynamic Lighting is part of the new engine that now make forged objects cast and receive shadows from everything else . Instead of having the whole side of an object with the same shading , the shadows are rendered dynamically . Duplicate allows you to simply press DOWN on the D-pad to make an exact copy of an object with the same settings as the original . If you want to make a large bridge colored green , for example , you could make one bridge piece turn it green and duplicate the whole way down to make all the pieces match . Magnets allow forged objects to stick to each other at certain points . Going back to the bridge example , you would have to use coordinates or a lot of time to get the pieces of the bridge perfectly aligned , the magnets would make the ends of the bridge pieces stick together . There are a lot of other things that are improved in Halo 4 's forge , but I do n't want this review to be too long.So to wrap this up ; I would most definitely encourage you to get Halo 4 . If your worrying that maybe 343 Industries screwed up the Halo universe , do n't because they did n't .	1
Halo 4 is the best of all the Halo 's out there . I cant tell you how much I love this game . Halo 4 offers any thing a Halo lover could want . Between the Spartan opps , Matchmakeing , and the good old fashoned Campain , this game had everything I hoped for and more . GREAT GAME ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I 'm a huge halo fanboy so I was alittle concerned when 343 took over but I 'm proud to say they made a fantastic game . Halo 4 is a must have game .	1
What more could you say , its Halo , great multi player and a meh story though it is start of a new trilogy	1
What a game . If you have not purchased it yet , do not hesitate anymore . The game is amazing ! There seems to be an endless supply of maps , and FUN !	1
Who does n't love Halo ? ! The emotional campaign , legendary multiplayer , and overall greatness is just great ! Halo 4 really brought the franchise to the next level ! The graphics are MUCH better and the gameplay is even better now that there new aspects such as & # 34 ; Promethean & # 34 ; weapons and new powers .	1
After spending several hours this morning playing the game , I 'm slightly mixed with how I feel . Note : My first comments below about Call of Duty is based on Black Ops , the only Call of Duty game I own . So references I make are from my experience with that game , and may not work with the Modern Warfare Series as I have no experience there . And as someone pointed in the comments , Battlefield is also in the mix as they did some of these things before Call of Duty . So , while I have play a good assortment of games , my wallet does n't allow for all games haha.CAMPAIGNThis is what I played a lot to begin with . The campaign adds something the game has been missing for awhile and that 's a new breed of enemies . The past few releases had good storylines , but it was the same enemies . The covenant is still in this game , but the new breed emerges early and adds for a nice change of pace for the series . Thus far , 343 Industries has done a great job with making the campaign look nice while keeping the gameplay smooth . Also , there are new weapons . Some are good , some are not that great . But it 's something different and that is what has been missing from the recent releases . The campaign has intrigued me and I 'm interested to see where it goes from here.MULTIPLAYER ( You 'll need to install the 2nd disc before you can play ) This is where the game becomes very similar to Battlefield/COD . Some people will probably think it is a knock off with Halo characters . The game adopted their loadout system that allows you to change between a set of primary weapons , secondary weapons , armor bonuses , and other items . These can be set in your start menu and can be swapped around in between respawns . During the game it has that feel of Battlefield/COD . It begins with the start of the match with a similar announcer and visual graphics when the match is over . You also now have the ability to drop ordinances when awarded . Similar to care package drops . This includes grenades , weapons , power boosts ( increased damage and speed ) and other items . Also like those games , you gain credits to buy weapons you can add to your loadouts . Purchasing armor is about the same as Halo Reach , so nothing really new there . Aside from the feel of Battlefield/COD , the multiplayer still plays very smooth and the new maps are always refreshing . It 's still your well put together Halo game that the true fans like myself enjoy.These were the two things I focused on my first go around . When I turned it off , I was semi-happy with my purchase . While the new feel to multiplayer is nice , it far too resembles those games but with Halo players . It seems obvious that 343 Industries was wanting to pull from the popular franchises . It may be to try and gain some of their faithfuls , but it 's hard to tell if it is going to drive away some true Halo fans like myself . Time will tell . It may have been a bit too much . In the end , you 'll be able to make your own call on whether it was similar to those games . Even the group we play with , who are big Halo fans , felt the same way . One made the comment , `` This makes me feel like I should have just waited for Black Ops 2 to come out . '' Probably not what 343 Industries was going for .	1
I 've always been a big fan of Halo , so it 's no surprise that I enjoyed this one as well.I 'm not a huge fan of loadouts in multiplayer , but they 're relatively we 'll balanced . All in all a good game , and a great game to play with friends .	1
Awsome great game , love it Awsome What can I say ? it 's halo ... ! ! ! ! Awsome great game , love it Awsome What can I say ? it 's halo ... ! ! ! !	1
I must say another Halo game was long over due . But here it is Halo 4 & it is worth the buy . Reason enough to buy an XBOX360 dispite the fact that microsoft wants to continue charging for everything . Amazon rocks my item came fast and in a great state .	1
Online play is for sure way revamped for the little I have played , connection online seems to be ok. Graphics are for deffs way better then the other games , they did a great job . The campain for me tho was good until you leave the planet , then I was confused , I just imagined H4 ending differently , just wandered off to what the heck is going on now ? Online 4 , Graphics 5 , Campain 3 .	1
This game was fantastic , without question . amazing cut scenes , awesome graphics , great gameplay . really happy with this purchase . Look forward to more installments !	1
I loved Halo through Halo 3 , and I thoroughly enjoyed ODST and Reach , despite taking my sweet time to get to them , expecting them to be bad.Well , I thought Halo 4 was going to suck . I was really worried - new dev team and all . I was surprised . It is easily the best game in the series . The typical fantastic story line , some awesome new weapons , awesome new enemies , etc . I 'm really glad I decided to give it a try !	1
I 'm a pretty huge fan of the Halo Franchise , and needless to say that I was super excited for this game . But because of some of the disappointments , I would definitely recommend that people who have n't played a Halo game before should wait until a price drop or play the previous games first.Things to look forward to : The story surrounding the campaign is super immersive , and the characters have been vastly improved . The new enemies are actually terrifying to fight against and pose a much higher level of challenge than previous gamesGameplay is fun and addictive . The new caretakers of Halo have revamped all the guns , redesigned the enemies , added new suit upgrades , tweaked the graphics ... Basically did everything a newer version is supposed to doMultiplayer is an absolute joy . Tweak games to your liking , go on-line for competitive gaming , play Spartan Ops ( mini episode-like downloadable missions ) , and forge entire new maps . There are a lot of options here , and you 'll be kept busyThings I did n't like : The campaign was TOO short . I 'm sorry , but a game this hyped up should have at least given 24+ hours of campaign time . I finished the game solo on Hardened difficulty in a little over 10 hours.The campaign was slightly confusing to people who do n't know about the Halo UniverseFor the same people , the game could be quite challenging as wellAdded quicktime events . Again , this is just a personal peeve , but in previous games if you tried to press a button while being shot at , you 'd die . In this game , it can be used as a quick escape/moment of invulnerability .	1
Great game , and fantastic story . Loved it , ca n't wait for Halo 5 . Love Master Chief , hope he lives to be an old man with a great wife and kids . I really hope he has a happy ending , but not before he goes through Halo 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , and several more games . In fact I ca n't wait for him to be in a movie .	1
I did n't know what to expect from this Halo 4 . I played Halo Reach but did not enjoy it . I played Halo 4 and I love it . It 's very different from what how I last remember it . I love the extra perks , the new weapons , and vehicles . It 's much more intense when everyone might be using different perks which give both their own advantages . It 's what made this Halo much more delightful . I played some of the campaign and the graphics with the scenery are great as well . I love this Halo 4 game more than any other Halo . The last Halo I loved was Halo 2 , and Halo 4 definitely tops any other Halo published .	1
Ok guys , You cant go into this thinking its going to be another Halo . Because its not ... ..They pretty much re-made the entire series in 1 game.So if your going into it expecting another Halo game , `` Your gon na have a bad time '' That being said : I do not like the way Cortana was remade , She was ugly , emotional , and very clingy . So the direction they whent with that was not well done at all , in any aspect.Seriously 343i . Cortana was horrid . Almost Unbearable to watch . Alot of the scenes with Chief and Cortana felt more like soap operas.However , I loved the rest.The graphics , the story , the new weapons/race are great.I like the direction they are taking the Halo universe . Its a change , and in a series like this . Change is good .	1
Baby company ? Not any more . 343 did an outstanding job , while going in a completely different story direction with the campaign . The story starts 4 years after the events of Halo 3 . The flood has been eradicated , and Master Chief has been freeze- sleeping the whole time , and is woken up by a rouge Covenant troupe that is raiding the Forward Unto Dawn for supplies . After that preliminary mission/ tutorial , the game 's campaign takes off in an ambitious direction . The graphics beat all previous Halo games ' to a pulp . This installment feels way more like a sci-fi adventure than the previous games , thanks to an extremely high polygon count and a frame rate above 60 . The sound effects are exemplary , and make the atmosphere of the game that much more science fiction . The music , however , is different than the past scores . That 's not a bad thing , as the new score is fantastic and sets a new tone for the series , I kind of missed Martin O ' Donnel 's iconic Halo theme . This game actually plays differently than the past installments . Believe it or not , this one is actually easier to pick up and play than the past games , or at least I thought so . Halo 4 is an addictive experience that lasts 10+ hours , with the sheer fun being enough of an incentive to play through a second or third or tenth time , let alone the achievements . The multiplayer is fun and fast paced , with all your favorite game modes from the Halo series , with enough new modes and modifiers to keep you coming back for more . I give Halo 4 a 10 out of 10 .	1
I really like this game , the co-op campaign is great . All of the multi-player games are also good . Great buy	1
I 'll admit , I was skeptical . Bungie moved on to other things and a relatively unheard of studio called 343i , was taking over . But Microsoft was n't going to let Halo die , and it is clear they wrote a blank check to get the job done . If you are a Halo veteran like myself , welcome back soldiers . If you are new to the franchise , it is good to have you on board.1 . What 's new ? A new class of enemies , the promethians . Much like the covenant , the promethians are class based , but unlike the covenant , the promethians build on one another , and work together . This adds an interesting new take on campaign combat.New weapons . There are tons of new weapons , including new grenades . Now there are UNSC , Covenant , and Promethian weapon classes.Spartain Ops is a new co-op based weekly downloadable mini-campaign . This is free and will include a total of 50 missions ( 5 per week for 10 weeks ) . Content includes hi-res CGI clips that build the story for the missions.New competative game modes , like dominion ( domination ) regicide ( Free for all with a king ) , and Flood ( a dedicated mode of infection ) .New competative features that modernize the franchise , including slightly lower health , and a slightly faster pace.All new sound , including weapons , vehicles , and soundtrack2 . What 's stayed the same ? Master Chief . And Cortana . Enough said.The feel of Halo . That methodical , team based gameplay that you know and love has returned . Although Halo 4 has its own distinct feel , it has taken some cues from Halo 3.Although there is a new class of ememies , the Covenant you know and love , make a return.The Battle Rifle is back ! As many vets remember , the BR was a fan favorite ! With the exception of ODST or Reach , the grand galactic story driven campaign is back and better than ever.I 've said it once , I 'll say it again . If you are a Halo Veteran , fear not . Halo is in great hands . If you are new , there has never been a better time to hop on board ! I can safely recommend Halo 4 to gamers of all sorts !	1
great game , I am a halo enthusiast , also this comes with a 15 day trial of xbox live gold . The campaign was 7-10 hours on normal with few deaths until main & # 34 ; boss & # 34 ; / & # 34 ; finales & # 34 ; . Legendary would take much longer with much more dying and frustration . I love the multiplayer but it seems like there are n't enough game types .	1
This game is absolutely incredible and I would strongly recommend it to anyone . It is Halo like before but much more advanced with new weapons , game-types , and enemies .	1
Wonderful Game , highly recommend . 343 did a wonderful job of keeping the halo tradition going and providing a wonderful game .	1
Twenty words when it only takes a few . Awesome online , spartan ops keep you busy if you do n't like online . Campaign is long enough to keep you busy for hours . Rewards are fun to reach for . Just play It ! ! !	1
My brotheri s a big Halo Fan and he has been wanting the game but we could not afford $ 60 for it so we waited till the price came down he says its the best so far	1
The single player is typical of halo games ... Absolutely great . the game play is moving in a more fluid manner now , with the addition of a standard sprint function , and the story of the campaign is stellar.i am giving it a four and not a five solely because the multiplayer is not as fun as it used to be , there is no dual wield capability , and it seems you are always out of ammo in single player .	1
I was a bit worried after Bungie jumped ship on Halo but this was true to the originals and kept a lot of the gameplay and multiplayer elements that made the others such big hits	1
This game controls very well , making multiplayer feel smooth and fun . The multiplayer maps do leave something to be desired , but the visuals are great - from the texture on the rocks to the water , it 's got uniquely distinct art style that jumped out at me.The addition of grinding to unlock armor is OK when left to purely visual customizations , but the specializations actually change the behavior/play ... They seem to be borrowing from other multiplayer shooters and incorporating 'classes ' ... it 's not quite class-based yet , but it does n't feel like it belongs in Halo . Personal opinion .	1
The story was amazing , multiplayer is as good as it was in Halo 2 . I think nothing more needs to be said but I will anyway.Graphics are steller , Some games get good scores on graphics and I never understand why . This is not the case . The cut scenes are like watching a movie ! Gameplay is perfect and selecting a higher difficulty is very rewarding . I found no glitches while playing through on heroic the first time . Love the changes spartan ops missions and the level design of multiplayer . I wo n't miss the spawn killing , no scoping of COD ever again .	1
This is the top selling game of all time and top online game of all time . Pick up a copy . Easy to learn why .	1
The best Halo out of the entire series . Pretty much a die hard Halo fan . Halo 3 was the reason I even bought an Xbox 360 . The graphics are the best I 've ever seen in a console game , not to mention the story . THE STORY is really quite amazing . I was a little leary about 343 taking over , but ... not only did they appease my doubts , they completely blew me away with what the did with the universe ( Forward Unto Dawn was amazing TOO btw ) ... ... .. I ca n't wait for the next installments in this iconic series . Which is set to debut on the next generation Xbox as well . I can hardly imagine what they 'll be able to do with technology that is current instead of an aging 7 year old console . Great multiplayer and Spartan Ops is a welcome addition.Well done 343i and Thank you from the deepest points in this geeky heart o'mine.c0nflict3d	1
Bungie went out with its swan song Reach . though it was n't the most enjoyable game from the franchise . But now that the series is in the capable hands of 343 industries we have nothing to fear . Halo 4 is amazing right out the get go . everything you loved from the series is back and the chief is ready to kick some butt . The campaign and multiplayer are fantastic . spartan ops is a super awesome addition and there is so much content here how can you not love it ? ? definite buy for a halo fan and a must buy for a gamer ! ! ! !	1
I started this after going straight through the first 3 games again . While the story was decent and it felt like it ended the story nicely , the plot for this one was n't as good as the previous 3 games I do n't think . The graphics were really nice though and the gameplay was a lot of fun so it was still worth it for me I think.The seller I picked this up from did not say the case on the one I bought had a big ugly yellow spot at the bottom stating it was from a bundle and not to be sold on it 's own . I 'm disappointed about the ugly spot as it covers a large portion of the bottom of the image on the front of the case : ( If I had known that I would have bought it from a different seller : (	1
Awesome game , great quality . Shipped on time . Just anyway you see it , it 's a great buy . I totally recommend it .	1
I am a huge Halo fan and this game is ... Amazing ... . I was not disappointed one bit.. From Halo CE to Halo 4 , they are all good ... . Well except for Halo Wars ...	1
I loved the Halo franchise that Bungie created and have been playing since Halo 1 existed . 343 Industries shows through HALO 4 how much respect and love it has for the franchise and made it that much more EPIC.HALO REACH was by far the best HALO I have played and will still be one of my top games of all time , but for now HALO 4 will take my NO.1 spot.Controls are the same as any of the previous HALOS , with improved graphics , more variety of weapons , more balanced gameplay , different enemies , and a story to keep you at the edge of your seat.This is a `` MUST OWN '' for anyone who has any interest in HALO . One of very few games out there that is worth paying a full $ 60 .	1
Halo 4 does a lot of things right to correct the fatal flaws from Halo : Reach . However , some of the additional features violate the core experience that has always been central to Halo multiplayer gameplay . This review will highlight changes in multiplayer - War Games mode.Halo : Reach suffered a major misstep by introducing armor abilities . Thankfully the two most problematic abilities from Reach are corrected in Halo 4 - the jet pack 's flight time is significantly reduced and players can no longer become temporarily invincible . Unfortunately , Halo 4 not only retains sprint , but makes it available at all times to every player , even going so far as to give the option ( through custom loadouts ) to have unlimited sprinting.The Halo series has always emphasized a level playing field , where skill matters more than luck with strategy and teamwork being as integral as coordination and reflexes . Halo 4 eschews the concept of a level playing field by offering loadouts that increase in power as a player earns points by playing Halo 4 . By allowing players to start each life in a multiplayer match equipped with a sniper rifle and other items unavailable to players who have invested less time playing Halo 4 , the game compromises its integrity . Halo 4 also introduces a feature where after several kills a player is able to call down a supply drop featuring a power weapon , grenades or an enhancement like overshield . Many matches become saturated with power weapons , whereas in Halo 2 and Halo 3 , players were forced to fight over the few power weapons and this added an important strategic element to gameplay.Multiplayer combat in Halo 4 is fast paced and chaotic compared to Halo 2 and Halo 3 , which I much prefer . Certainly as you become more experienced playing Halo 4 , the chaos will become more manageable and orderly and the pace will seem to slow . However , I feel that the way sprinting is implemented combined with instantaneous respawning pose a big problem . When a player successfully wins a combat encounter vs. another player , their team should gain a temporary advantage by being a man up and also , the losing player should not be able to re-engage while the winner is still recovering ammo and shields.Another change I dislike in Halo 4 is the new scoring system . While I love assists , distractions and other contributions counting towards something tangible , it seems that deaths make little to no impact on scoring . Certainly a player with 8 kills and 4 assists but 12 deaths does not deserve a better score than a player with 6/4/4 . Also , I miss the ranking system from Halo 3 , where your rank could go up or down and represented your skill . Now your rank mostly measures how much time you spend playing halo and is only minorly affected by how well you play - worse yet , commercial promotions currently offer double xp.Despite the flaws introduced in Halo 4 , I think that it improves the multiplayer experience from Halo : Reach , which made me stop playing Halo altogether for the first time since I picked up Halo 2 . My gold xbox live subscription had lapsed long ago by the time Halo 4 came out . Halo 4 is not Halo 2 nor Halo 3 and I can live with that . While I am disappointed by some of the strategy and skill defeating features , Halo 4 offers enough entertainment and satisfaction to justify a new gold subscription .	1
Awesome game , it was even better when I also received instant video credit . Every HALO fan is going to love this game .	1
First of most people probably stopped playing Halo after Halo 2 came out if they know what good games are . The problem with Halo 4 is it almost is Halo 4 's & # 34 ; recovery & # 34 ; to it 's & # 34 ; relapse & # 34 ; . This game came out and blew all expectations out of the water . I 'm one of those guy 's who doesnt play for the campaign so if that 's you then you may feel otherwise . As far as online goes , this feels like a mix of the Halo I 've been missing mixed with Call of Duty ( Spoiler Alert : Care packages , perks , ECT . ) The Multiplayer is fast , they upgraded certain aspects such as joining games while in progress , and added small simple things like an extra rifle for games that get a little repetitive after a while like SWAT . If you loved Halo 1 and 2 you will love this game and if you fell off after Halo 3 , ODST , Reach , ETC then GET BACK ONLINE ! ! ! !	1
I have not yet played this game but will soon , I fell for Halo on the PC and after the ending of Halo 2 on the PC I wanted to continue the storey and find out what happened next to Master Chief . I bought my Xbox specially for halo and gears of war . Us crazy gamers .	1
I 've been a Halo Fan since the XBox first came out . I played perhaps 500 hours of Halo 1 , an equal amount of Halo-2 ( mostly multi-player ) , a fair amount of Halo 3 , and a bit of Halo Reach.This is my favorite Halo since the original . The original was groundbreaking , and great for when it came out . This is a great game for today . It 's superior in every way to Halo , but we *are* after all 10 years later : ) I 'm most of the way through the campaign , and have played several multiplayer games . Both campaign play and multiplayer have evolved since the previous halo , and both in good ways.The game is mechanically sound . The rendering is great , and the people look almost real , absolutely a step up from the previous halo 's . They managed to improve the rendering without losing the flavor of Halo , which is itself an accomplishment.CAMPAIGN : + Great story line , especially if you 've read some of the books ! + Good mix of Master chief and vehicle fighting scenarios+ Some great new weapons and enemies to fight , with awesome visuals , a departure from the traditional covenant . I really , really like the new knights & other creatures+ The voice acting and animation are all good , without being too over the top+ Auto-saves are spaced just right , making it a bit challenging but not impossible+ Includes all the goodies from before : different difficulty levels , and skull settings for extra variety & fun- The campaign is a little short . I 'm about 4/5 through , and have played perhaps 6-8 hours . This is on the 'standard ' mode , though , I have no doubt that the harder modes will take longer.MULTIPLAYER : + Multiplayer feels fair , and has most of the controls and displays you 're used to.+ New feature : when you get enough kills , you get to pick a weapon to materialize near you . There 's still contention over resources on the map , but this is a nice alternative+ New maps are nice , the play style on them feels familiar . So far I have n't seen any significant flaws in their layout.What can I say ? I 'm a fan ! I 'm looking forward to playing Halo 4 ( and Black Ops 2 if it turns out to be good ) almost exclusively for my game time for the next year.Absolutely , positively worth buying this one if you like FPS games , or are a Halo fan .	1
first off.I want to let you know that Im not a BIG halo fan . I played the crap outta the first one , skipped the second one , played even more of the 3rd one as well as ODST and reach . I USED to be a big halo fan but it seems to me as time went on I started to be more into COD franchise . COD 4 , MW2 , and BLOPS . Last year I bought battlefield and have played that solidly for a year.Ok so now you know my gaming history for the past years . Lets talk about halo 4 . I had a big decision this year . I went and bought premium of battlefield ( $ 50-which if youre thinking about picking it up , just buy the 'premium edition ' and you get everything included for $ 60 ) Anyway my budget allowed me to get one more game for this year , and it boiled down to halo 4 or blops 2 . As some of you could guess by now , halo 4 was my choice . And I am very happy with my decision.I knew BLOPS would disappoint me , especially coming from a such a big fan of bf3- ( seems like you really cant be both a cod fan and bf3 fan-but some of you will probably disagree ) the gameplay is different . I like to have dedicated servers , tactics , brand new engine and class based in a FPS , and that is what the game delivers for me . So from that perspective , I picked up Halo 4 because I wanted something different . Since it came out I havent been able to play any other game . I absolutely love it.It comes with 2 discs . 1 for campaign and the other for MP . The second disc only has the maps for MP so you will have to have the space to DL the maps to your harddrive ( ~8gig ) , once they are downloaded you will only use the 1st disc ( I love this set up , no longer are the days of constant switching of discs regardless of campaigning or MP ) Halo 4 has more of a mature feeling about it than previous halo games . I was a little nervous to know that a 3rd party developer would be making the series from this point forward and when I first heard about the next trilogy in the making I was a little skeptic..could they resurrect of a 'dying fps ' ? Well the answer is yes ! I am a little short on time so I will just break it down quickly . The graphics on this game is absolutely amazing , it steams from halo 3 engine but 343i was able to tweak it to a way that it looks and feels great , the lighting , shadows , etc look flawlessly on my 60in plasma . The controls are super smooth and the gameplay is particularly enjoyable . It seems to me that 343i have gone thru and redone all the sounds for the weapons and most have a 'throater ' pop when the weapon is shot . Very Nice.I am a competitive XBL player and I have enjoyed both campaign and MP greatly ! The cut scenes in campaign are so gorgeous its hard to believe that it isnt a movie shot with real people , I cant explain it but you have got to check it out . MP is very competitive . It has leaps and bounds over previous halo MP . You now can sprint using any perk . Some say its a futuristic COD..I say its still halo with a hint of COD ( like adding a lime to your coke , its still a coke with a twist ) . if someone quits mid game that spot can be replaced to keep the game going fair . I cant wait for more maps to be released . Im a big 4v4 slayer fan and it seems I play the similar maps a great amount . More diversity would be greatly appreciated . But that to me is far from a deal breaker , those objective gametypes are a nice addition and some of them are new to halo ! You now have load outs which can be purchased by in game points that you receive everytime you level up , you can apply these points to gun unlocks , perks , special abilities , armor ( purely cosmetic differences ) , grenades , etc ! if youre somewhat techy like me you would like to know that this game runs at 720p ( thank you for being around forever xbox ) and 30 fps-which the naked eye doesnt see anything more than that anyway..and when explosions happen in the game I havent seen any rendering or chopping issues . Altho split screen I did experience some lag , not sure if it were the split of the screen or the connection of that game . Also you can play any gametype up to 4 players on the same console for MP ( not sure of campaign ... havent tried ) This is nice considering Reach it depended on what gametype you chose to determine how many players can play on the same console ( 2-4 ) . MP connection is a p2p , i wished it had dedicated servers but only experience one game of split screen lag , ( in the dozens of games that I have played so far ) Hope this review steers you in the right direction . I try to stay as unbiased as possible , but I feel that this game is the biggest bang for your buck and will keep you interested for a long while . I have to say that 343i has more heart than any other developer that Ive seen ... maybe bc this is their first game ? I hope they stay humble.5 stars .	1
343 Studios has breathed new life into a series that was quickly going to trash and starting to feel like a cash grab . Stunning graphics , great gameplay , and an intriguing story-line .	1
I never thought Halo could feel new again , because the series has been reworked so many times at this point , but Halo 4 delivers the goods . The campaign , although I have n't finished it , is really fantastic . The multiplayer is what you would expect of other Halo games , but it 's still just as much fun . I recommend the game .	1
This game is by far the best Halo game ever made . The only thing that sucks is there is n't firefight anymore . Other than that , this game is incredible . Well done 343 Industries , you 've surpassed Bungie .	1
This game is incredible . From gameplay to visuals to graphics to enemies to storyline to overall experience to multiplayer to everything else this game is truly one of the best . The halo franchise is classic and incredible and this may be the best of them all . This is the kind of game you will put hundreds . Of hours into and never get tired of . I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys high quality entertainment of any kind .	1
This game blows away borderlands 2 and will blow away black ops 2.Everything is really fun , but do n't expect the Multiplayer to be the traditional Halo Multiplayer , it has kill cams , weapon load outs , new leveling systems . everything about Multiplayer is new.Halo is a lot of fun , I 've only played a couple Multiplayer games , i mostly been playing the campaign.I Think Assassins Creed 3 , Borderlands 2 , and Halo 4 are close runners for game of the year edition.Amazing game , and a fun campaign with more Master Chief talking and excellent story .	1
Excellent game and the Amazon sale made this game irresistible . I have spent quite a few hours with the game on hardcore mode and the Spartan Ops are wonderful . Shipped fast and was received quickly . Thanks Amazon for offering new stuff at lower prices , and quick delivery .	1
Amazing game and the graphics are amazing in the cinematics I was thinking it was live action.You will not be disappointed , especially if you are a halo fan , BEST HALO YET !	1
If you are a HALO fan , than HALO 4 will definitely fill you will great graphics , storyline , multiplayer , and the chance to continue on the quest for freedom in the universe with Master Chief doing what he does best , and that is kick butt and take names .	1
I loved this game ! I was a little skeptical of how 343 would do with this but I think they did a great job ! I love the graphics , the story is pretty good , multiplayer is very fun , and Spartan Ops is a fun part of the game as well .	1
This is the best Halo Yet ! This game presents great missions and challenges that keep you playing . Most importantly it offers online multiplayer that lets you compete with and against your friends . The is a great start to the second triology !	1
Muchas gracias me encanto el juego y las pantallas adicionales que trae adem & aacute ; s de los 14 dias de prueba para xbox live .	1
Halo Man 's back in action ! Er ... Master Chief 's back in action . I ca n't say I 'm the biggest Halo fan . I generally like the series but definitely felt it was going in the wrong direction since Halo 3 and ODS or whatever that other one was called . Halo Reach did bring me back to respect the series again with a good story acting as a prequel and a farewell from Bungie . When it was announced that there was going to be a Halo 4 my first thought was ` ... really ? I thought Master Chief died . ' I only found out about the true ending to Halo 3 last year ... Yeah , I did n't really care to play through the game on legendary . So my very first impressions for Halo 4 were n't too good and it has really stayed off my radar till this week and sometimes it 's best to not have your hopes up for a pleasant surprise . Maybe it 's because AC3 was such a disappointment but I really liked Halo 4 . It 's also been awhile since I 've played a shooter . I stopped playing them for awhile because I had grown tired of them ( THANKS CoD ... ) . I have to say this is the best Halo game I 've played since Halo 2 back in 2004 . It has some miss steps in game play and story but seems to be a promising start to a new chapter in the Halo series.STORY : The game starts aboard the wreckage of the UNSC starship Forward Unto Dawn , four years after the events of Halo 3 . The holographic vixen AI that is Cortana wakes up Master Chief from his long cryogenically induced sleep as the remains of the ship they are on is being attacked by Covenant forces . They discover that they have drifted near the mysterious Forerunner planet Requiem . During the battle , the planet activates a gravity well and sucks them into it . On the surface they encounter the Covenant who are searching for something and they also encounter cybernetic beings known as Prometheans . As they explore and battle through this bizarre planet , they discover a being called The Didact that was imprisoned here and inadvertently release him . He , of course , wants to kill all humans and take over the universe . In the midst of all this , Cortana reveals to Master Chief , who has been with him since the beginning of the series , that she is going rampant , a condition that happens to AI 's over 7 years old and ultimately results being shut down aka death . And this plot point is the strongest part of the story . The interesting relationship between Master Chief and Cortana gets really looked at and developed here or more so than in the previous games . You know that the fate of Cortana ca n't end well and it weighs in on the heart strings throughout the game . It also shows that Cortana , a computer AI seems to be more human than Master Chief , a human . Not an ordinary human , but human none the less.The campaign finishes up around 10 hours , which is sadly rather long for an FPS game these days . The story is presented well and has a good pace . It kind of sags in the middle which is not helped by game play that gets a little repetitive by that time but it does pick up again . It is a bit predictable , especially if you 've played other Halo games . Outside of Master Chief and Cortana , other characters are not really explored . They are just mainly there to move the plot along . There are some new Spartans including a female Spartan who is there , says a couple lines then is gone . I think she is supposed to be from the expanded universe but I 'm not sure . Speaking of expanded universe , I think there are a lot of references to the Halo books in this game but , me having not read them , did not pick up on them . Like I said , the best part of the story is the relationship between Chief and Cortana and even that I wish was developed a little more . The story and game does n't do much to take any risks outside the usual fair that the series puts on . I will say it does have a bitter sweet ending and I am curious to see what comes of this new chapter in the Halo series.GAMEPLAY : For those who are familiar to the Halo series , there are no big surprises to the controls and plays like pretty much all the games before it . Heh , though some hardcore Halo fans are mighty pissed at some new additions because it 's too much like Call of Duty . I do n't know what they 're going on about because the only thing I can see that was added was a sprint button which is great . I would have liked to see the ability to aim down the sights with all the weapons besides the ones with optics but then again , some of the weapons in Halo do n't even have sights . I do n't know how anyone is supposed to actually aim with the assault rifle but anyway . There are a lot of weapons we know from previous games that return a long with all new weapons use by the Prometheans . The coolest thing about these guns is how they look and act . They disassemble and reassemble on their own when you pick them up and reload . The first time you see it , you 'll be like WOAH THAT 'S AWESOME ! Some of the weapons feel a bit under powered but that 's mainly the assault rifle type weapons , the other guns feel just right . A really cool new weapon that was added is called the sticky launcher and is fun to use . It shoots a little sticky explosive that you can remote detonate . It 's great for killing large groups of enemies.The new HUD is neat looking with the corners of Master Chief 's visor visible in the corners of the screen so it feels more like it 's from his POV , kind of like Samus in the Metriod Prime games . It does , however , make the screen a little cluttered , especially when holding a big weapon . Makes me feel kind of claustrophobic , I do n't know . Now one thing that has always bothered me about Halo is that , Master Chief , this guy with super power armor , does n't really feel all that powerful outside of a regenerating shield and being able to jump like he 's on the moon . Now I never gave this all that much thought until I played Crysis 2 . Crysis is the way to do an FPS with a character with power armor . In Crysis , your character has invisibility , hard armor mode , increased speed , jumping , and strength that are all regulated by a power meter in your HUD . You do n't need any items to do any of this , it 's up to you to manage these powers with the energy meter and it adds a dynamic that lets you play the game however you want . I was hoping there would be more things like that in Halo 4 . My wish was half granted in the form of power ups that you can swap out . Things like hard energy shields , cloaking , thermal vision , portable sentry bots , come in the form of these powers that you can find and swap out . These are kind of like the shield items from Halo 3 but instead of being one time use , they recharge when they are not being used . They 're not bad but sometimes it 's hard to really know which one would be more useful to you as you progress through certain areas and most of the time it does n't exactly matter.The game play tries to stay exciting and varied with some fun vehicle levels and flying type space shooter levels that return from Halo Reach , though I feel the space combat level from Reach was better . There are some levels near the middle of the game where some of the repetitiveness from some of the older games shows through , ie run and gun from way point to way point . It would have been nice to see Halo try and step out of its safe zone more than it has . That 's the problem a lot of these mega franchises have ; they are afraid to step out of their comfort zone in fear of upsetting and losing their fans and the majority of their fans pretty much ask for the same thing over and over again , be it they realize it or not . I 'm looking at you Call of Duty . Speaking of which , there is this multiplayer part . Totally not the reason I bought the game but I know it is the reason millions of fans did buy the game . Now , I have no way to play it online at this time so I know I 'm missing out on the meat of the game that the fans really care about and if you want me to invite me to your house to play online or whatever , I 'd be down with that . I do miss the old Halo parties I used to go in the mid-2000s . But we did n't need the internet ; we just needed a bunch of tvs and networking hubs . Anyway , from what I 've seen , the actual game play in multiplayer looks pretty much like it has been since Halo 2 . I know there is a new class system that is supposed to be a lot like how Call of Duty 's multiplayer system which has a lot of fans up in arms since they want Halo to be nothing like CoD even though Halo 's multiplayer success is what paved the way for the success of Call of Duty 's multiplayer and becoming the money making machine it is today . Multiplayer is no big deal to me . I 'm an old school gamer in the sense that multiplayer is that extra little thing you do after you beat the game and have some friends over . If there are any real changes in the multiplayer that I should be aware of , please let me know.GRAPHICS : So I 've been kind of ragging on this game about the game play and such but I can proudly say this about Halo 4 : This is one of the BEST looking games I have ever seen on the Xbox 360 . This game is just beautiful . The environments are so lush , vibrantly colored , have amazing lighting and are heavily detailed . You have look , I mean , really look to find any slightly blurry textures or anything . The weapon effects and explosions all look awesome . The HUD and sights for the weapons are all nicely detailed and look great . The character models all look fantastic and use facial scanning animation technology which I love and add depth and feeling to the characters . Master Chief looks amazing and his armor is so finely detailed . Cortana looks hotter than ever . Yes , I think Cortana is the hottest hologram AI ever . The rendered cut scenes are so high quality I honestly thought I was watching something that was filmed live action at first . Best of all , there is absolutely no slow down or frame rate drop in the game . 343 Industries really knew how to use the 360 's hardware and produced one of the best looking games for the system ever.SOUND : Just like the graphics , the sound design is something to marvel at . To the loud explosions and sounds of battle to the little clicks of reloading your weapon , everything sounds so crisp and clean . The musical score is beautiful and I even went and downloaded the soundtrack after playing the game . All the voice acting is well done and believable with the exception of Master Chief . This game is probably the most I 've heard him talk and while he sounds great in his usual calm and cool voice , it 's the few moments where he actually has to raise his voice and make an emotion that made me laugh . However , it 's Jen Taylor performance , who voices Cortana , which really steals the show . The heavy emotional state that Cortana is going through is brought to life by Taylor and oddly makes her feel like the most human character in the game . Excellent sound for an excellent looking game.Overall , Halo 4 is a beautiful game that sadly has a few missed opportunities . If it had just found a way to expand the game play more , take some more risks , and enrich the story a little more , I 'd say this would be THE game of the year but it misses the mark . This game is meant to start a new chapter in the series so I am curious to see where they go with it and hope they can do more to really expand it in the future . If you 're a Halo fan , what I say probably is n't going to bother you because I know you 've probably already beaten it and are spending hours playing online . If you absolutely hate Halo , this game is n't going to change your mind at all . If you 're on the fence , I 'd say it 's definitely worth picking up in a couple months after the price goes down some.OVERALL : 7.5/10	1
Not only is this the best looking Halo yet , but this game also has the best story yet of any Halo game . Very much looking forward to playing the next two Halo games and seeing where the story goes . Do yourself a favor and pick this game up !	1
I had n't realized Bungie did n't make this iteration of Halo until after I had bought it . I do like the game well enough , and it 's still fun as ever , but there are some slight differences which I 've noticed.- I used to love that main music when you got to the main Halo screen . That chorus was awesome . Angelic . Now , they have a single person ( cheaper ? ) and it 's pretty annoying.- I do n't like that I ca n't play online with other people like I used to for Halo 2 . The game tries to download something and says there 's not enough room , no matter how much I delete . ( It would be nice if it told you how much space you needed for a download BEFORE downloading it ! ) .- The playability is pretty solid . Controls are a little different than before but I 've gotten used to it.- The weapons are awesome . The enemies are great . Fun stuff.- No load times - The game loads up quick then you 're done ! Very cool.- You ca n't just save when you want . You have to save *and quit* . Annoying . I 've re-started games and found I 've had to re-do whole levels because there is no auto-save feature ! ! !	1
Halo 4 is a wonderful addition to the world of halo . It continues the Master Chief epic with beautiful scenery , fun game play , and a wonderful plot that gets you closer to Chief and Cortana . Multiplayer is fun as well . I find that it is much easier to jump into a game of halo 4 multiplayer and do decently well compared to other shooters . Add in the Spartan Ops and you have multiple fun and challenging ways to spend your time . Although I find myself playing a shooter released at a similar time more than halo 4 , I love jumping back in and spending time leveling my spartan in multiplayer . Another great thing about halo 4 , was that if you have an american express card you could get statement credits or a coupon at best buy for achievements on halo 4 . This made playing the game even more rewarding . Lastly , kudos to 343 studios for continuing the excellent job that Bungie did on this wonderful xbox platformer . Next stop , Halo on durango : )	1
It 's a good game but for the price I like to purchase games the kids will replay . Has the average violence and adult language but no nudity like Mass Effect .	1
My hubby wanted this really bad and Amazon had the best deal . It came right on release day and he played until he finisheed the game . Then started over ! !	1
I like Halo 4 , it ' is better than Reach , and it has more maps and game types to choose from .	1
and its fantastic . The campaign was great ( a bit repetitive in the middle ) , multiplayer is the best since the original , new guns and enemies are great . The art and graphics are mindblowing in some areas . Just a warning , this game is super difficult ! Also , Spartan Ops seemed like a gimmick at first , but it is actually a continuation of the main storyline of the halo universe ! Very , very cool new feature , especially if you are into the canon . The cutscenes in this game are the best I have ever seen .	1
Another addition to the franchise and just like the other , not bad at all . Only thing I disliked was the bad ending .	1
I was concerned about 343 developing Halo games but I was surprised when I played the game . It still feels like Bungie 's Halo and what I really care about . The graphics are amazing and the core gameplay remains unchanged . The campaign only has 8 levels but they were all pretty good . The story was awesome . I really like the multiplayer . I think it has the best fps competitive multiplayer .	1
Shipping was really fast , product was in perfect shape , but they should n't have shipped it in an envelope.The game itself has a fun story line , not as fun as halo 3 , but people buy this game to play online , which is way better than halo 3 , You get to customize your spartan , and you get loadout screens now , just like COD .	1
As an avid fan of the franchise , I had no worries about the quality of Halo 4 upon it 's release . The original studio , Bungie , had handed down their baby to 343 Industries and I honestly can say that they did one damn good job.When you first play this game , you 'll notice it is graphically beautiful . Although it is not necessarily a necessity for a good game to have amazing graphics , they definitely did help to the experience.Right off the bat , you 'll also notice how different and yet similar the game feels . The game heavily implements tools placed in a previous Halo installment , Halo Reach , and uses them as new mechanics . The game , itself , still returns to it 's roots by feeling like a Halo game but it also creates an entirely new experience as well.The singleplayer storyline is rather action-packed and a fulfilling experience . The ending ( no spoilers ) might confuse you a bit but when you think about , it 's a science fiction shooter so do n't be too surprised . Masterchief is a little more talkative in this game ( which is unusual ) but it 's nothing too jarring . Cortana returns as her lovable self and players really delve into her character and struggles . The difficulties are similar to previous Halo games and each one adheres to each playing style.As for multiplayer , Halo emphasizes strongly on versus multiplayer as much as it always has . It plays rather well and combat is essentially balanced . Players have been arguing and crying out over the superior power of the DMR ( a rifle ) but the game is highly based on player preference in play style.The game modes range all over the place from silly to classical game types on maps that are either came with the disc , DLC , or were made using the forge feature in the game . In the beginning , there were complaints about a lack of diversity in gametypes but 343 Industries is really stepping it up . My only complaint is that I miss an old gametype from Halo : Reach called Invasion . It was Elites ( alien race ) vs. the Spartans ( aka many Chiefs ) . They also changed the zombies gametype to Flood , which makes sense , but it 's a uneasy transition for silly fans like me.There is also the hallmark to the new Halo installment called Spartan Ops . It 's a cooperative online experience that is released episodically focusing on a story surrounding the Chief and what was going on with the other Spartans during his epic journey . Each episode starts with a five minute cutscene and then allows players to play through the five missions in the episode . Some of the missions can feel rather irrelevant but others really push the story forward . It 's a great experience and all of it was free right on release day.Regarding DLC , so far there have only been map packs . They implemented a free DLC map called Forge Island . The name speaks for itself but it 's essentially a map made for players to create anything they want on . The other maps have their features and aspects but they are just maps and do n't necessarily enhance your gaming experience.All in all , if you 're a fan of first person shooters , science fiction , or the Halo franchise , I highly suggest you pick up this bad boy as it is a good deal of fun . It definitely sets 343 Industries as a driving company for the Halo universe and really instills faith back in to the gamers . Some may disagree but I 'll be upfront and say that they did a damn good job . It certainly is n't perfectly but it 's definitely worth a look .	1
In my opinion is the best halo .it have got excellent graphics and the multiplayer is very addictive , ten points for all	1
This is the absolute best in the Halo franchise . The graphics are amazing , multiplayer is phenominal , and the campaign is great . I highly recommend this game to all Halo fans .	1
This latest release is a great addition to the HALO series . I think it 's one of the best releases yet . I have played all the games and find that I like this as well as the first and second releases . It 's a must have for any true HALO fan ! !	1
I played a good amount of Halo 3 when it came out years ago and loved it . So far , I love Halo 4 . It contains a lot of the positive elements from past games and improves on the past poor elements . I have n't play the campaign yet but I love online multiplayer : ) .	1
If you like the Halo series or are new to it , GET THIS GAME ! It 's fantastic . I bought an XBox just to play it ( having played on a friend 's machine ) .	1
Now , I 'm a hardcore fan of Halo Reach , but I 'm not going to make any comparisons between the two only because Reach had a long way to go when it first came out , and now it 's packed with different playlists and maps . I assume the same will happen with Halo 4 . I say this because my only complaint thus far is that `` there are n't enough maps or playlists '' but I realize it just came out . Anyway , the graphics , for one , are amazing . Watching it in HD is a treat , but I 'd imagine it 'd look pretty good on most TVs . The music is also lovely to hear ; very full of passion and feeling , even though it was n't even the same guy who composed it as the other games . I like that sprint is always a possibility , and there are many different armor effects , some of which are pretty useful . The gameplay is still very similar to previous games , so it does n't feel like a totally different franchise . I 'm not sure if some people may be disappointed by this , but I was glad to feel like I was still playing a Halo game.There are new weapons , and there are indeed new enemies . The story also was very captivating ; it seemed to have a lot more cutscenes than previous titles , but they interested me more than previous games ' scenes had . I felt like we were getting to know John a little better , and Cortana seemed a lot more lifelike than ever . The campaign had less missions than other Halo titles , but it was still fun , action packed , beautiful , and interesting.The multiplayer is fun , as well . So far there are only a few gametypes , but I know that will change . A new map pack was just released ( but I 'm not reviewing it here ) . Even though the multiplayer gets a little repetitive due to there not being as much content as say , Halo Reach , it 's still a lot of fun . I have n't really found any glitches or anything of that sort . Flood is a fun gametype that is exactly like Infection , but you are Flood instead . There 's SWAT which is personally my favorite gametype.The last thing I 'll discuss is Spartan Ops , which although some have said it is lacking , I enjoy it a lot . For one , there are a ton of episodes and chapters . The graphics and gameplay are just as great in these missions , and it 's a lot like Firefight , only `` with a purpose , '' as 343 promised before the game came out . When I 'm getting tired of matchmaking I sometimes play Spartan Ops because it 's still action packed but a bit easier ( depending on which difficulty you play ) .I would say that this game is worth its full price . I eagerly anticipate new content and gametypes that will come about , but it has still offered me endless hours of play already . I 'm happy if a game gives me an hour of play per dollar , and this goes above and beyond that .	1
I started playing Halo since the 1st iteration . After playing the crapolla out of Halo 2 ( the best Halo until now ) and playing Halo 3 I stopped playing for a while . Halo 3 was great visually but the story was meh and the gameplay was ok. After getting hooked on Call of Duty there seemed very little reason to come back to Halo.Enter Halo 4 . From the very first scene I could tell that this was going to bring that same feeling when I played Halo for the first time . Visually stunning from the first few seconds and the story is much more engaging ( IMO ) . I would imagine that it would be a challenge to continue a much loved franchise and make it fresh and new while still keeping that feel that fans want to experience . Studio 343i has managed to do just that , and some ! Master Chief 's relationship with Cortana is deeper which draws the player into the story more , because ultimately relationships are what makes stories great.This game is fun and engaging . I 'm playing with my daughter and we 're literally playing on the edge of our seats . We do n't know what to expect next and the mystery and suspense is a wonderful experience . I do n't have anything to say about the multiplayer because we are still going through the campaign but I 've read/seen reviews that praise it.In conclusion , I 'm just very excited to complete this game and I had to give my two cents about it in this review . I think this is a very good start for the continuation of an amazing franchise that has brought countless hours of fun and excitement to people all over the world.p.s . My ONLY gripe is that I can not dual wield anything but I forgive them for leaving it out .	1
this game is a fun game in story mode and is hours of entertainment in mutiplayer mode . kids love it and so do i ... now i just have to stop getting my butt kicked by my kids	1
I got the game for Christmas and it was the first game I played on that day . When I put it in I went to to War Games and it said to download something to play online that was just over 1GB . Then I tried to play Spartan Ops and it was another thing over 1GB . So if you have a full Xbox or the the small 4GB Xbox you might want to get a flash drive that costs $ 5 and up.After that I decided to play the Campaign . Since I have played other Halo games and since I have read about it I decided to play on legendary since it would give me a challenge and has some Xbox Live Achievements for doing so . And I was right , it was short but worth it ! If I would have played on easy I would have beat it in a day or two . Since I played on Legendary it took me about as long as Call Of Duty games or games like that.The online War Games and Spartan Ops are vary fun and would never end . Since you could keep leveling up higher and higher . It seems to put you with your level so if your really good you will be put with others really good and people ( mostly little kids ) will be put together.So this is why I gave it 5/5 . It is super fun and my only complaint is the downloading .	1
This is one of my favorite games now and i really like it a lot . Good shooting game for kids .	1
Halo 3 was beautiful with story line and multiplayer , but when Halo 4 came out . 343 industries blew me away . The new looks and textures are so much better . I miss dual wielding though . Spraying someone down with two plasma rifles was my favorite . Overall most fun I 've ever had in Halo .	1
I thought the price was too good to be true . Game came undamaged in one day ! I 'd recommend this to anyone . Halo is a great FPS too	1
I bought the original Halo when it came out on the Macintosh computer years ago . I bought my first Xbox to play Halo 2 , and upgraded to a 360 for Halo 3 . Needless to say I have played all the Halo games , and am a fan of the series . Here 's what I have to say about the new addition to the Halo universe ... Halo 4 delivers.There has been some skepticism on how Halo 4 would turn out , especially after it changed hands from Bungie to 343 Industries.. ( I 'll never forget Bungie coming onstage on a very early Apple keynote event , presenting it 's new game `` Halo '' ) And I 'll admit , I was a little nervous myself . I was always happy with how Bungie had treated the series , and when I heard Halo had been given to 343 Industries , I wondered if they would `` ruin '' Halo.Let me put that to rest for you right now , they have n't . 343 Industries was given a Ferrari , and they treated it like one ! They put time , effort , and extremely hard work into this game , and it shows.And since you are eager to buy this game and not waste time reading a massive book review , I will touch on some of the key aspects that you may want to know too . **STORY/GAMEPLAY**One of the biggest things that makes the Halo games SO darn fun to play is that they have an INCREDIBLE story . It 's the thing that sets good movies apart , the storyline . Halo has always had one of the best stories in gaming history , and Halo 4 continues this legacy . No spoilers , but Halo 4 does n't drop a beat , you step right back into the Master Chief 's boots like it was yesterday . The gameplay is still `` Halo '' and it feels right . Simple , clean interface . Easy controls , and a story that makes you feel like the Chief himself.At first I was skeptical , ( At the end of Halo 3 , I mean , how could you come back from that ? ) but I could n't be more wrong . I love the Halo lore , and this story is no different . I will enjoy playing this campaign ! **GRAPHICS**Let me say something right off the bat , this game is GORGEOUS.This is one of the greatest ( if not the best ) looking Halo game of the series , maybe even one of the best on the 360.The environments are breathtaking , the weapons and vehicles are polished and the maps are vivid and lifelike . The team spent hours into the design of this game and it shows ! Your eyes will be drooling . **MULTIPLAYER**No doubt , one of Halo 's strongest points has always been Multiplayer . I 've loved the multiplayer even since LAN games on Halo 1 . And yet again , with no surprises , Halo 4 's multiplayer is insanely FUN.It keeps the same of tradition of guns , vehicles , and brawling , but with a shine . 343 added some nice elements into the multiplayer , like Mantis ' , new weapons , and fine tuning of the load-out system ; but it still FEELS like Halo , which is great ! It 's still a blast to play , and very easy to jump right into the action . Assassinations are still there ( I liked that addition in Reach ) and I like it how 343 took some nods from the community and made things like Infection ( now called `` Flood '' ) built-in playlists.The multiplayer in Halo 4 also offers nice incentives to level up and build your character , this makes Halo 4 even more fun to play , and it 's not boring to play the multiplayer over and over again . **SOUND**Another thing that is fantastic about the Halo series is its score . Music that moved you , took you places , and filled with all kinds of feelings from fear , to victory , to sadness . The music in Halo could fill you withadrenaline or inspire you with awe ( Halo : Combat Evolved anyone ? ) Neil Davidge did a fantastic job in continuing Halo 's great sound , it does n't disappoint . I heard that Halo 4 's soundtrack sold so many copies , it would make the UNSC take a second look. -- -- -Halo 4 is an absolute gem . Bungie handed over their baby to 343 and they took great care of it.I 'm thrilled as a fan to see it given the attention and time it deserves.It 's a fantastic game , with endless replay value . Whether you are getting this for yourself , or a friend or two , you WO N'T be disappointed . It 's a heck of fun to play , and it looks , sounds , and plays beautifully . This review is short , and there is SO much more in Halo that I could n't even begin to write about here . The rest you 'll have to experience for yourself ! Hopefully this review has convinced you to scroll up to the top of this page and `` Add to Cart '' Trust me , you 'll be glad to did ! See you on the battlefield ! -- -- -- EDIT- FULL DAY OF PLAYAfter playing Halo 4 for many hours now , I decided to knock off a star . Here 's why.Do n't get me wrong , none of these things deserve the game to lose a star by themselves , but put together , they do.. sadly..**MULTIPLAYER**After playing many , many matches on Halo 4 , here 's what I found..-RESPAWNINGseems to be a little contradictory ... It has a timer , but you can spawn back AS SOON AS you die . This can be frustrating because your opponent could spawn just feet away and come right back for vengeance.-MAPSI absolutely loved the maps in Halo 3 , and Halo Reach . Halo 4 's maps can get old fairly quickly ... I think they over/undershot map size a bit too . There 's no `` wow '' factor like when you see a map as massive and great as Halo Reach 's Blood Gulch remix.-LESS CUSTOMIZATIONthan Halo 3 or Reach . Not terrible , but they put tons of stuff into armor , but cut the many emblems , accessories , ( e.g . wrist , arm , etc ) Do n't get me wrong , they have TONS of armor helmets and they are BEAUTIFUL , I just felt a tad disappointed at all the cuts elsewhere.What I would LOVE is a `` Classic '' playlist on Halo 4 , where everyone gets the same weapon loadouts , and respawn timer is MANDATORY . Just for fun . This could also be used to bring player in to Halo 4 gradually . **STORY**No spoilers.My only gripe with the story so far , is that it seems a tad ... rushed . Nothing terrible , mind you , but I would 've enjoyed a little more time ( I mean.. MC has been frozen for years ... Give me some time to see him come `` alive '' ) but the story is still fun to play , and if you 're into the Halo lore , it wo n't disappoint.Still , a very , VERY fun game to play , just some small wrinkles that lost that one star , for me at least .	1
The first HALO is what got me to switch from the PlayStation to the Xbox , and I 've been there ever since . But after the first HALO I never found the same connection to the follow up games in the series . Still a die hard Xbox gamer , but wanted HALO to evolve with new graphics and action . Now , for any of you who may have been on the fence about picking this game up , I can say without a doubt that the HALO you loved in the first game is back .	1
i love the halo games , be a fan since 2002 , ca n't wait for the Halo 5 , P.S Call of duty SUCKS	1
Me and my friends play Halo we played the campaign and made boards and multiplayer crazy fun we even made our squad .	1
Upgraded graphics engine really shines with the return of Master Chief . Everything about this game is spectacular , a clear improvement and step forward for the franchise .	1
Game was as it should be fun and The price was right I would recommend it to anyone ... .Good item to buy	1
My son loves it and I have a hard time getting him to do his chores on time . Great game .	1

This is an amazing Halo . It 's a must have for any Halo fan . New weapons , new enimies , and hours of fun . Enjoy !	1
I personally think that halo 4 is the best halo game to be created so far . Halo 4 is jam packed with an awesome new campaign , awesome multiplayer , awesome forge mode , and unbelievable graphics ! Halo 4 is a great game when playing by yourself , with some buddies , or online playing people around the world . Did I mention that the maps are amazing too ? Well they are amazing . I highly recommend this game !	1
This game is gangsta . Over all the past Halo games , this one is by far the best . I have yet to try multiplayer on Xbox Live but from playing countless hours on Single Player Campaign , I am very impressed by the improvements that have been made to this iteration over others in terms of graphics , new weapons and capabilities , new enemies , Cortana ( she looks sexy now ) , and overall gameplay . This game is a must play with a High-Definition Cable . This is my new favorite game along with Dark Souls and Dark Souls II .	1
Halo 4 is an awesome game and it shows no contest as a great game . 4 reasons why this game is good . 1 story , 2 characters , 3 controls & weapons , and lastly 4 music.Story : Four years after the events of Halo 3 , still floating in space , Forward Unto Dawn drifts towards Requiem . Cortana wakes Master Chief from cryonic sleep shortly before rogue Covenant forces board the vessel . The remnants of Dawn are caught in Requiem 's gravity well and pass through an opening on the planet 's surface to crash-land on its interior.As Chief and Cortana explore Requiem , fighting hostile Covenant and Prometheans , Cortana malfunctions . She reveals that she is past the usual operating period of an AI , and is becoming `` rampant '' , a declining mental state where AIs slowly `` think '' themselves to death . Chief promises to get Cortana to Earth , believing that Cortana 's creator , Doctor Catherine Halsey , can prevent or reverse Cortana 's condition.Chief and Cortana pick up garbled transmissions from a human ship , Infinity , who have picked up Dawn 's distress call . Cortana attempts to warn Infinity away from Requiem 's gravity well and directs the Chief to deactivate what she believes are communications jammers . Instead , Chief releases the Didact , an ancient Forerunner warrior , from imprisonment . The Didact takes control of the Prometheans and Covenant and attacks Infinity after it is dragged into Requiem.Chief makes contact with Infinity and brings the ship 's weapons back online to repulse the Didact 's attack . Chief and Cortana recommend attacking the Didact while he is vulnerable , but Infinity captain Del Rio orders them to destroy the gravity well so the ship can escape . In the process , Chief is contacted by a Forerunner known as the Librarian ; the wife of the Didact , as well as ancient humanity 's protector . She explains that the Forerunners were split on how to combat the Flood . After failing to discover a way to immunize biological beings from the parasite , the Didact used a device called the Composer to convert the warriors under his command into digital versions immune to infection . Requiring more soldiers , the Didact forcibly converted captured humans into Prometheans , before being stopped and imprisoned by the Librarian . The Librarian , who has guided humanity 's development , accelerates the Chief 's evolution ; this grants him immunity to the Composer . After destroying the gravity well , Del Rio orders a retreat back to Earth , doubting the Chief and Cortana 's testimony . The Master Chief disobeys orders to stand down and relinquish the malfunctioning Cortana , and stays behind to oppose the Didact . Infinity XO Commander Lasky gives Chief an armed transport and wishes him luck.Chief and Cortana attempt to sabotage the Didact 's ship before he leaves , but when they are unsuccessful they follow the Didact to a Halo ring , Installation 03 . The Composer has been moved from the ring onto the nearby Ivanoff Research Station , which the Covenant attack . The Chief defends Ivanoff , but the Didact retrieves the Composer and uses it on the station , composing every individual except the Chief . Chief and Cortana use a fighter to follow the Didact 's ship through slipspace towards Earth . Aided by Infinity and the UNSC home fleet , the Chief boards the Didact 's ship with a nuclear warhead . Cortana inserts copies of herself into the Didact 's computer systems to overwhelm the Didact 's shield , but not before the Didact directs the Composer at Earth . With the help of Cortana , the Chief defeats the Didact , who falls into a slipspace corridor generated underneath the Composer.Chief detonates the bomb , and finds himself in a blue realm where Cortana appears . She explains they were successful in stopping the Composer and that she saved Chief from the blast , although she can not return with him . Cortana touches Chief 's armor , backs away and disappears ; the Master Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back to Infinity , where he , mourning the loss of Cortana , talks with Lasky about Earth , duty , and what his duty as a soldier means . Lasky repeats something Cortana said earlier about not being just a machine driven by duty to protect humanity.In a post-credits cutscene , UNSC forces descend on the city of New Phoenix , the location the Didact used the Composer on , to find its inhabitants dead . In a narration , the Didact proclaims the Forerunner 's role as custodians of the galaxy having to bear The Mantle of Responsibility , and humanity as the greatest threat in the galaxy . Master Chief removes his armor aboard Infinity ; if the player completes the game on Legendary difficulty , the Chief 's eyes are briefly shown.the characters are well designed and voice acting really shows greatness new enemies , old enemies , and lots of character development.Master chief is the same voice actor thats awesome same with cortana before her utter demise.the control is amasing the control shows the improvement with this game and it 's awesome.Weapons : the weapons have improved or have been customized . thats saying alotmusic : Music is great with a little halo theme music outside installation 03 though i would have a little longer Halo theme.There 's terminals just like in Halo 3 and the Halo Combat evolved annivarsary these terminals give back story on the forerunners and the Halo rings also the flood . if you have played the other Halo games then this game should be a cake walk if you just started with this one and have n't played the other games the first terminal will give insight on Master chiefs adventures in the previous Halo games its located n the first misson Under master chiefs cryo pod.Story 5/5Characters 5/5Controls 5/5Weapons 5/5Music 5/5total 10/10 = A+This game is great and I ca n't wait for Halo 5 and Halo 6 .	1
I am a big fan of halo games . It is definitely worth buying . The service was amazingly fast and great .	1
Great to be back in Master Cheif 's shoes . Story is one of the best of 2012 and multiplayer is good also .	1
since how many modders and hacks are on multiplayer is irrelevant to the product itself i will have to rate it five stars , the real cheat about it is that they count two videos as levels to pad the campaign level count and you can finish the game in like 6 hours maybe less depending on the difficulty you chose , the real meat of the game really is in the spartan ops witch is multiplayer co op up to 4 people . at the moment xbox live is having so many issues with lag that theres just no way to play multiplayer without being screwed by everyone . anyways its a good game and fun too .	1
Got it , love it.Multiplayer finally sucked it up and added pre-game loadouts.I find if you struggled at all in the past with multiplayer , you 'll probably do well with this one.Starting out with DMR 's and BR 's , etc is pretty legit.Campaign is great too.I split most of my gaming time between Halo and Black Ops 2 now .	1
This game is awesome ! Great graphics great story line and great multiplayer ! ! ! ! If you have never played a halo game like me , then try this one ! Its awesome ! ! ! ! !	1
Excellent Game . I like it a lot and the multiplayer is really enjoying . Now is more cheaper than before !	1
When it was announce that Bungie was leaving the Halo franchise in the hands of newcomer 343 , some were worried about Halo 's future . I , for one , was n't really that hyped for Halo 4 , and was n't awaiting it 's release with any real anticipation . Now that it 's out , however , I 've had a chance to get my hands on the game , and I can honestly say it 's an amazing first effort from 343 , and one of the best games of 2012.GAMEPLAYIn my mind ( and I hope the minds of many Halo fans ) what makes Halo so great is the solid gameplay . When I think of Halo , I think of precise , responsive controls . It 's been this way since Halo 1 , and Halo 4 is no exception . The first thing I noticed about Halo 4 was that it `` felt '' like a Halo game . Movement , jumping , aiming , shooting and driving all feel perfect.Like previous Halo games , Halo 4 's campaign has a good amount of variety to keep the shooting from getting stale . The weapons , enemies , and armor abilities all keep the game interesting , and just when it feels like the shooting is about to get monotonous , the game will throw a driving section to change it up.The Covenant return for Halo 4 , and they act just like in previous games . Their presence keeps Halo 4 `` feeling '' like a Halo game , but to keep it from feeling old , Halo 4 also introduces a new enemy , the Prometheans . They act different than the Covenant , and will require you to change your battlefield tactics . They are a very welcome addition and prevent Halo 4 from feeling like a rehash of the same old game.GRAPHICSHalo 4 looks great . Some have said it 's the best looking Xbox 360 game yet , but I do n't know if I 'd agree with that . I will say it is the best looking Halo game yet , and certainly stands among the top tier of 360 games . Geometry is higher than ever , textures looks crisp ( with some super rare exceptions ) , and the lighting is better than ever . They 've added lens flare and bloom lighting ( which I 'm sure some gamers will complain about ) and a whole bunch of new effect that make the game look more real than ever . The animation ( especially for faces ) is also more detailed than ever and is really impressive.The look of the game has been tweaked somewhat . The UNSC ships and uniforms have been redesigned and look a little less military and a little more sci-fi . The Covenant troops and ships have been redesigned as well , and it 's a bit odd at first . It does n't hurt the game in any way , but for those long time fans ( such as myself ) who are used to the look of previous Halo games , it takes some getting used to . The new Promethean enemies and architecture look great and are very well designed , and fit well into the Halo universe . Overall , I like the aesthetic changes to Halo 4 , as it helps the new game ( and the new studio ) distinguish itself.SOUNDThe music for Halo 4 is a big departure from the previous games . It 's great music , but it 's quite different . The music is still orchestral , but the Halo theme music we 've all grown to love is absent . The new music works well with the new game , but so far it has n't been memorable like the soundtrack for Halo 3.Sound effects have also been completely re-done . The new sound effects are great , they have a very full sound to them and every weapon and blast sounds devastating . Enemies sound ferocious and intimidating , and vehicles sound powerful . Although everything sounds different , it still sounds appropriate and works well in the new game.STORYHalo 4 's campaign has a good story . Some have hailed it as the best Halo story yet , but I would n't agree with that . The story ( like the previous games ) often feels like Cortana telling you to go here and there , and you follow waypoints until another cutscene plays . Most cutscenes consist of characters telling you they 're under attack and then you have to go kill things . Toward the end more important story points are revealed , but for the majority of the game it 's pretty basic . It 's not bad , just nothing really complex or intriguing.MULTIPLAYERHalo 4 has changed multiplayer in several ways , most notably the new perks system . You can tell it was inspired by Call of Duty , but fortunately it does n't feel out of place . The thing that makes Halo different from CoD is the pacing . CoD is frantic and chaotic , but Halo has a tactical feel . What weapons you choose and what armor abilities you use are will have a big impact on how you play , and taking into account your shields and your enemies ' shields is key . I 'm not a huge fan of multiplayer ( in Halo or any game ) , but I 've played enough of it to know that Halo 4 does not feel like CoD as some reviewers on here have claimed . Halo 4 's multiplayer still feels like a Halo game through and through.CLOSINGHalo 4 has changed in a lot of ways . The enemies are different , the aesthetics have been re-designed , and the music has a different vibe . But Halo 4 keep intact the areas that matter most : The gameplay and the feel . As a longtime fan of Halo who was getting burnt out on Halo games after Reach , I am impressed with the way 343 has breathed new life into the franchise . And most importantly , the whole time I was playing I was having a great time .	1
Of course it is a great thing to buy it was for my kids and they will love it more then anything for the next month or so and then want something else .	1
I dont know how 343 Studios made the graphics look so great . I dont play multiplayer too much , I 'm a cod guy , but Halo Co Op Campaign is great .	1
I 've loved Halo ever since it first debuted . This installment does n't disappoint in terms of story . Its original and deeper than previous Halos -- sad , but good . ( Cortana is dying ) There are a few things that are confusing in the end , but I wo n't give that away . The Chief is more humanized in this storyline . He 's also a bit more chatty than in previous titles . Spartan Ops replaces Fire Fight and is more functional as a campaign for your own Spartan you create ! This was a really good move on 343 's part as it makes for more replay value.The Forerunner weapons tier has been added to make for a 3rd type of weapon system . Some have alternate weapon fire modes that increase the impact of the weapon . It may just be my imagination , but the light-based weapons in Halo 4 seem a little slow somehow , but still useful . Having said that , it may be the fact I have a DSL modem connection and not a fiber-optic that makes on-line play drop frames on occasion . Its more noticeable in split-screen than when playing alone but it is there . If you have lightning-fast internet at your location you can really make full use of Halo 4 's online capabilities . Otherwise , it may be a bit frustrating while battling in the online arena . If anyone else has experienced this , I 'd like to hear from you .	1
This game is super fun . The campaign map is amazing , and the new guns are spectacular . The fact that the master chief has been living in space for four years is an exciting start to an epic story.Halo is a Xbox game that requires the player to defeat enemies to get to a checkpoint and to do this without getting killed . You play as the master chief and as the game goes along , you discover new things about people and you discover new enemies and villains you have to defeat . Your main objective in Halo four is to kill the prometheans before they kill you.My experience with this game is awesome . I enjoy all of the Halos and I know that this is one of the best . It is super amazing and close to being perfect . My dad and I have loved this game forever , and we have been waiting for this game to come out . I would recommend this game to whomever is looking for something challenging to do.I would compare this game to Call of Duty . The thing that makes Halo better than Call of Duty is that Halo 's story has tied into everyone of its games , where Call of Duty on the other hand , you do n't know what 's coming next . Some things about Halo that are n't so great is that it is dark in some places , and the Promethean Knights are hard to kill . Other than that I think that the game is perfect.So I know that this game is wonderful and is close to being perfect . The best halo yet .	1
I am one of the 11 year played/read everything Halo veterans . I have beaten the campaign on Heroic and currently playing it on Legendary.Campaign : So first thing this campaign is top notch . It is definitely Halo quality . There is a great story here ( you have to watch the terminal stories in Waypoint ) . The new enemies are a great change of pace and something I think was needed . 343 also did a good job of capturing some of the old Halo feel . The level you are riding along with a giant vehicle is one of my favorites . I dont really want to give away much but it is definitely a worthwhile campaign . I cant say it is the best one of all time . First off being that it is a shorter campaign . Dont expect Halo 3 or Reach length of a campaign . Also this is not a difficult campaign . There are a couple of difficulty spike points especially when they throw multiple Knights at you but other then that it is smooth sailing . There are other things i can say but I wont go into such a deep comparison ... Just know that this campaign is worth playing and a good start to a trilogy.Spec ops : Umm saying it short . This is kind of a waste of time . The 5 very very short episodes add nothing to the game . They are kind of fun but i beat all of them in under an hour playing coop on heroic . Maybe after they are all out there will be some good content but for now Firefight was a much better option.Mulitplayer : more detailedOk so this is where my review moves from being a 5 star to being a 4 star review . I will be playing the multiplayer over the next 2 weeks and if my view changes then I will definitely update my score to a 5 for this game ... So first impression.. This is not Halo as it has been . That can be good or bad for you . This game has some of the same qualities of Halo but it is no were near as well made as the previous games high standards . High standars being Halo 3 if you dont like AA 's or Halo : Reach if you do . This game has mixed in way to much Call of Duty . Halo is built on the balance of shields to weapons and the trinity of gun , grenade and melee . Halo 4 breaks this to become more dumbed down . Yes there are a bunch of unlockables but most of them we just automatically got in Reach . So it is a false level system in that sense . Plus there are perks like unlimited sprint or faster recharging shields . That breaks the Halo mold . Now some of my bigger complaints . Loadouts I do not like because they take away a fundamental element of Halo . Finding and picking up other guns . Yes there are power weapon drops but THEY SHOW YOU WHERE THEY ARE ! stupid . Flaw of the game , if I have a DMR and a Pistol and now I need a Plasma pistol to take out this annoying Ghost . Guess what.. I cant unless I die and change my loadout . Another complaint 343 has basically now given me 2 armor abilities that I have to fit on this controller with all the other buttons but I still cant set up my controler exactly how I want it . I have always been able to find a control set up that I like but I am coming up short so far in Halo 4 . Also the hit boxes in this game are ridiculous . I am getting headshots with the pistol without even trying . If i am aimed anywhere near the other players head ... gameover ... Ok so I could keep going but I will just say one other thing . From what I can tell so far the melee combat impact in this game has been taken away quite a bit . I could be wrong so let me know if you see it diferently but I dont have to worry about people getting close to me in this game . The melee does not lunge forward like it use to so I dont worry about people trying to get that last hit and I dont use it as much . It is kind of sad because it takes that aggressive play out and changes the Halo game . I could be wrong on this and will update over the next few weeks.Closing : Fantastic campaign and well worth playing for anyone . More casual multiplayer aspect that I am not a huge fan of so far . Halo has always been my preference but so far it would not pull me from other mp games.Let me know if you have any constructive feedback ! Update : Campaign : So I finished the game on Legendary . More challenging but still not difficult . So I have noticed a few more things now . This game is still fun but really lacking in `` Halo '' moments . There is nothing that stands out . There is no `` Last night of solace '' or the last stand level of Reach . There is no massive vehicle level or overarching story like in halo 3 . There is no detective element with multiple stories coming together in the end like ODST . This game has a blandness to it . The enemies are way underdeveloped , the music is under par comparitively and sound effects are just ok . The game is like the chief is made out to be `` Robotic '' and like Cortana it is losing itself . In this case the heart of Halo . I am not going to knock it down any further in stars because it is good enough to be 4 stars but never 5 . Not by a long shot.Multi : coming soon.. still not the same as before . Nades and melee are weak .	1
This series just keeps getting better and better . Only a turd would n't like it . The game delivers fast action and a deep storyline like the original trilogy .	1
Love the single and multi player . If you like Halo and / or FPS ( COD , BF , etc ) , this is a great purchase !	1
343 Studios took over the Halo franchise , i was a little nervous about it but what came out of it was a great new game with a challenging new campaign and bad guys to take care of .	1
The graphics are great , cept master chief 's armor looks different , which makes no sense storyline wise.The Story is very anime-ish , it feels like a Halo fan-fiction instead of a Halo video game . It has some really cool moments but most of the game you 'll be scratching your head and wondering where all the fun went.Very Retcon-ny , and does a poor job of incorporating the story from earlier games.Controls are tight and multiplayer , though very differently organized , plays the same as Reach . Though I did n't like the overly complex customization in reach and its back but worse in this game . Non of the multiplayer armors look like spartans . Everything is just a jumbled mash of metal and glass . Lacks the artfulness of Halo 3 's simple armor permutations.The stupid Cr currency is gone , thank goodness.Strange side note : Nearly every sound effect is different . While the sounds varied from game to game , the guns and vehicles do not sound at all like they did before . In my opinion this hurts the game as it makes it feel farther removed from the original halo games.Conclusion : If you liked Reach more than Halo 3 and Halo 2 , you 'll like this game . Unfortunately , I did n't really like reach . However , this game is still king when it comes to tight gameplay and addicting gametypes . If you buy for story , you might be disappointed , but those buying for the multiplayer only with be satisfied .	1
Great game from what I 've played . I 'm about 75 % through the game and have enjoyed every minute of it . After the first 3 Halo 's I 've been a bit late to the party on the last few , but I have to say that this is one of my favorites.Unlike most , I do not buy Halo for the multi-player anymore . I bought this for the campaign and I 'm very happy with it . Ca n't wait to see what 343 do on the Xbox One .	1
pros : -amazing game love the whole halo storyline 1-4 though have n't played reach or wars-packaging was great-mutli player is awesomecons : -only thing for me is the ending some people are ehhh but i hated it but i guess it had to happen in order for them to keep on making the next halo 5	1
I 'm not necessarily reviewing the content of the game ( I did enjoy it thoroughly ) , I 'm more reviewing the overall experience purchasing this item used from an independent seller . It was shipped quickly , packaged nicely , and plays perfectly.As far as the game in concerned , it is a high production value FPS with a solid campaign , fun multiplayer , and great story . If you have n't played Halo 4 yet and you 're a fan of FPS ( or just good games in general ) pick this up on the cheap and have a great weekend with it .	1
No Bungie , not a problem because Halo has been taken in a slightly new direction and is beyond amazing . Halo 4 is without a doubt the finest installment into the series . Multiplayer at its best , stunning graphics , super sound quality , smarter A.I . and many ways to play and further explore the Halo universe , what more can any fps fan ask for . Im not going to spoil this for any fan new or old but I will say the samething that I said a few years ago , as long as fans still love the series then Microsoft will always put out great Halo titles for there systems including Halo 4 . For those older fans such as myself , I knew Halo 3 wouldnt be the end of Master Chief and here we are many years after the first Halo and it is still one of the biggest selling video game franchises that has ever been made . Dont believe me then pick up Halo 4 and expierence the greatness that awaits you .	1
at the end of halo 3 when master chief told cortana to `` wake me ..when you need me '' it signified the end of a fantastic trilogy in gaming and pop culture history..but we all knew that the chief would come back sometime ... because well , hes just too cool to never hear from again..when it was announced that bungie would not be doing another halo game after halo reach..fans ( myself included ) was concerned..but 343 studios knew what they had here and treated the halo universe with respect..and now we have the start of a new chapter in the chiefs adventures..picking up 4 years later after the events in halo 3 the chief is still in cryosleep abord the ship `` forward unto dawn '' where something goes wrong..cortana is activated wondering what to do ..she takes action..the cryo tube opens.. and let the fun begin ! the graphics in halo 4 are outstanding..and they really push the xbox 360 to the limit and then some ... for example.. the prologue where dr halsey is being questioned about why the spartans were really created and we see john117 ( thats the chief to you newbies ) as a child being adapted into the program ... .well , its almost lifelife ! top notch graphics rendering ... proving once again why the xbox 360 is still a force to be delt with ... the gameplay here is the same as you know and love..no big changes..which is a good thing..I got this on christmas morning and 10 minutes later im blasting my way out of the forward unto dawn.. later on you 'll get new weapons also..some that will take a few to get used to.. but everything else that you love about the halo saga is here..from engaging characters to kick ass weapons to the master chief himself ... its all here.we also meet a new threat..one thats a bit more hostile than the covenant ever was..bottom line halo 4 is worth picking up.. this is THE game of the year for the 360..i havent had the chance of going online to try the spartan ops or multiplayer as of yet because im still enjoying the single player mode..but i will shortly.. : ) Bring on halo 5	1
It is a known fact that behind a great game there 's a great group of developers who work hard in order to make games look good and awesome not only in the gameplay mode or graphics but also in the way the story or the game itself makes you feel ( Assassin 's Creed III would be my finest example of that ) . Well , without Bungie around to take care of business with Halo 4 , the game turned out to be fun but hollow in many other aspects.343 induestries tried hard ( that 's an obvious statement when you look at the game ) to make this game great and big but , unfortunely it seems that while they were worried about how a Halo game should be , they missed essential features of the Halo series to include in this one . The graphics to start with are just ok but not `` Halo great '' as we ( the fans ) were used to since the awesome Halo 3 or even Reach . For some reason this game looks patched in that matter . On the other hand , the sound of the guns are pretty weak too . A Halo game must make you feel the adrenaline while you 're pulling the trigger on shotguns , machine guns and even on a magnum but honestly , this is not seen in Halo 4 , I mean , the sensation of a Halo game is just not there anymore . By moments I feel like I 'm playing a old version of Halo from the previous XBOX console ( the one before 360 kicked in ) and that 's a shame because I had some good expectations about the game but unfortunely it did n't meet most of them.On the bright side , I feel that the story is good and the gameplay is still fun but I would 've prefered getting a game that it did n't remind me to Call of Duty.I know I 'm going to play this game until I finish with it but after that I really doubt that I would feel in the mood to play it again . My personal advice to the people for 343 industries is that if they 're planning on releasing a Halo 5 or 6 in the future they must work harder ... . way harder in graphics and sounds because Halo 4 should be considered as their lesson on how a `` Halo '' game is not meant to be.Additional comments : After playing the whole campaign I must say that I was wrong about my ratIng of the game . Although I still think that the graphics and the weapon sounds could 've been better , the campaign gets more exciting as you move forward . I guess the first couple of stages are n't as exciting as the rest of them . Also the story gets more and more interesting as well . This is the reason why I changed my mind about the rating . Bungie might not be around anymore but the fun is still there : )	1
There are a lot of reviews for this game and a lot of opinions so I will just lay out a couple basic things on what I thought of this game.The multiplayer is a lot of fun , it feels more like Halo 3 than Halo Reach which I think pleased a lot of fans . I love the new weapons like the saw and railgun but am disappointed the revenant from Halo Reach was removed . Its also great that being able to run is something you can do anytime instead of having it be a specific ability that must be chosen over other better abilities . The campaign was quite fun and what I would have expected from a Halo . I love spartan ops , and I understand that it was meant to remove firefight , but I still miss firefight from Halo Reach.Overall a good game . I only have one major complaint that really pisses me off : what 343 is doing with the weekly gametype changes . You 're telling me that one week I can play team snipers and the next week the gametype is nonexistent ! ? Seriously WTF ! ! ! ! Why ca n't you just leave all the game types up all the time ! Why would you remove any ! ?	1
I was pleased with the game , although I still feel Halo Reach is the best of the series . This will definitely take us on a new path as Master Chief for the future . I do wish there were more maps for online play however .	1
A great addition to my gaming collection , you will enjoy all this game has to offer , the excitement that this game provides is so very amazing !	1
I will be brief.Great campaign , wicked new Promethean enemies , smooth solid online multi-player . I do n't need to say much else about it at this point , everyone else has already enlightened you as to what you are in for.Halo 4 is a fantastic game through and through , you really need to check it out and see if it fits your tastes or not . If your on the fence at the very least rent it , but I can safely recommend this to almost anyone who likes the FPS genre and has a LIVE account .	1
Personally , the best game ever . This game is so alike the first one or the & # 34 ; Halo Aniversary & # 34 ; in so many aspects and of course : & # 34 ; CORTANA & # 34 ; . Halo fans and also shooter games fans will love this game . The graphic details , the locations , the armor , the story , the arsenal , everything , everything is just amazin . Just run and get one .	1
Wow what can I say about this game ? Perfection . The campaign is simply amazing and I enjoyed playing co-op as well . The multiplayer is awesome too , especially that one can have 'ordinance ' based on how many kills one gets that 's a plus . Another cool thing is the episodes that one has to do in order to get a new story . All in all , Great job 343 industries . You showed off with this game . 10/10 .	1
I was skeptical when news broke of Bungie handing over the reigns of my favorite game of all time . But 343 did an AMAZING job with Halo 4 . The campaign is an epic continuation of Halo 3 and comes packed with great gameplay and thought-provoking cinematics . The multiplayer is really legit . The mechanics , both in-game and in matchmaking lobby , have improved drastically from previous games . I was a huge fan of Team Swat and played it almost exclusively in previous games . I was saddened when Team Swat did n't appear on the game menu , but had a round with Infinity Slayer and I am hooked . Overall , Halo 4 is a great game and I highly recommend !	1
I still am getting used to playing this on heroic.I do not know if it is just because I have become rusty with Halo or the new producers of the game wanted to put their own spin on it . The shield becomes depleted INSANELY quickly when in a fire fight to the point that its annoying and even though you can now & # 34 ; sprint & # 34 ; you can never really close on any enemies well . I still will always like 3 and CE the best I think but I am and always will be a fan of the series .	1
I jumped onto the Halo band wagon late in the game.. I was a nintendo fan boy but ever since i started i loved it.This one is no different . Even by another studio the bar is raised.. you 'd swear it was running on a next gen hardware.highly recommended to any fan of scifi , shooters , or halo..	1
I love Halo 4 , always have been a fan of the Halo legacy . This particular game is awesome when it comes to online gaming . 343 impressed me with its smooth , futuristic design and gaming experience . Ca n't wait for Halo 5 to come out !	1
it was exactly what i wanted and i would recommend it to any one who is looking for a fun game to play on x box 360	1
It 's been two years since Bungie 's final incarnation of Halo was released and a new developer - 343 Industries was given the task of advancing this series to the future . A few brand new weapons have been added , an entirely redesigned multiplayer system , a new type of co-op called Spartan Ops and the return of the Master Chief . This review is heavily weighted towards the three main sections : Multiplayer , Spartan Ops and CampaignShort ReviewCampaign ( gameplay portion ) 6 of 10 - a few new enemies and vehicles , unfortunately somewhat repetitive and closer to Halo 2 style of gameplay , has glitch issuesStory 8 of 10 - resuscitates a long dead storyline and breathes new life into it with new characters , the emergence of the Prometheans and the Didact , somewhat difficult followWeapons 7 of 10 - old weapons have been adjusted with less recoil , stronger assault rifle , new weapons like sticky detonator and railgun change it up , not many truly new ones thoughEnemies 6 of 10 - Prometheans and their hounds are new and difficult in tandem , however all Covenant are now far less intelligent , essentially five types of enemies overallGraphics 6 of 10 - graphics on the whole look pretty good with dynamic light and shading as well as very smooth animation/physics , but textures look chunky and grainyMultiplayer 9 of 10 - now able to actually gain abilities , always have sprint , loadouts available as well as weapon drops for killing sprees , very similar to CoD , lost old UNSC ranksSpartan Ops 8 of 10 - new episodes added every week , objective based co-op separate from campaign really changes it up from firefight , and everything carries over from multiplayer to hereCharacter Development 9 of 10 - all armor adjustments carry over from Reach , loadouts , decreased reloading times , infinite sprint , increased grenade damage , some grindingCampaign 6 of 10As a decade long Halo player I can safely say I 've played through all the games produced by Bungie at least five times through . And this one is right about at Halo 2 levels of refinement in terms of overall gameplay and intrigue . The story sets it apart and really allows some issues to go overlooked . However , at its best you feel as though you 've stepped back in time and are now playing a game that is nostalgic , as if to say `` wow , remember when ? '' But , by the end of the game you feel the repetitiveness start to creep in . The routine seems to follow the blow up four of these generators , press three of these buttons system which is obvious on a second play through . On the whole , it plays more like a 10 hour cinematic than it does a quality game . I 'd love to see the movie these guys could make though . It does feel much larger and epic than previous games . However , there is considerable dead time and the dynamic enemies are few and far between . You have essentially five main types of enemies : Elites , Grunts , Jackals , Prometheans ( forerunners ) and Promethean Hounds . That 's essentially it . By the third level you 've already reached every type of enemy . It gets old , quick.For those who will remember , this will appear as an amalgamation of all previous Halo games . It has the extras from Reach , as well as some of its weapons . It looks like Halo 2 . It has the architecture and setup from Halo CE . And it basically plays like Halo 3 . This makes sense because chronologically it is the next step . Going along with the issue of the monotony , you have basically no replay value here . The reason I say this is absolutely nothing carries over from the campaign . You do n't get commendations , credits ( without challenges ) , armor or loadouts for the campaign . What 's my motivation to replay this game again 343 ? It 's also somewhat less difficult than previous games . Heroic feels more like normal , Normal feels like easy and I have n't tried easy . This is not a problem for me but it 's something to note . On the whole , I feel like the campaign kind of took a nose dive for extra multiplayer development and we were cheated out of a quality fifth Halo campaign.Story 8 of 10When I first found out they were going to make a Halo 4 I scoffed at the possibility that they could continue a decrepit storyline . But they somehow managed to pull me back in . You feel for the people and the Chief . I think it was the fact that they relied more on the Halo books here than in previous games . It 's still lacking in info , but this is made for gamers . The game starts out with Master Chief in the old Hyper sleep chamber in the middle of deep space on a ship going down , sound familiar ? Cortana is quickly determined to have begun something called rampancy where her AI has begun to degenerate . They 're being sucked into a Forerunner world . Without giving away too much , they 've found the original species that created the Halos and guess who has to fight them . My only real issue with the story is its somewhat hard to follow even watching all of the cut-scenes I still had questions . It 's probably the best story I 've yet seen in a Halo game however.Weapons 7 of 10Most of the weapons in the game were overhauled , for example the Assault Rifle actually does do damage now . The DMR has less recoil and the Needler is quicker and useful again . But for the most part few truly new weapons were added . There are a number of new weapons , but if you take a second look at them , they 're replacements for previous weapons . All the Promethean weapons are just human weapons with a different type of ammo . Everything else is negligible . The only truly new weapons ( that are n't copies ) are the Storm Rifle , SAW Rifle , Promethean Energy Rocket ( or something ) , Promethean Grenade , Sticky Detonator and Railgun . The Storm Rifle is a covenant assault rifle . The Promethean Energy Rocket is a slow version of the rocket launcher . The Promethean grenade is for all intents and purposes trash . Its area of effect is about eight feet and it does little but stagger all but the daftest of enemies . The SAW is just a full blown light machine gun , but surprisingly not that powerful . The sticky detonator is a weapon which you can fire at an enemy and then it sticks to that spot allowing you to detonate it at a later point . It 's actually pretty helpful later on in the game . The Railgun is a weapon that has to be charged but is a one hit kill if you get close enough - essentially a supercharged shotgun . What was bothersome in this game is halfway through you were almost forced to use the Promethean weapons the majority of the time . And they just do n't really impress me.Enemies 6 of 10It 's pretty obvious 343 was `` dumbing '' down the covenant to make the Prometheans seem more fearsome and I just found the Prometheans to be annoying instead of challenging . I can see how they would be challenging however . They have a flying machine they house in their back which comes out and either acts as a turret or produces a shield for them . They can teleport pretty quickly to where you 're at - especially the orange ( higher level ) Prometheans as well as return your grenades . And you ca n't melee them as far as I can tell . You do have to spend some time playing against them to understand their weaknesses . The Covenant on the other hand are nearly worthless by comparison . The grunts as usual are grunts . The jackals are about as difficult as before . The Elites seem very slow to react and ca n't seem to throw the grenades far enough . They also go down pretty easily.Graphics and Presentation 6 of 10Many have said that the textures look cheapened and have actually taken a step back compared to Halo : Reach . This is true in quite a few cases , mostly evident on the Master Chief 's armor . It feels more realistic in its presentation however such as animation , sounds and shading . Most of weapons have been given new sounds as well as all the vehicles . And , for the first time you feel as though you ARE the Master Chief . And the FMV cut-scenes are magnificent . The beginning cut-scene could be a trailer for a movie it was so life like . It was the first time I truly confused one with a real face . Unfortunately , many of the textures later on in the game are quite lacking in refinement and overall appearance . They 're far more reminiscent of Halo 2 than a game from 2012 . I ca n't tell if this was because of budgetary constraints , the fact that they were starting from scratch or that they felt it was n't necessary . In any case it 's hard to overlook after playing the game more than once . I , myself do n't feel terribly bothered by it , but from a blockbuster game you 'd expect better visuals.Multiplayer ( now War Games ) 9 of 10This is where the game really shines and the Call of Duty influence is more than evident . But , instead of being detrimental to the overall evolution of Halo it benefits the more skilled players . For example , when you get on a killing spree you 're able to do a weapons drop . You are able to also level your abilities benefiting people who are quality players . Yes , there are obvious grinding aspects , but really it does n't take much time to gain the XP and level the playing field . This can be discouraging to past Halo players because now tactics have to be used if you plan to win . Gone are the days where everyone lines up like the Civil War and shoots until one person dies . Another really interesting aspect is the loadouts which are also able to be leveled up . I , myself , have a DMR , Plasma Pistol and Plasma grenade with unlimited sprint and quicker reloads . It prevents the people who `` abuse '' the vehicles from running a map , so to speak . I 'm able to quickly disable any vehicle . In the past , I needed to look for a plasma pistol , plasma grenades and hang back to make sure I did n't lose these items quick . And if you think about for a second , should n't you be rewarded for being good at the game ? Maps are all new aside from a carbon copy of Valhalla ( which is now named Ragnarok ) from Halo 3 . This is my favorite map on any game.Spartan Ops 8 of 10This is a new system in place of firefight . Instead of a `` defend until done '' type of mission its far more objective based and various in nature . For example , one of the Spartan Ops consists of protecting generators . But , it seems as though most are just secondary missions . I believe they are all also pieces of levels taken from the game . But this was the case in Reach as well . This is an interesting take on the co-op firefight overhaul . In general it 's somewhat less boring because they have a new set of missions each week . Now I do n't know how long this will continue or if it 's going to be something that 's updated each week . But it does add some level of variability for non-multiplayer gamers . Another really nice thing is that you do n't have to join a matchmade game . You can play by yourself or by up to four people on your box . This was the case before , but if you wanted credits in Reach you really had to join the four person firefight . Also , all credits , loadouts and armor carries between Spartan Ops and War Games.Character Development 9 of 10Armor is varied in type and you 're able to switch quite a few things after maybe 6-8 multiplayer games . As before all armor can be aesthetically adjusted . You get better armor abilities , tactic packages and increased damage from certain weapons . Yes , it 's VERY similar to Call of Duty . But , for some reason it just works better in a Halo multiplayer game . This is how the game should have been probably back in Halo 3 . I do n't know how many levels there are because they took away the actual ranks , replacing them with levels . It seems like there are probably 100 levels because I know many who are already SR60 . In essence , if you are a seasoned Halo veteran you 'll likely rise to the top pretty quickly . The additions may seem as though `` grinders '' are being given an unfair advantage . But , even if you 're a highly ranked , if you do n't know how to play or know the maps you 'll still die plenty.ConclusionTaking the campaign away I 'd rate this game 9 out of 10 . It really satisfies all of the issues I had with multiplayer and switches things up with the Spartan Ops . But there are some problems you just ca n't avoid . The pilots for the banshees routinely run into things . Gunners for your warthog will likely get you killed . In the case of the Mammoth level I was driving the warthog and he was destroying ghost after ghost and then all of a sudden he just stopped shooting . I had to retreat and he never did start shooting again . I mean these are really basic issues too . The weapons are maybe 10 % overall new weapons . Visuals are somewhat disappointing . And the campaign on the whole should never have been cut off from the XP . In multiplayer I 've already seen cases of lag cheating ( or he has the ability to teleport possibly ? ) . I have a T3 connection so it was n't me lagging . So there will have to be a few updates to the game.In conclusion , if you 're a Halo player who really likes the old way of playing where one person gets all the power weapons at the beginning and decimates your whole team you may want to rent this one . It does have many elements of Call of Duty and has evolved as a whole . There is grinding , but you get most of the worthwhile add-ons early in the rankings . I 've been playing Halo since 2002 and I can honestly say that as a classic style player I do like where multiplayer is going . If you 're solely a campaign guy/girl then you may want to steer clear . Being their first try , 343 has done not a bad job overall because you 've got to consider this a standalone game . I 'd give the game as a whole a 7 out of 10 .	1
it was better when bungie was doing halo . when 343 took it over the game aka microsoft . The game was kind of retarded in some spots . Id say halo 1 and 2 were the best . the game is alot harder and and sometimes gets boring . over all i enjoyed the game but i would n't play it again .	1
What else can i say its halo thats all anyone can say great fun game to have wroth every penny .	1
The campaign is very good , having very long missions and astounding graphics on the cut-scenes . Most of the missions are very different form each other , so you do n't feel bored.The online is very fast-paced and different from the other Halo games . It depends on your personal taste for the online gameplay , but they have a pretty good variety of playlists . The makers of the game ( 343 Industries ) update Halo 4 every week , whether it be new Spartan Ops missions or a new playlist in Matchmaking.5/5	1
The game does n't throw in a different story , it just makes the story curve a bit down the road.It keeps you on the ground with the halo universe you know , but changes it a bit.There is a hidden history that you can find , data files , and if you find them you will understand the forerunner story a bit more.The Graphics have been way improved , the CGs almost to real but they are awsome.You see both the Master Chief and Cortana as something more than a A.I . and a machine soldier.You see a different side to them , see what happens to them through the game and how they change.You see the human side of the Chief , and how he reacts to Cortana.343 put in a lot of effort and thought into this , the design , the characters , the CG , and everything else.So it would be a crime not to play this game , the torch has been passed and the fires are burning bright for the Halo universe .	1
Wow , normally when a different developer takes over a AAA Franchise ( or any franchise ) you could end up with a disaster . This is not the case with Halo 4.Concept : 10/10Create another Halo game with more focus on the Master Chief and Cortana and add a new Alien Race complete with an arsenal of new weapon types . They pulled this off beautifully . Add a ton of Multiplayer Modes , too.Story : 9/10For the first time we get a real look at the background of the Master Chief . If you 're a die hard Halo fan , you already know that the government kidnapped children and raised / engineered them as supersoldiers . These people have no conscience and are sociopaths . If you think about it , the Master Chief has killed thousands of enemies and he does n't lose any sleep over it . These Spartans are paired up with an AI . The Master Chief has always had Cortana . She 's guides him through the missions and acts as a link to his humanity . The story focuses on their relationship as they encounter a new alien threat to the human race . This is the most `` human story '' the Halo series has ever had.Graphics : 10/10Halo has never looked better ! The characters are more detailed , there are more FX , and the environments are HUGE , which usually translates to EPIC ! Gameplay : 9/10The gameplay is very well paced where you trade off from infantry battles , vehicle battles , air battles , etc . Many of the encounters give you great weapons AND vehicles and it 's up to you to complete it any way you want . This works exceptionally well with their Co-Op system . Halo 4 also includes 4 difficulty levels and their Skulls System , which allows you to Turn On specific difficulty features . For example : Enemies have more Health , Enemies drop less Ammo , Enemies are more resistant to some damage , and less resistant to others ... There are so many options to play through the campaign.Multiplayer : 10/10It 's Halo Multiplayer with everything that you 'd expect from the franchise . You have the campaign options , Spartan Ops , which are missions designed for Co-op Play , and a ton of Competitive Modes . It 's just about everything that you 'd want.Replay Value : 10/10With so many ways to play through the Campaign and a variety of Multiplayer Modes , you could play Halo 4 for months . Play with your friends , play against your enemies , play on different difficulties with skulls turned on to test your skills ... Maturity : TeensThe Halo Franchise is always rated M because when Halo 1 came out , congress was freaking out about sniping in games and head shots . This is just a sci-fi adventure where you kill aliens with laser guns . There 's no sex or swearing ... There are a few cinematic deaths , but it 's no more violent than the stuff on TV . If this was a movie , it would be PG-13.Overall : 10/10This may be my favorite Halo game . With a human story , beautiful graphics , smooth gameplay , and epic missions , it 's definitely a GREAT addition to the franchise . This is a must buy for fans of the series or fans of the FPS genre . If you shop around , you can get it for $ 39.99 , too.Buy it if you love Halo.Buy it if you love FPS games.Buy it if you love Epic Sci-Fi.Buy it if you will play the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you just want to blow through the 8 hour campaign and play through the story.Avoid this game if ... umm ... I ca n't think of a reason other than not liking the genre .	1
I 'm a huge Gears of War fan & i needed a small break so i tried Halo 4 out . I played some Reach & i actually got kinda bored with it really quick but now Halo 4 WOW . powering up & customizing on this is so good . you can choose your color your stance your loadouts ... its all set up very slick . another feature i am enjoying is theater mode , where i can replay some funny fights . GOOD TIMES ! ! ! I played some campaign but to me online is where the fun is .	1
I was skeptical , like most , about buying this game . 1 , because it was made by a new developer and 2 , Halo 2 AND 3 was a disappointment for me . I did n't like Halo 2 at all and Halo 3 , although better than 2 , did not live up to the expectations of the very first Halo which by far is the best Halo in my opinion.I read some reviews for Halo 4 and watched some gameplay footage of it on YT . It looked pretty good , but I still was n't sure . I could not rent the game because it would take FOREVER to become available so after a little bit of thought I decided to go to my local game store and plop down the $ 60 bucks it cost . I knew if the game sucked , I would never buy another Halo game again and I can just trade it in for credit and use that for Black ops 2 instead . It looks like I wo n't need to do that.This game is awesome . I really enjoyed it . Although , not to the level of gameplay enjoyment that Halo combat evolved had , its still better than 2 and 3 . I never played Reach so I ca n't compare.The story in this game is very good and so are the graphics . The guns are very nice to use and the controls are very smooth without that jaggyness I felt when I played Halo 2 . All of the games soundtrack is new but it fits well with the game . The sound effects are very nice and sounds so realistic . If you have surround sound , prepare to be blown away . The covenant look quite different in this version . The small ones do n't speak english anymore , or at least I could not hear it . The elite look much bigger than before and they too look quite different . Matter of fact the only covenant that looks similar to past Halo games are the Hunters.The new enemies they have , the Prometheans , are a much better enemy than the Brutes in my opinion and the weapons they have are awesome . Yes , you can pick them up and use them along with the Covenant weapons although the plasma rifle is not in this version . They have another plasma rifle that is bigger , but still fires automatic rounds.As I said earlier the graphics in this game are absolutely sickening . I did n't know the 360 still had the power to pull off graphics like this . They look very good and there is no frame slow down either . The colors they use are beautiful and the animations are very smooth and almost life like.I do n't want to reveal anything about the story , you just have to check the game out yourself . I recommend renting it first though . Even though I took a chance on this game , I am satisfied . It is worth my 60 bucks . I do n't play games online so I ca n't rate that feature . There is also a second disc with the game but I did n't get a chance to check that out either.343 is a good developer so far . I wonder what the next Halo game will be like on the next Xbox ... ...	1
Very good game sad that halo series is over had it since it came out play mp a lil beat campaign twice have n't played much lately now destiny that 's a game to look out for cant wait for it I 'm just mad at one thing they always said master chief was n't human but at the end of campaign it looks like he 's gon na show his face finally when there taking off his armour then screen fades to black damn they should of show us I wanted to see if its true that he was not a human and a alien race	1
I was playing the single player and whatever reason I some how got lost and couldnt find my way back to where I was supposed to go . Anyways I left and joined an online match and now I cant go back to the single player . The online is so much fun to play and In my eyes this is the best Halo I have played everyone with a 360 should pick this up .	1
Who would have ever thought that anyone could make a better Halo game than Bungie ? Certainly not me . When the franchise changed hands , I think we all just hoped that 343 did not screw it up . Then a miracle happened ... spurred on by a lot of blood , sweat , and tears at 343 , I am sure . Halo 4 came back better than ever ! I will start with what is bad about Halo 4 , because the list is very short . Basically , there are a few sections on 2 or 3 levels that seem like filler . Gameplay sections that just overstay their welcome because they are obviously there just to slow down your progression . Examples of this are when a lift you are riding on gets & # 34 ; shut down & # 34 ; both times you pass an adjacent structure . Forcing you to get off , fight to a lever , hit said lever , fight back to the lift , fight enemies now spawning on the lift , then proceed . Also , almost everything that you have to do in the game , whether it be activating something or deactivating something , is done in pairs rather than just once . Is this a huge issue ? Nope , not at all . Just the only thing I have to complain about.Now onto the great . Note : there is no good , only great ! The gameplay is as tight and precise as ever . The AI , for both enemy and friendly , is as great as it ever was , maybe even improved . The graphics are better than ever . The art design is better than ever . The levels are wonderfully done , directing you enough that you never get lost but open enough that you have tactical choices on how to approach combat . The soundtrack is excellent and it compliments the game perfectly . The voice acting could not have been any better , giving weight and emotion to the characters that was never there before . And the story ... Oh what a story . This is perhaps the BEST Halo story yet . ( I only say & # 34 ; perhaps & # 34 ; because Halo : Reach was also a great story . If you have not played Reach yet , pick that up too . ) The story is completely comprehensible . It is more intimate , because even though the backdrop is about a war for the survival of our race the real focus is on the relationship between John and Cortana . I wo n't get into the multiplayer . It may be great , but that is not where I spend my time . And I have not really spent much time in Spartan Ops yet . Point being , all those features are just bonuses to flesh out the package , add long-term playability , and give additional value . Without them , Halo 4 is still worth every penny . It has never been more enjoyable to fight as Master Chief than in Halo 4 , and Halo has never given given players a better reason to fight than this personal story .	1
Campaign : -Story was Great but the Campaign should have really explained the Halo universe more . I read all the books , and am familiar with the Halo canon so this was not a problem for me , but I could see how it would be very difficult for people to understand it without that knowledge , even having played all the games . Also , the terminal videos should be included as part of the campaign , not as extras because they explain a lot . The look of the game is simply beautifuly . It really mimics that feeling of wonder and exploration that was present in Halo : Combat Evolved . The enemies in campaign are unique and diverse , so fighting them always requires a strategy and not just spraying . The cutscenes are unreallisticly realistic ... They are simply amazing . Some of my friends thought they had used live-action , which is not true by the way , it is all CGI.Multiplayer : Multiplayer is the part where this game really stands out . From a competitive view , it is not too great , because of the random oridnace , but from just a `` fun '' point of view , it is AWESOME ! The randomness is actually fun , and provides a nice change of pace . The maps are all great , especially Ragnarok , the remake of Vallhalla . It is much faster paced by the way , but do n't worry , it 's still Halo.Spartan Ops : Dare I say it , but the story of Spartan Ops is actually better than the actual part where you play . I believe the story is actually better than campaign . It is very similar to Red Vs. Blue if you are familiaer with that . They have also been great about keeping up with releasing weekly content , and so far it 's been great . Season 1 is over , and Season 2 is confirmed.Forge : With the recent addition of the new map Forge Island , which in 100 % free by the way , Forge in Halo 4 is definatley something something unlike any forge before it . Definately would reccomend.This game is really great everywhere , except campaign needs improvement . I would definately reccomend getting this game .	1
This is an awesome game , I finally was able to view a video about from where Halo originated , so now I know who is master chief and the hole game makes a lot of sense , great graphics	1
Spartan 117 returns with vengeance and this time his mission is personal . As his AI who is his only friend suffers from rampancy , Chief wants to get her back to the scientist who made her to attempt to fix her . Upon awaking from deep sleep of roughly 4 years Master Chief stumbles upon an ancient evil with a long standing vendetta with mankind . As Master Chief races to save mankind and his AI he is faced with an new enemy.Halo 4 is an outstanding game and in almost all points improvements on Halo 3 and those who were released in between Halo 3 and Halo 4 . Featuring new weapons , enemies , and armor abilities to name a few . Halo 4 takes you on a ride that anyone who has played the prior games will enjoy and find tough to put down.The graphics are outstanding and i think are reaching the capabilities of our current consoles . I 'm still debating if some of the cut scenes are live action or extremely good animation . The in game graphics are about as good as it gets.The mechanics of the game are smooth as butter and really fluid . When you hit a button Chief does exactly what you want him to , there is n't any miscommunication in the game as to what you want the character to do . The control settings are set up for combat game play with fire , melee , and grenades at constant fingertips due to their position on the triggers and bumpers . There are also other control settings as to what buttons do what for those who like Call of Duty controls or the controls from older Halo games . The vehicle controls are well placed and simple to operate . Most of the vehicles have smooth operation and handle really well . The Scorpion tank can be a little tricky . While the controls are simple , the tank goes in whatever direction that the barrel points . However when your engaging hostiles at all angles and have the turret spinning around sending 90mm of love to your enemy and trying to stay mobile you can have some problems . That is because once the turret is facing what is considered the rear of the tank the directional controls change ( meaning the left , right , forwards , and backwards are reversed ) . If you keep this in mind then it wont effect you much.The Campaign : The campaign was near flawless the story was interesting and will keep you on the edge of your seat and focused on the story as you attempt to figure out this new hostile force . The campaign will certainly appeal to Halo fans who know the whole series . When playing Halo i connect with Chief in the way that he is the warrior who does what needs to be done no matter what the personal cost . What is perfect about the story is that it is a perfect length it is not exceptionally short and not exceptionally long . It is just long enough to be good and worth the money but short enough to not be so long that you feel that it 'll never end . Its in that butter zone . I would rather leave the campaign for the most part unsaid to avoid giving up any spoilers.Online Play : The online play has completely improved . For someone who has never really been good at Halo online due to the shields i have to say it is a good improvement over the past games and the online play has been leveled . The vehicles are evenly spaced and for the most part not extremely in your face . Maps are not filled with rockets or other heavy weapons . Many times the heavy weapons are attained from random ordinance drops a player earns from obtaining a certain amount of enemy kills . While weapons are placed on the maps they are not clustered or too powerful . However it may just be me and my questionable skill level with online play , it seems like there are some very powerful weapons people can spawn with . Halo allows you to select your load out consisting of several things , primary weapon , sidearm , grenades , and armor ability to name a few of your customizable options . Just like prior Halo games ( speaking of Reach specifically ) your armor is completely customizable . You service number ( clan tag ) and emblem are customizable as before however not much has changed with that and the options you have available to you are roughly the same as games of the past.Online includes multiple fun game types that just can not be replicated in a Call of Duty experience . Game types that are not solely team deathmatch . The game types offered in Halo will keep the player entertained with fun yet combat based play.Online also includes mini missions called Spartan Ops . In Spartan Ops you can play solo or with a friend on campaign type missions . The missions when on heroic or legendary are surprisingly difficult even when playing with friends who can pick up the slack and hold their own . The enemies will often outnumber you at least 10 to 1 and break threw your lines . Spartan Ops is Halo 's rendition of Call of Duty 's Spec Ops online game missions . The game type is enjoyable and challenging . Spartan Ops also allows you to use your online matchmaking load outs that you 've customized . Spartan Ops is enjoyable however there are not many missions . This could change with downloadable content in the future.As in Halo games before this there is still the options of Theater in which you can save snapshots or video of impressive/funny things that you did in online play . You can share snapshots of the game play with your friends . Also as in Halo games of the past forge is also still an option for those who will enjoy it.It should be noted that those who are not familiar with the story lines of the prior halo games will likely feel lost as the campaign progresses . As with many halo games the stories tend to interlock and make references to the past . Those who intend to pick up Halo 4 and have not played the first 3 ( not including ODST or Reach ) should consider playing them first or reading the plot.How is Halo 4 overall ? I would say that it is outstanding and does the series justice . The campaign is fun , the story is gripping and is good at making you connect with Chief in this game . The graphics and mechanics are about as good at it gets . The online play is leveled out more from Halo games of the past and include multiple fun game types . The Spartan Ops gives you the opportunity for you and your friends to take the fight to the enemy . To sum it up Halo 4 is an improvement on the other games in most areas . Im not sure why some of the other reviewers are unimpressed with it , but i guess everyone has a right to an opinion.In closing i think Halo 4 is a outstanding thrill ride that earns it 5/5 stars . If i was to use a scale of 1 to 10 i would rate Halo 4 a 9.4 out of 10 . There were minor things that they could 've added to it but they 're nothing significant.Well worth the money .	1
Quite simply the best game released all year . And it 's been a pretty good year . Forza Horizon , Sleeping Dogs , Dragon 's Dogma , Mass Effect 3 . Not a bad year , but Halo 4 is far and away the best . But what 's best of all is that Halo fans can breathe a sigh of relief . Bungie is gone , but the series somehow managed to improve . Graphically and aurally it 's the best its ever been . The story is good , the single player campaign is brilliant , but best of all the multiplayer is stellar .	1
keep away from the caffeine on this one . do n't need any more stimulation than just playing the game . great fun	1
Halo 4 tops all the other halos . The forge mode on this one opens up a new book for creativity . The multiplayer has a broad selection of games to play so getting bored is n't an option . You wo n't regret buying this game if you love all the other halos .	1
Very realistic.Great game play.Only criticism so far is my inability to customize the Xbox control pad for switching the vertical viewing ... ackward .	1
While just having Halo 3 I was n't a major follower of the series story but for the going price and the demo I played I felt like giving this game a shot and was happy to have done so . The graphics and effects throughout the game are astounding and the a.i . is pretty decent though nothing spectacular overall it 's an exciting sci-fi FPS . Still it 's worth adding to the Xbox 360 game library for those who own the console .	1
The Good : Fantastic graphics and sound , tight and balanced gun play , new enemies are fun , lots of fun new weapons , meaty multiplayer suiteThe Bad : Confusing story , campaign is repetitive and unbalanced , feels too similar to other HalosThe Halo series is probably one of the most repetitive and unchanging series I have ever played . The first 3 were pretty good and Reach and ODST made me fall asleep . With Bungie out of the picture and 343 Industries into the captain & # 8217 ; s chair I figured Halo may have some great new changes . I was half right . The single player campaign is pretty fun and is as tough as nails . The new weapons are awesome to shoot and there & # 8217 ; s new enemies for once that are different . The story is convoluted and confusing , but hardcore fans may be able to follow it okay.The mechanics are pretty much the same as previous Halo games . There & # 8217 ; s no iron sights , the game is fast paced with high jumping and fast sprinting . There & # 8217 ; s still no cover system which is a shame and the game is damn hard . I felt the story was a bit random and the environments felt the same way . One minute I & # 8217 ; m shooting the same tired Covenant then these machine type aliens , then mutated Covenant , then regular Covenant . There was some vehicle sections and I was riding a giant vehicle . The game just felt all over the place , but it was fun at least.The story is really confusing and never makes much sense . Something about Cortana being infected and a giant being called the Didact trying to destroy everything . It & # 8217 ; s nothing fancy or sophisticated but you can & # 8217 ; t expect much from an FPS . At least the game just feels tighter and a bit more heavy feeling and less floaty than other Halos . I felt the weapons had weight to them and the sheer variety had me switching them up all the time for different situations . I did find that there were repetitive scenarios through the whole game like jump into stations to hit a button at the top and running back down to get to the next one . This scenario repeated often through the whole game and felt archaic and overly simple.While the structured campaign felt old and tired the multiplayer is still the best part of Halo . The constantly updated match types makes you come back for more all the time . The game feels faster paced and just more fluid and balanced than any previous Halo game . Customization is deep for your avatar , there are many levels to climb , and the unlocks are sweet and rewarding . After you beat the Halo campaign just once I doubt you will ever go back because of how forgettable and repetitive it feels . I honestly think at this point Halo should just continue as a multiplayer only game and maybe jump on board with PC.The few little tweaks here and there help the game just become more balanced overall . The lack of duel wielding makes the game feel more raw and & # 8220 ; hardcore & # 8221 ; , various adjustments in damage from each weapon and the increased damage for melee attacks is nice . I also love how great the game looks . This is the best looking Xbox 360 game out and the voice acting and animations are so life like . However , the Xbox 360 doesn & # 8217 ; t have the processing power as the PS3 so you won & # 8217 ; t see The Last of Us quality textures and lighting effects . There are some ugly textures in Halo 4 and it really showed some times . Surprisingly there wasn & # 8217 ; t any slow down or glitches that plagued other Halo games.Overall , Halo 4 is a great final opus for the 360 but isn & # 8217 ; t the revolutionary new Halo like everyone thought . The campaign is repetitive , extremely difficult , and confusing , the story is so-so , but the multiplayer is where the meat of the game is at .	1
Halo 4 is a great title that is packed with content that will entertain and keep you busy for a long time , the campaign is a great continuation of the halo franchise with 4 player co-op , the multiplayer is addicting and rewarding with new weapons and armor as you level up , the came from a graphical standpoint looks beautiful and runs at a great frame rate , if you have an xbox 360 you should pick it up , and even if you have not played the other titles in the series you can jump in and get up to speed in the game without feeling lost , defiantly check this game out	1
343 Industries had some pretty big shoes to fill , and they stepped up to the plate . The transition from Bungie to 343 is almost seamless . If anything , they have managed to improve upon the foundation that Bungie has established . The iconic Battle Rifle finally feels and sounds just right , the graphics are slightly better . The load times are much improved . There are several complaints about the length of the campaign but in my opinion it 's perfect . I almost gave up on Halo after the 2nd installment , about halfway thru the game I started to wonder if the game would EVER end . Halo 3 and now 4 corrected this , and the campaigns felt perfect in length . The new enemies are really interesting & 343 came up with a great story - I felt more engaged in the story and more invested in the characters than with any of the other Halo games . Really looking forward to # 5 but I suppose I 'll probably have to upgrade to the xbox one to play it which is not a prospect I 'm looking forward to .	1
The Halo franchise returns and delivers a pretty sucessful comeback after Halo 3 , which was a mixed bag for me . This game felt a lot like the first Halo in that I felt like I was the chief and saw/felt what he did . Also the weapons in this game felt like they provided a lot of punch and that I could rely on almost any of them to get through any enemy force . Other improvements were Human vehicles felt more useful again , transitions between vehicles and on foot were better and the storyline was a lot more interesting , and for the first time I felt sorry for characters.One surprising fact was that , while weapons felt like they had improved , enemy resistence appeared to have improved also . Meaning , enemies were felt smarter whilst attacking me but not in the challenging way Halo 3 was , here it was fun to go against them . Another surprise was all the variations of combat we experienced on feet or in the air ( this game had great airel combat situations ) .Now no game is perfect as their are a couple things I did n't like . Melee still did n't feel useful , as weapons appeared to take a long time to butt and then go back to shooting . Also I was bummed that not much explination went into the story between this and 3 , but that 's what the EU is for.Still great game and a worthy comeback for the series .	1
We played the game non-stop on legendary until complete last weekend . Here is my review : Campaign co-op is possible , but if you have more than 2 people , you can not play split-screen , or LAN , you 'll have to play online . What that meant for my 3-person crew , was 3 TVs , 3 XBOXs , and 3 copies of the game , in order for us all to be in the same room , sharing pizza , and having fun in person.Online multiplayer in standard `` forge '' mode is the same as it ever was . Slayer , death-match , oddball , etc.The new Spartan-Ops mode is a PHENOMENAL promise , and if they manage to pull it off , it will set the bar for years to come for online multiplayer . My crew and I have already completed both of the 2 chapters on offer , and they are fun , and fit right into our weekly gaming nights seamlessly.Overall , the game is fun , the campaign picks up right where we left off with the Chief and Cortana , and it is a decent adventure with some heaping amounts of back-story finally filled in . Bonus points if you have been reading the books , because they use that canon in the game . I DID NOT care for the ending , and I am hoping that Halo 5 will change what happened with some sort of comic-book hero resolution to what happened ( I am trying not to spoil it , so I am being vague ) -- but I am also told I am overly sentimental.Final thoughts : the game is still a bit buggy . I personally died about 4 times in the campaign mode due to doors closing on me and just killing me . Additionally , the game is arbitrary about when it will warp you to the rest of the players , depending on the distance you are away from them . Some sort of a gauge on how much distance you have left before you warp ( or warp others ) would be nice . The game also is frustratingly non-obvious in some areas , with no clear objective ( besides survive ) . Finally , we have encountered a glitch in the online Spartan-Ops where our game blacked out like the chapter had completed , but the game did n't actually end -- we had to end the game and re-do it , to get it to complete correctly.Overall , the game is a 5 star effort , with a 4 star result , and that is high praise indeed for a studio picking up the mantle of a legend such as Bungie.4 stars .	1
So glad for another Halo game . Not sure what all the negative reviews are about . I am guessing those are from people who have n't actually played the game.A huge win for 343 and their taking over the franchise . Can not wait to see what they do next !	1
If you played the previous Halos you know what you are in for . This one looks and plays the best so far . The sound is amazing in surround sound and so far the story is quite absorbing . I have n't played the multiplayer yet but if you have an xbox you probably all ready own this .	1
Story mode was great and leaves me wanting more . The second disk has to be installed in order to play multiplayer and is around 4 GB . Spartan ops is welcomed addition but needs more substance . Multiplayer is basically the hybrid of halo 3 's community and cod 's ranking system .	1
I love Halo . I bought the xbox for the first Halo . This is a continuation of what has made this series great from a group of guys ( 343 ) that are truly fans of what they do . The story is great , the multiplayer continues to shine , and the spartan ops are a fantastic continuation of the firefight missions that I loved from the last game . This is my shooter of choice across all platforms . The shooting is spot on , I never feel cheated when I lose the stand offs that make up multiplayer , and the players are a little less obnoxious than the COD dudes . I you have played Halo from the begining why would you stop now ?	1
I love this game I have been playing Halo for atleast 2 years . This is a really fun game really reccomend i love this game in every way . It is a very fun game i reccomend to all player of halo 3 ] 4	1
This game had just a mind blowing campaign that I actually played more than once , and will play AGAIN . This game also has pretty nice new features for multiplayer , one of them being ordnance which is a point streak you earn and it gives you a weapon , or a custom powerup . They did take out some things that i loved in past halo games such as infection , but they brought in flood which is so much B.S it makes it FUN haha .	1
grandson received xbox for xmas and really enjoys this game . will probably want the follow up to this when it is published	1
Halo has been known for it it 's dynamic and entertaining universe . This Halo is defining the future of the halo universe in a beautiful way . Halo 4 is without a doubt the best looking game on xbox 360 & one of the best looking games in the market . The campaign has probably been the most emotional and maybe the best in the halo series . With new enemies and weapons the Halo series is n't showing any signs of aging rather a fresh new start . The multiplayer is solid with a few bugs but still great . New game mode every week makes it fun and competitive . Spartan ops forge and custom games are still fun as always . Campaign 10/10 multiplayer 9/10 Spartan ops 8.5/10 forge 9/10 custom games 9/10 graphics 9.5/10 music 9/10 overall 9.5/10	1
I 've played all the Halo games ( except the RTS ) , and can honestly say that this is one of the best our of the 6 . Nothing compares to first experiencing the Halo universe but in terms of overall quality , this ranks at the top.If you love Cortana , you will especially like this sequel because the focus is on her . Someone spoiled the ending for me and I still enjoyed the story.The new bad guys in the game keep the combat and game play in general interesting and enjoyable . The graphics are amazing and the level design is superb . Every aspect of the game is outstanding . I do n't have much of anything to complain about so I 'll need to cut this short.If you love Halo , your probably already finished this game . If you never liked Halo , this game wo n't change your mind .	1
My favorite halo game in the series ... multiplayer is well balanced and has a quick and fun pace . campaign is fresh with the new enemies .	1
i got this for my boyfriend for christmas he loves halo and all that jazz , is this enough words yet ?	1
My oldest son ( 10 ) loves the Halo games . He and my other four children play frequently together . At 10 years old he beat the game not too long after receiving it as a gift !	1
I was n't sure what to expect from 343 Industries and was n't enamored with the most recent offers of Halo ODST or Halo Reach . Halo 4 bring the franchise back to its roots , and raises the bar with new enemies , weapons , shield abilities , and rides ( jet packs , air ships , etc. ) . Lots of replayability with new Sartan Ops game mode , and good multiplayer . Must buy for any Halo or sci-fi shooter fan .	1
I am a HUGE fan of the Halo universe having read all the books , played all the games , and watch the recent prequel movie : Forward unto Dawn . Halo 4 really delivers on an excellent story and good gameplay .	1
**** BACKGROUND ****For those that do not know , Halo 4 is the fourth entry into the Halo series . Halo is a first person shooter that has become a staple of the Microsoft world with its main character , Master Chief , being a mascot for the Xbox gaming system as Mario is to Nintendo or Sonic is to Sega.The original three titles in the series were designed by Bungie Studios . The latest addition was designed by 343 studios and is considered the start of a new trilogy to the Halo series . Prior to start on Halo 4 , 343 studios gained experience with the Halo series by re-visiting and re-doing Halo : Combat evolved , the first game in the series released on the original Xbox console , as Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary for the current Xbox 360 console.With the switch in developers , many have wondered if this title would live up to the reputation established in previous games.To put it mildly , yes , Halo 4 is a worthy entry into the beautiful world that is Halo 4.++Halo : Combat Evolved ( Original ) ++Halo 2++Halo 3++Halo 3 : ODST++Halo : Combat Evolved Anniversary**** STORY ****The Halo gaming series is known for deep involving story lines through each entry . Halo 4 is no exception . The Halo story lines are one of the many key aspects that make these games as great as they are.The story picks up five years after the end of Halo 3 with Master Chief , the protagonist of the game , adrift aboard the wreckage of the UNSC frigate with the AI Cortana who is operating past her natural life span.I do not want to give away key plot points but the game is not a straight forward shooter as previous entries could tend to be . The story of Halo 4 attempts to be more exploratory and mysterious in the events as they unfold . The game does set it up to be the first in a three game story arch as it does not quite answer some of the questions are you left with after Halo 3 leaving you hoping that those questions are addressed in future titles.One thing to note is that the story line is not slow paced . You will be up and shooting at the Covenant , the antagonists of the game , in no time . **** GAMEPLAY & COMBAT ****The game has some of the most polished controls I have played on the game never encountering frustrating moments like I have experienced on games part of other series . Your character has the usual assortment of `` right gun for the right situation '' and ability to carry two at a time , a long established rule of thumb in First Person Shooters for some time now as well as selection of vehicles to of try out.The levels do not feel as constrained or paint by the numbers but feel a little more open ended . They also flow naturally from running on foot to the inclusion of vehicles to operate.The enemies , as I wrote under CHALLENGE , have some of the best AI programming I have seen in a game series . As you set the difficulty on different higher levels you can see how the addition of IQ points to the enemy**** GRAPHICS & PRESENTATION ****The cutscene CG graphics are breathtaking showing that , even though the game system is six years old , there is still limits in which the console can yet still be pushed.This continues onto the actual gameplay itself . This is a must as the Halo series are considered the staple of the Xbox and is what other games should measure up to and strive to be . The game series is a representation of the Xbox and its potential.I have the game hooked up to a 5.1 Home Theater and the sound is incredible . The composed score really creates an atmosphere that draws you into the game . The sound of weapons being fired , explosions , and the chants of the Covenant had my two labradors on the edge of the couch wondering what was going on the entire game time . **** CHALLENGE ****Truthfully , I am not the greatest gamer in the world . I love games , I never claim to be good at them . I played Halo on the Normal difficulty and it gave me a run for my money while still leaving me with the Heroic and Legendary levels to tackle.The enemies still display some of the best AI I have seen . Sometimes fighting the enemy I feel as if I am connected to Xbox Live and am playing against a human opponent who truly is thinking on the fly and not some preprogrammed act/react code . The enemies are that challenging on single player campaign.I never did encounter those moments where you feel like tossing the remote at against the wall . **** MULTIPLAYER ****Online multiplayer was not utilized at this time as I am having issues with my Xbox Live account . My nephew , who is sixteen , picked up the controller prior to taking off for school.For cooperative play , you can have two players sharing a split screen . If we were able to connect to Xbox Live , we could have up to four players playing at one time . **** CONCLUSION ****This game is a worthy addition to the Halo series . This title is a definite `` MUST HAVE '' for the holiday season and any Xbox 360 console owner who enjoys First Person Shooters or needs a game to show off the potential of what their game machine is capable of . I would even go as far as saying this is in the running for my `` Game of the Year . ''	1
Great buy ! I got it what I thought was used : NEW ! Or it is in such good condition can be considered new ! Great buy !	1
Please feel free to verify that I have completed enough of the game to responsibly write a review . Xbox Live Gamer Tag `` Apollonius of P '' , I have completed the campaign and all of the spartan ops on Legendary , and played PvP enough to speak to its value.Forward : I am mainly an RPG gamer , and I rarely enjoy FPS , map based valued games like Halo , Battlefield and CoD for more than the campaign . BUT this is a huge exception , contrary to other FPS games , starting with Halo ODST and culminating in Halo 4 , the Halo universe has become very rich and allows for you to delve in wholeheartedly ! Campaign : I am completely in love with the new story , 343 Industries really put in the time on the story and after some earlier 2012 games that showed just how little a Developer can care about their loyal fans concerns ( Mass Effect 3 ) this was a very nice effort . On Legendary I have spent twenty or so hours just getting all of the campaign completed , all of the terminals found and all of the campaign based goodness that is buried in the new story.I want a first time ever in the halo universe . Campaign related DLC ! Not just map packs , more story related content ... Spartan Ops : This is the best new feature in my opinion , 10 episodes with 5 chapters each , one new episode releasing every week . If you are not a PvP gamer these are all maps that are just what you are looking for . Plus there is a whole separate story occurring that is larger than some other games . I would label this Campaign 2 , with your own spartan instead of Master Chief.This is another place I would like to see more DLC . After the first ten episodes , make ten more please ! War Games : Not really my thing , but I find it playable and keep going back for more punishment nightly ! I am very pleased with the matchmaking and the new armor mods make the maps way more fun . Its a little weird when half of the opposing team has active camouflage equipped , better look closely at every distortion , or DEATH comes often.I feel as though 343 truly cares what the fans want , and that they delivered on the fans desires , with no greed on release day . I would say that they clearly delivered more than they had to for the $ 60 price tag , that is fan appreciation 101.Thank you 343 Industries , I appreciate your hard work and continued effort in making the Halo Universe better with every release !	1
What I can say about this game.. ? is just perfect , the chief master come back and a old enemy returns too , excellent history	1
This game was a pleasant surprise . I had initial doubts about the game : How could it possibly be amazing after Bungie decided to end it ? I was n't awed by Reach 's new gameplay , and so I was very happy when 343 delivered improvements to Reach 's foundation . The grenades , while powerful , are n't mini nukes anymore , the Armor abilities are smoother , the addition of the sprint function make getting around a lot easier.I really enjoyed the campaign . I liked the introduction of Promethean as new enemies ... It 's great to learn how to fight a new enemy . Covenant are old news so it 's nice to see that 343 brought innovation as well as new life into the Halo series . Multiplayer is fun , I like how people can join in mid match ... which is super helpful because quitting midgame was a problem in all the previous halo games , ( from halo 2-Reach ) Bottom line : I 'm happy to have Halo back in my life , and I 'm going to play a little multiplayer while I wait for a continuation of Cortana and Master Chief 's story . Halo , has been , and should always be a great balance of innovative multiplayer and great story telling .	1
A lot of people didnt like this game but I thought it was interesting . A friend of mine has & # 34 ; insider & # 34 ; info on the next 2 coming out ( last 2 ) and it seems really cool the way they are going to go . ( If its true ) .	1
I love this game the greatness of HALO 4 cant be measured i love the multiplayer and all of the story and aspartan oppsthis game takes me back to the amazing days of halos 1 2 and 3	1
... .and may I say , Halo 4 is the best Halo yet.From the opening moments to the ending of the game to the multiplayer , this game just reeks of quality and polish finish.The chief 's story is more cortana 's this time around as the ai is experiencing the death phases in her life as she gets pretty unstable . I have n't seen anything quite like it in a video-game and sets up for a really great story.That 's another thing , the story in Halo 4 easily outpaces any other story in the franchise and that 's saying something . The writers did a fantastic job with it.Neil Davidge put up a widely compelling piece of music and is easily on-par with Marty's.In all , this is the best Halo game yet and 343 Industries makes the transition a huge success . Oh yeah , and the graphics are to die for .	1
I love this game , I 'm just not thrilled that it requires 8gb to play online multi-player . Very fun campaign , though !	1
Really a great addition to the halo series . I own all of the halo games , and love this one . Must get for any halo fan.Only things i hate : - Kill cam ( REALLY DUMB ) - No custom mapping for controller buttons ( Ca n't set buttons to what you want , you have to choose from presets ) - There is n't a Team Snipers playlist ... yet ... ( I KNOW , I KNOW ! It will probably be added , JUST SAYING ... ) That 's about it ... Do n't be cheap , treat yourself to it now !	1
343 did a great job in carrying on the Halo franchise . Thankfully they did n't change or remove anything that was true to Halo . They only improved on what Bungie had successfully created . I look forward to many more chapters in the Halo franchise from 343 .	1
Awesome shooter game for halo fans , and fps fans alike . Story is compelling and interesting while the shooting is fun and exciting . Did n't really play multiplayer though	1
I have so many things I could say but am just going to say its the best dam halo series ever made !	1
I would admit that I was very skeptical about the another software developement company taking over such a great legacy as this . I would almost have to say that for the best they should let the series die out instead of making a really dissapointed effort . But 343 did an excellant job . They did not change any of the controls , the story line was surprising good even though it was a short campaign and it dove a little more into the world of Halo 's back story . I will be waiting for a follow to this game just hope they do not get too cheesy with it and let it run until it stops and not drag it out .	1
This game is incredible and light years ahead of Reach . The game play and variety of games on the disk is terrific . Graphics are wonderful and game play simply GREAT .	1
I 'd never played much multiplayer Halo before , except for a few rounds of Halo Reach . It was n't that I had anything against Halo ; it was just something I had n't gotten around to . That all changed the day I played Halo 4 on my brother 's console . I suddenly understood what all the hype was about . 343 hit a grand-slam with this title . The gameplay is smooth , exciting , tense and absolutely beautiful to behold . Tons of weapons and upgrades . Gameplay types are varied , and maps are good but they could 've added a couple more ( like a volcanic planet map or a jungle map ) . The voice-over narration during multiplayer is excellent too . Make Halo 4 the next addition to your library .	1
The only problem I found with the game is that the game seems to be kind of short . But the main problem is the fact that Microsoft gives you very limited maps for the multiplayer part of the game unless you want to spend more money .	1
This game is truly amazing . If you have not played it you are missing out on a great story and just simply an amazing engaging experience . I remember when the original Xbox came out and I got Halo CE for Christmas and I did not do anything else with my life for months to come , it was come home do my homework and play halo over and over again , not to mention those awesome old school LAN parties when people brought TVs over and everyone put in for pizza and spent the night at their buddies house . Then Halo 2 introduced us to the craziness of addictive online multiplayer then a campaign experience that totally rocked and took us for a spin.We forward to Halo 4 which to me brings back the kid feeling of the Original Halo CE and the fun Halo 2 multiplayer experience . This game from beginning to end grips you , there is no wanting to put the control down , it feels and looks amazing . Usually after I beat a game I am done with it and walkaway for weeks to months at a time , as soon as I beat this game I put it right back in and played it all the way through again and continue to do so . Have n't done that since Arkham Asylum , and before that Halo 1 and 2 , and even back to Zelda Ocarina of time days . This game simply is a masterpiece so stop thinking about buying it , and just get it you will not be disappointed .	1
I enjoyed Halo 4 , and it was a great effort for 343 Industries , given the tremendous pressure they must have felt to live up to the Bungie games . The gameplay has been modernized with equipment and always-available sprinting , but it still plays like classic Halo , which is good . The enemies are well balanced and a challenge to take down , though the little & # 34 ; dog & # 34 ; things are pretty feeble : ) . The Prometheans approximate the Covenant in strength , number and tactics , so the player will feel right at home . Two differences worth noting - the AI is not as aggressive as in Bungie Halos , and the Promethean Knights ' shields are not nearly as obvious when they are dissipated , so these two differences will require a minor adjustment in game-play style . Overall , I liked Halo 4 a little less than Halo 3 , but substantially more than Halo 2 . I would rank all 5 games this way : Halo 1 : 100 % ; Halo : Reach : 97 % ; Halo ODST : 93 % ; Halo 3 : 90 % ; Halo 4 : 86 % ; Halo 2 : 70 % .	1
This game is a major improvement over Halo 3 in many ways.First the visuals are amazing I never believed consoles could deliver such stunning graphics . Even the audio is just outstanding , I bought this along with the Ear Force X12 Gaming Headset and Amplified Stereo Sound because I was annoyed with my TV 's sub par audio performance anyways here are the pros and cons.Pros : GraphicsAudioGameplayMultiplayer ( surprisingly ) Campaign ( It was good but a sad ending : / ) Difficulty ( I played Reach and my god it was impossible ) Cons : Short Story ( Took me around 6-7 hours to finish ) Maybe the Frequent updates because I do n't have the fastest broadband connection ) NO FIREFIGHT This for me was n't the best idea because even though it was impossible I definitely loved the Reach campaign.You can only hold 2 grenades at E3 2012 the gameplay trailer showed us the ability to hold up to 4 , sadly this is not the case.Well that 's it for my review . If you are debating this or Black Ops II well I 'm not sure about you but I would buy this ! Take care all : )	1
The strongest part of this game are the graphics . They truly are some of the best I have seen on consoles . The gameplay is standard Halo , nothing new . As the story goes I enjoyed the original Halo and Halo : Reach better , but this was still very compelling . It was a bit disappointing that they did n't include an online co-op for the campaign . The spartan ops campaign is solid , but why is there not an option to play any of the levels online instead of the 5 per week that they choose . They made some strange design decisions with this game but overall I still had a good time with it . 4.5/5 . Highly recommended .	1
My husband has played all of the Halo games and was pleased to get this game for Christmas . He started playing in between our company for the day .	1
The campaign and multi-player are both top notch ! Graphics are the best seen on a console . I want to give the game 5 stars but the removal of firefight is disappointing . Spartan Ops does n't replace it .	1
my son plays the heck out of these games . , he beats them over and over but still very much enjoys playing them great buy	1
For all the trolls knocking this game , go back to licking windows and eating paste . This has to be one of the greatest games to date and in the top 10 of ALL TIME . I 've been a gamer since PONG and had 90 % of the systems ever made . This truly is EXCELLENT , I 'd give it 11 stars because everone knows 11 is better than 10..I have n't played multi yet but the story/campaign is immersive.Graphics are outstanding.New guns , new enemiesCut screnes are 100 % stellar ! Story line is epic ! Lets you feel like Master Chief.BOTTOM LINE ... ... If you liked the first HALO ... You get that same feeling with Halo 4 ... .fresh new & exciting ! ! !	1
Installing the game was a struggle ( because of games for windows live bugs ) .Some championship races and cars can only be `` unlocked '' by buying them as an addon to the game . I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new . I do n't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game . I 'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.I 'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally , and you should to . : ) http : //www.amazon.com/Richard-Burns-Rally-PC/dp/B000C97156/ref=sr_1_1 ? ie=UTF8 & qid ; =1341886844 & sr ; =8-1 & keywords ; =richard+burns+rallyThank you for reading my review ! If you enjoyed it , be sure to rate it as helpful .	-1
1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a FAKE one . Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box . I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content . They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.Returned it good bye . !	-1
I ca n't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is . Like everything else Microsoft makes- it does n't work . When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time . To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min . to accomplish . If you want another disappointment from Microsoft , buy some `` Games for Windows Live '' games . I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting . If that 's what you want , do n't buy this . If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game , then buy it . oh , one more thing , every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working ( there 's Windows 7 for you )	-1
I still have n't figured this one out . Did everything as instructed but the game never installed . Strange . Since I do n't like to rate on something I could n't get to work , I 'll just say that I did n't like it because I could n't get it to work : P For those that did manage to get it installed , I 'm sure it 's a great game . I had the first Dirt and it was a scream ! Too bad this one bombed . Maybe a bad disc ...	-1
I bought this and the key did n't work . It was a gift , and the recipient was n't able to solve the problem . It might have been a good game , but I never found out because the key failed .	-1
Crashed in Vista . Codemasters told me they do n't support it in Windows 8 . Could n't get it to work even after looking on the Internet .	-1
This game was a rip-off . It has less terrain , less tracks , and less features than DiRT 2 . The graphics are about the same . Not worth the money , at all .	-1
This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software . Then it did not have any voice sounds . Then it was running on windowed mode only . Now , everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer ( BSoD ) .I give up . Codemasters , next time , dont rush a game out just because you have to . Test the game ! If not for yourself for Colin himself . If he was alive he would be embarrassed.And do n't buy the game using Steam because if it does not work , Steam will show you the finger : )	-1
DiRT 2 was like this . I 'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play . It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for . Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason ? I do n't care what they say publicly . Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight , and nobody 's looking . It 's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you 're being tracked , but this type of continuous spying is something more . That aside , this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet ( Windows Live ) to play . Annoying interface . Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do . Most settings do n't keep between sessions . Setting up a race takes way too long . Irritating `` music '' you ca n't turn off ( it keeps coming back ) . Takes too long to unlock things . Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out . Video stuttering ( possibly my equipment ) .PROS - Eye candy . Plenty of game modes . Enough tracks to get going . Fairly good variety of cars . Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced.I think this franchise , like many others , continues soley for the purpose of farming user information ; where it seems the real money is . If I ca n't turn it off , and some else controls the on-off switch , that 's a problem . Sometimes it might be worth it , but not here . I found some entertainment value , but very briefly . Anyway , just my opinion ...	-1
I would like give this game 4 or 5 stars , if I could get it to run . Like others the game crashes on start-up or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it . Why they ca n't get their asses in gear ( pun intended ) and fix it I do n't know , but with so many folks reporting the problem it is n't just occasional . I assume they either ca n't replicate the problem or just do n't care . Lacking any help from Codemasters , I 've tried the various fan fixes , including uninstalling Rapture 3D . Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that did n't help either , which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing sim .	-1
The game itself is great , but Games for Windows Live is such a frustrating piece of garbage . I wish it would just die and stop bringing down my PC gaming experience .	-1
I can not get this thing to work with my Wii Rockband 3.It might be related to the USB hub that I 'm using , but it simply refuses to be detected by the game.Cosmetically , it 's a microphone . Bit on the ugly side.I would be wary of compatibility issues with this one .	-1
The greatest bait and switch betrayal of a fanbase in videogaming history and most hated game of all time.To begin I will provide Amazon 's customer base the & # 34 ; tale of the turd & # 34 ; as I call it in relation to this abomination 's & # 34 ; quality & # 34 ; or rather lackthereof : Gameplay : Utterly challengeless . A lobotomy patient , a two year old drooling baby in a feces filled diaper or even an individual with a severe case of down syndrome could easily complete this game in a single sitting with minimal effort . Just mash buttons or & # 34 ; spam & # 34 ; the controls as PC gamers would say and you 'll eventually complete this atrocious slap in the face Disney level Aonuma dreck.Graphics : Hideous , vomit inducing , ridiculous , teletubbies-esque , bait and switch from what we were originally promised at Spaceworld 2000 ( realistic style epic , cool and beautiful graphics with a decidedly Lord Of The Rings style flare ) Also there are ugly and gaudy white lines that appear all throughout Wand Wacker indicating Nintendo was not able to polish this turd before release . Oh what a shame.Sound : The only redeemable inspiring thing about this Aonuma dud is the ocean music likely composed by Koji Kondo . The rest is detestable Saturday morning cartoon level kiddy drivel . Soccer moms and grandparents should approve . Real Zelda fans can only vomit at this level of disrespect Nintendo has stooped to in order to insult us.Theme : Near total rip off of Kevin Costner 's Water World to such a great extent I fully believe Costner could probably win a lawsuit against Nintendo for royalties if he so desired . Needless to say this watery environment is not what true Zelda fans look forward to when we go to pick up a new Zelda game . No , what we 're looking for is the green forests and fields of Hyrule proper , not some watery grave that sits atop it for reasons likely relating to Aonuma 's child learning how to bathe for the first time and Aonuma getting inspired to make Zelda into a giant bathing simulator via Wand Wacker . I 've said it before and I 'll say it again Nintendo needs to fire Eiji Aonuma and his entire Zelda team and get normal people developing the Zelda series again for it to return to health.Commentary : The online game journalists also known as professional liars can attempt to re-write history all they like but The Legend Of Celda : Wand Wacker will go down as the most hated videogame of all time and the greatest betrayal of a fanbase in gaming history.This was Nintendo , Miyamoto and Eiji Aonuma 's Vince Mcmahon esque & # 34 ; Screw you ! & # 34 ; to the true Zelda fanbase and by true Zelda fanbase I 'm not referring to the scumbag sycophants that populate online gaming message forums but the market in general who determines whether videogames become massive successes or massive failures and the true Zelda fans spoke loud and clear not once but twice.Two whole times on that Wand Wacker piece of dog excrement first with its original Gamecube release and second with its Wii U HD re-release that this is not the way that they envisioned the Legend Of Zelda series , this is not the way they wanted it to go and as a result Wand Wacker flopped mightily BOTH times as such a Benedict Arnold or Rosenbergs esque betrayal is destined to do.To rephrase a quote from Ridley Scott 's Gladiator : & # 34 ; Marcus Aurelius had a dream that was Zelda and this is not it , THIS IS NOT IT ! & # 34 ; We were lied to and led to believe that the epic , cool , badass , Spaceworld 2000 realistically presented Zelda would be what we would soon be getting on the Gamecube but then much later the bait and switch hideously deformed Celda Wand Wacker made its debut to boos and hisses worldwide and massive hate on the internet was poured it and Nintendo 's way ( before the damage control brainwashing took effect which has left a dishonest internet forum gaming community in its wake who pretends to love Wand Wacker in order to shill and run damage control for Nintendo while real Zelda fans have abandoned Nintendo due to its betrayal of them for the other consoles or PC gaming if they have n't simply upped and left gaming in disgusting over this nasty unnecessary debacle and betrayal of Zelda 's true fans.Eiji Aonuma the hack no talent Jimmy Fallon Of Japan enabled by the out of touch Shigeru Miyamoto has been ruining the Zelda series since he took up its reigns to create the embarrassment known as Majora 's Mask.Aonuma 's first game & # 34 ; Marvelous & # 34 ; failed ( MARVELOUSLY ! ) and he had no credentials at all to be given the Zelda series but insanely Nintendo gave it to him and ever since he 's been driving Zelda along with it 's sales figures into the ground making one boring puzzle filled bad NPC filled faux Zelda game after another.When the truth of the matter is Zelda is supposed to be an arcade action adventure sword and sorcery game with light RPG elements thrown in for good measure.Aonuma completely butchers this formula in favor of the boring garbage gameplay elements he prefers and the market lets him know what it thinks of his efforts by making sure his version of Zelda ends up in the bomba discount gaming bins where such low quality trash belongs.In anycase to re-iterate so as to set this very important point in stone once more : Wand Wacker offers up literally no gameplay challenge whatsoever and can be completed by a lobotomy patient ( as is typical of Aonuma offerings ) .Conclusion : My rating of this turd is 1 star since I ca n't give it lower due to how Amazon 's system is set up .	-1
Are 9 out of 10 GAMECUBE games like this little kid 's game terrible ? Answer : YesI bought the game , and I regret it so much !	-1
I was very disappointed in this item . We thought we would get a better picture than the standard WII video cables , but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction . I would not recommend .	-1
I enjoyed the first Hawx game . However they left out some key things in Hawx 21 ) No coop mode - I really enjoyed that2 ) Ca n't choose your own plane right off the bat . You have to use whatever they tell you.Those two things will make me not play this game anymore !	-1
I loved the first Hawx PC game when it came out . Playing Hawx 2 got boring after several missions , is just a shame .	-1
There are at least 5 missions that can not be completed without joining the forum , then the Creator 's Forum , and a lot of research , downloading , etc . 4 of these defective missions were built by `` Bottman '' ... someone that should definitely find another occupation.BUT ... do not waste your time because the missions are incredibly boring and far from challenging . The ones they label as `` Hard '' are as easy as those labeled `` Easy '' . My 6-year granddaughter could do most of them after 15 minutes of instruction.Do not buy this product . The GFX are circa 2003 , the user interface far from intuitive , and the support abysmal . It 's a waste of money & time.Too bad . Ship.sim 2006 was actually better ... .AND all the missions worked . Vstep took one giant step backward .	-1
My father is a seaman . I have seen many ships , sailed with him around the world numerous times . So ships are in my blood . When i saw this game I bought it without batting an eyelid . Well I wish I did n't because I now regret my decision.The game is unique in its concept . We never really had a maritime ship simulation that was n't centrally focused on war and sinking other ships : ) . This one happens to be just peace-time shipping simulation with different kinds of detailed ships ranging from cargo , to passenger , to rescues , to towing , to even trying to alter history by succesfully sailing Titanic to New york on its first maiden voyage etc . The game creator has gone to great details to simulate as much as possible the Intricacies of piloting as well as managing huge ships operations . Any aspiring sea captian or sea salt will identify with some if not most aspects of piloting a ship as simulated in this game . But to me thats where all the goodies end.The cons associated with game are just too game-breaking to me and i have essentially stopped playing the game . Until these issues gets addressed i am not spending anymore money on this games series.First and foremost this game badly needs a voluntary `` Time Compression '' feature . Not all of us have 2-3 hours to devote each time we decide to play this game to have some fun . Sometimes it take an hour or so just to get out of harbour and tag some hours more on this to complete the mission . With a game in which you are looking at ocean waves for hours this gets boring really fast . This is just plain very annoying and game destroying factor to me . I know some people have all the time in the world to savour and enjoy games but a lot dont too . Since its not a action oriented game the passage of time is felt even more . If they can incorporate a Time Compression feature it will make the game lot more open to different segments of gamers.Second is the still dated graphics engine . I see lots of people commenting on how good the graphics look . I have a pretty good rig and i can play games like Mass Effect and Silent Hunter 4 in almost thearatical quality but even with everything maxed out this game just looks medicore graphics wise . The ships and ocean etc . looks very simplistically rendered from today 's standard . The graphical quality of this game released in 2008 is kind of dissappointing though.Last some of the missions in the game are just plain novice or fillers in my opinion . This game is geared towards people who like to pilot huge ships yet we have a lot of missions devoted to speed boats for stunts , hover boats etc . I bought the game to simulate a ship expirience not go around flipping in speed boats.Anyways..i would n't really recommend anyone spend $ 40 bucks on this game . Wait until it gets to $ 19 or so bargain bin . And i hope the developers put some real effort into make a more viable ship simluator for its next incarnation or you are not getting any more money from me .	-1
This thing was DOA . It was n't even worth returning for the money I spent on it . Do n't waste your money on this card .	-1
I bought 4 of these , 1 of which was shipped to me with defects , and 2 more became defective within about 2 weeks of normal use . I would not recommend these to any one , but could n't give a 1 star as1 of 4 cords still works fine	-1
I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.Well , my problem ( s ) ? Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me ) It 's cheap now so , I guess it would n't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..so do what you want with it .	-1
Breath of Fire Three is the third part to what was a very good series of RPGs . Breath of Fire One seems to be what most people I talk to about games consider the best . Even though I loved Breath of Fire 2 the most . I expected a lot from breath of fire 3 . Perhaps this helped lower my opinion of Breath of fire 3 , but I did not like this game.As far as game play goes like all BoF games in BoF 3 you have the ability to turn into a dragon . Like BoF 1 and unlike BoF2 when you turn into a dragon you stay one for a while . While you 're a dragon you loose MP every turn to keep you from staying one forever in that combat unlike BoF 1 . All the character seem to get their own special power . The character list is short and one of the characters on the list of the book never fights with you as a character . The training system you can find people to help you with is actually kind of pointless weird and honestly I did n't like it . The town to town walking is slow and you never get fast transportation.As far as plot goes the plot is the plot starts off okay . Then about two hours in goes in a different direction . It is fine for a while then but around the end is a large dungeon that is boring to go threw and leaves the any not very much of a climax . They lost any suspense you could have built up similar to the Tales Of Destiny ending . Also the characters do n't have very strong and noticeable personalities . Also if you keep up with it you wo n't like the direction the plot takes thirds of the way threw.As far as control goes it 's basically standard of with noting exceptionally notable about it.The graphics to this game are not very good . It is done in sprites . Sometimes I myself prefer sprits but I do not like the character drawings of this game . On the walking town to town map character looks chubby and short . The drawings are basic and too simple . There was only one of the dragons I liked the look of . However there is a little onion that can follow around with your party who beat all other RPGs in cuteness of a single character . The cute hopping onion is defiantly the main reason to buy this game if you do.And finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting the game is longer them many RPGs wo n't be beaten on a short rental . If you get this game buy it.Overall this game is the worst of the BoF series . I do n't recommend buying it unless its finishes some collection you are working on , or if you have to see a hopping onion follow people around .	-1
this is an excellent game that really has some substance ! the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII . if FF7 was too long for you , get breath of fire 3. the story is good and the battle system is great !	-1
yeah the cpu is like completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu doesnt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but some of the characters can be pretty hard like T. Hawk but i just dont get the street fighter arcade - like feeling	-1
I actually played the Saturn version with the 4MB RAM cart , and I have to say that the PS1 version SUCKS ! Why ? Because tag-team was taken out because the PS1 could not handle it . It did not have enough RAM ( Random Access Memory ) to switch fighters since it takes about at least 40 MB of RAM , and the PS1 only has 32 MB . If Capcom did put in tag-team , then it would take forever to load up a character once you tag-team with it , you can tag-team with the same character , but it does not feel the same.I suggest get a Saturn , ( it is only $ 10 bucks or less ) get a 4MB RAM cart which you can find at EB.com , or any Video game store , and get the Import version of X-men vs. Street Fighter , trust me you wont be disappointed .	-1
To say that the PS1 version of Capcom 's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly . What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight . This feature made for great fighting fun , but because of the PS1 's RAM inabilities , that feature had to be omitted . It 's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses , and while on it 's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature , the graphics are painfully watered down , the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates , and there is loads of slowdown . If you can get past all that , this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan , but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time .	-1
When a system is incapable of doing justice to a game , one would think a company would be smart enough to not release the game on that system . But for reasons that are probably based entirely around making money , Capcom has released a completely butchered version of its arcade fighter , X-Men vs. Street Fighter , on the PlayStation . The only thing added to the game is super cancels , which allow you to string multiple super combos together . Super cancels were lifted out of Street Fighter EX without much forethought , so some characters ' cancels work better than others . In fact , the entire game seems to have been designed without much forethought . Even if this were a perfect translation of the arcade game , the simple fact remains that X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a terrible , unbalanced , pound-on-buttons-at-random-and-win-anyway fighting game.One of the few things the arcade version ( and the Saturn version , which was an arcade-perfect translation ) had going for it was the graphics . They were n't spectacular , but the characters were large , colorful , and used a lot of frames of animation . The PlayStation , a fairly weak machine when it comes to 2D , simply ca n't handle that much data . So Capcom chopped out tons of frames ( Juggernaut does a whole lot of standing still , and his attacks are about two frames ) . The graphics look very washed out , and there is a completely unacceptable amount of slowdown . Ken 's Shinryuken super combo had most of the frames chopped out , and it still slows the game down to a crawl . The slowdown and missing frames are so bad and so noticeable that they have a detrimental effect on the already bad gameplay.The arcade version 's big selling point was that you picked two characters and could tag-team between the two at any time during the fight . Your teammate would also come out and help in a two-level team attack , as well as in Alpha counter-style attacks . Since duplicating this on the PlayStation would require keeping four entire sets of animations in memory , the tag feature has been completely removed . You still pick a second character ( cruelly taunting players expecting the full functionality of the arcade version ) , but he only makes his presence felt during the team attacks and counters . To make up for the shortened play time , the one-round battles of the arcade have been extended to the standard two-out-of-three format . Characters also slowly regain life , much like your backup character would in the arcade.This game just should n't exist . At some point in the development cycle , someone should have stepped in , seen that the PlayStation simply could n't do justice to the original game , and pulled the plug . It took an additional 4MB of RAM to get the Saturn , which already has more RAM than the PlayStation , to run a perfect version of the game . I like the Street Fighter series as much as the next guy , but this is taking it way too far .	-1
I spent a week trying to get a grasp of the controls for this game . I 'm a true Batman fan and even I had to put this game down after several attempts . It was either too dark so you did n't know where the character was going or you could n't establish enough control of the game to fight the bad guys . Not real crazy about the commute to the crime location as well , it was hard to locate where you were going , unless you are the true dark knight who knows every inch of Gothem City . Unfortunately , the writers expected us to know as well .	-1
Yes I 'll review Batman & Robin to the Playstation and why could n't have been like Batman Forever arcade . It 's wrose than Batman Forever on SNES and Genesis . I do n't know which is wrose this game or the Joel Schumacer film . Becuse I do n't know what to do after I get the diamond . I know what I 'm getting with the film a very bad one . Just leave them both alone .	-1
This game is complete crap.The graphics look decent , but the gameplay is for sh**.I ca n't even begin to tell you how bad `` Batman & Robin '' is.First off , the controls are terrible.You have a hell of a time trying to figure out how to fight , drive the batmobile , swim , use the gadgets ... it 's even a pain to try and walk.The map of Gotham is very small and all of the buildings of the area look the same.The game is also almost impossible.You get one life.After you die , it 's game over , and right back to the beginning.You can also die quickly as well.You can play as either Batman , Robin or Batgirl , but their combat moves look absolutley retarded.Overall , this is THE WORST Batman game I have EVER PLAYED ! `` Batman Forever '' on Genesis was better then this dud , and we all know how bad that game was.I HIGHLY recommend that you DO NOT buy this.The ONLY reason why you MIGHT wan na purchase this , is because it 's a pretty rare game , and it could be a part of your game collection , but as far as the game itself goes ... .IT SUCKS !	-1
The graphics and gameplay are very out dated . The movies at the end are stupid and only the first eight players have them . The only reason I even got this game is because I loved Tekken 2,3 , Tag , and 4 . The only reason I do n't sell this is I want to have all the tekkens , but if you want to buy it , do n't pay more than $ 2 for it .	-1
You know you 're in trouble when other terrible video games are compared to you . Though only a little worse than Charlie 's Angels ( GameCube ) and not as bad as Hidden Invasion ( PlayStation2 ) , Fighting Force is the difinitive bad adventure-fighting game that fits on the same crap list as Burning Fight . Even Brawl Bros and Peace Keepers are better than this , and that 's saying a lot.You get your pick from four forgettable crime fighters : pixie-pig-tailed Alana , gruff Hawk , leather-pants-wearing `` Look at me , I 'm Nabiki Tendo '' Mace , and prison inmate Smasher . They 're out to get a psychopath who believes the world should have ended at the beginning of 2000 A.D. and is now determined to make that happen . Maybe he should have waited through the other 23 times it turned New Years day across the world.Many Sega Saturn owners did n't realize then how lucky they were that this game was cancelled on their system . Nintendo 64 owners were not so lucky , and I was n't so lucky after getting the PlayStation version.The controls are sloppy , the hit detection is horrible , especially the dash attacks , and the character animation is almost jerky enough to look like an old claymation cartoon.If there is one redeeming factor , it is the music . Though not great , the musical scores in this game are a nice touch . The only reason you should buy this disc is to pop it into a CD-playing radio or computer and skip track one since that 's just a data track ... meaning all you will hear , if anything , is an annoying buzz . Start on Track 2 , sit back , and enjoy the only good thing about this game .	-1
I was only 5 years old my first time playing this game back in Christmas of 1997 . I was never able to get past the first couple levels then . But I always loved this game . It was magic back then . The graphics were also great THEN . Second time around , I was 12 and it was 2004 . I was able to finally finish the entire game and find all the secrets to . Now in 2012 , I had the urge to replay this game again . To get those feeling of being so young . I 'm 19 , and the magic is completely gone , and for ONE REASON.BE WARNED ... ... if you have a full HD TV and have a PS3 , and bought a physical copy of this game ... ... the playback visuals of this game will be absolutely HORRIBLE ! It completely hinders your ability to even play through the game because EVERYTHING is so pixelated if you will . Like I NEVER remembered this game looking so bad before , but I have to assume it had always looked this way but I was in a different era of technology then . HD TVs are completely unforgiving to these types of games . I 'm not sure if the the digital copy available on the PSN is any better , but the actual physical copy is not meant for a HD display even in it respective aspect ratio . Maybe just playing this game on standard definition TV might help , but I have n't tried that either . I will just have to remember the game like when I was young as the best PS1 game I ever played and then later the only one I ever beat . To the future gamers !	-1
I 'm going to fly in the face of convention wisdom and assert that Tomb Raider is not a good game . I like the concept , the puzzle solving and exploration . I like that it 's a great diversion from the standard shoot-em up . The problem is with the tedious game play . The game is tough , just from the mental standpoint and it takes some effort to figure out what you 're supposed to be doing in each level . But that 's part of the fun , figuring things out . Unfortunately , it 's moving through the levels and getting from point A to point B that is problematic . There are way too many places where you have to make a pinpoint precision jump or other move with absolutely NO margin for error . In some cases this means you fall somewhere and have to climb back to your starting point , or in some cases you die , meaning you have to start the whole level over again . And after trying one of these jumps over and over and over , you finally get frustrated and give up . There were instances where I tried a jump over and over , and then suddenly made the jump and had no idea what I had done differently from the previous numerous attempts . For any game to be that touchy is just a disgrace . It 's too bad , I think I could have liked this game but the tedious pinpoint controller movements ulitmately ruined the game for me . I know it 's one of PSX & quot ; greatest hits & quot ; and very popular , but if do n't like tedious games , you 'll want to avoid this one .	-1
I *hate* this game . Let me state right away : graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me . The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good ( and original , back in the day ) but who cares ? It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic , and their movements true to life . Who cares ? When War Zone first hit the scene in the late 90 's yeah , the graphics WERE cool . Not now , especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism.You know , WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new 3D level . A whole new level of crap . You see , it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for 10 years now are all basically the same . Let me explain why this is a bad thing.You know when you buy an updated sports video game ( such as football or hockey ) and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names , and maybe some new options here and there ? That 's exactly what the WWE has done with their video games . For the last 10 years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other , and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game.It does n't matter if it 's Smackdown , Smackdown 2 , WWE Raw for the Xbox , WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube , etc . Those games are all the same- a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism . I 'm all for realism , but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game . A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it . And I ca n't have fun with a wrestling game released today that , more or less , is exactly the same as a wrestling game from 10 years ago . It makes me sick to think 10 years later , hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games.Before WWF War Zone , you had WWF In Your House which , to this day , is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games ( along with WWF Wrestlemania : The Arcade Game ) . Before those games you had the button-smashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis . Once again , the formula in those old-school wrestling games did n't stick around and overstay its welcome . Over 10 years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much.The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N64 , it all went wrong . Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games , so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realistic-looking gameplay and wrestler appearances , and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach . It 's hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing . After a while you get sick of it.WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights , but it was the WORST thing that could have happened . Graphically , WWF War Zone is the first of its kind . Being the first means it 's bound to have some flaws ( despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw ! ) Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is . After the adrenaline-rushing WWF In Your House , we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly . Painfully slow , in fact . Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race . Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game . To be fair , the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed . Everything else is the same as it was 10 years ago.WWF War Zone also started the popular `` create a wrestler '' mode . But it does n't matter because , as I mention above , wrestling games for 10 years have had that option . It 's an option that has lost its charm because of overkill , and it 's time game companies got rid of it , or did something to drastically change it . It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now , 10 years later , I do n't want to have it in a wrestling game ever again.I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it , so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away . No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games.If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today , instead of repeating the same formula every year , I would n't have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began . After 10 years , updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers does n't get the job done .	-1
When I first got this game , I found it to be boring not too soon after getting it . When I play it today , I still think it 's boring ! WWF War Zone is the first real WWF wrestling game to be released on the Playstation . I do n't really consider the In Your House game to be wrestling wise , but more Mortal Kombat like.War Zone is based off the WWF roster from late 1997 to early 1998 , featuring only the most popular stars in the game . Among the wrestlers in this game , you can choose to play as Stone Cold Steve Austin , Shawn Michaels , Bret Hart , The Undertaker , The Rock , Triple H , Mankind , Goldust , Owen Hart , Ahmed Johnson , Farrooq , British Bulldog , Ken Shamrock , and The Headbangers.The opening of the game is cool , as you 're given a Raw like intro that used to open Monday Night Raw back in the mid to late 90s . From there on , you 're taken to the menu screen that 's in the form of an elevator . In the menu you can look at the wrestlers ' biographies that let you listen to their theme and see their attires they wear in the game . There 's also a Training mode on the menu that lets you pick a wrestler and learn how to perform their moves before you go into the game.Once you enter the game , you can either play Exhibition matches to get adjusted to everything or go straight to Challenge Mode . Among the match types available are Singles , Tag Team , Tornado Tag Team , Hardcore , or Steel Cage . The Steel Cage match is probably the most frustrating match to play . When you climb the cage , I did n't know what button to push to climb down . I pushed down but I just ended up climbing back down to the ring . I lost most of the Cage matches.Challenge Mode involves you choosing a superstar to play as and guide them to the World Championship . Unfortunately this was a boring and irritating mode to play . Once you play one match , you 've played them all . You have to fight the same opponents at least 4 or 5 times before you advance to newer ones . As you progress through , you 'll be met by a woman in a limo in the parking lot who will either show interest you for winning a match or insult you for losing a match . Oh yeah , that 's another thing . If you lose 1 or 2 matches , you 're automatically sent back to the beginning and have to start over from match 1 to go up . It ultimately screws you over and you 're forced to play a lot of the same boring matches again.Overall : I found War Zone boring then and I find it boring now . In my opinion In Your House is more fun to play than this . Even the sequel game to War Zone , Attitude , is more fun to play than War Zone . So if you do n't want to be bored , skip War Zone and buy In Your House or Attitude instead	-1
This wwf game sucks ... Boring ... Graphics are alright ... It was just plain awful EVEN FOR IT 'S TIME ! UGH this game was slo [ ... ] get this game..GET NO MERCY ! BEST WWF GAME EVER ! ... This game was very dull and boring ... If I could give it a zero I would ... THIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS ! good thing I Baught this for a 2 bucks ... .But still that was a waste ... Later	-1
Getting this game would be a waste of time and money . For halfthe price of this I 'd rather get a game that offers better graphics , better realism , and better everything . If you have n't already guessed it 's Red Alert . Even though it looks pretty good , after about a week you wo n't want to play it anymore . With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy ... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it . Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there & quot ; Red Alert & quot ; and buy that game ... You will have a way better game and not spend as much .	-1
Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game do n't waste your money.Uneven gameplay , and few options plague this game , it is also way too short even at this reduced price.Spend your money on a game , just not this one.Hope this helps , I hate to have games collecting dust , but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what 's what .	-1
I thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game . This was just a clone of red alert though . The people that make C & amp ; C need to come up with some more ideas . All the C & amp ; C games are exactly the same . I did n't like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worse .	-1
All right , the graphics are nice and the terrain damage is something new , but that does n't make up for the gameplay , which could be summed up in one word : SLOW.Skirmishes take a real long time to get going ; I mean , at least a half an hour before you can get a sizeable force . And then what do you find yourself doing ? Protecting your base with them , and attacking with missle launches . I 'm dead serious , the only way to attack is with missle launches . To attack with your men ( Especially tanks ) takes like ten minutes to even get to the enemy base ! That being said , the multiplayer is a total waste of time . If the person your playing saves you the trouble of teching and attacks you early on with engineers , consider yourself lucky . Do n't get caught up in a 3 hour game that is just about to be resolved , when you or your opponent loses his/her connection . And do n't consider engineering a cheap way to attack , it 's the only way anyone attacks ... THe campaign is allright I guess , if you can stand the poor gameplay to get from cutscene to cutscene ( Which are n't as good as Red Alerts were ) ... .. Come on , you ca n't tell me NOD does n't have a huge advantage over GDI . They do.Let 's hope Kane bites the dust soon , before the C & amp ; C series turns as twisted as & quot ; The Forgotten & quot ; .	-1
the game 's okay , although i do n't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea , plus at some points game gets outrightboring , and all the main characters smoke ... although the game will crash sometimes , and it might get stuck , overall , the game is pretty much okay if you do n't count crashes and how the characters act and look ... END	-1
I found Half-Life to be somewhat interesting , although it started to run thin by the ending levels . Not many of the levels were amazing , either . Just long hallways , small rooms , and an occasional elevator shaft that you climb up . I like 3D games that let you be outside , looking over vast plains of enemies and obstacles . Half-Life just did n't cut it in this arena.Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme gore/violence that is present throughout the game . When your science project goes wrong , you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground with about 10 gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor ! Were the programmers just trying to be sick here or what ? When you reach the levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts ( who are the best enemies ) , it gets even more grotesque . If you let off an entire clip of bullets at one guy , expect to see a wall covered with blood . Sure , you can turn it off , but it does very little good . The blood is still very disturbing . This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable . I am not a parent saying this , either , I 'm a teenager.Aside from the violence and lack of interesting levels , the game is pretty much void of any lasting qualities . If you want a weekend of pure hell ( both keeping you stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely ) then buy this game . Otherwise , do n't bother .	-1
this is the stuppidiest game i 've ever played . I advise everyone not to play it or buy it . It really sucked .	-1
this game is the hardest game ive ever played , and that takes away the fun . also graphics very poor even for nintendo 64 can not even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n64 game ever	-1
Banjo-Kazooie is a strange platformer , but ultimately misses the mark in all key areas of being entertaining . It tries to be funny without actually being exciting to play . All the attention on humor and yet , the game itself is hardly ever fun . This means children would probaly be able to overlook the games flaws and focus on the humor , which I 'm sure was Nintendo 's intentions- to market the game for kids and assume they would n't be able to detect the lousy game design . I guess the Nintendo 64 struggling to make a profit at the time meant Nintendo had to do absolutely anything to try and get *any* type of crowd interested in their products despite the poor quality we 're forced to persevere , so that explains Banjo Kazooie 's existence.Anyway , Banjo-Kazooie is basically nothing but an item-collecting quest with graphics that are admittedly prettier and just better than 90 % of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time . The waters , grassy lands , mountains ... everything is a beautiful sight to behold with crystal clear authentically pleasing environments . But seriously , why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time ? If you think `` That 's what ALL platformers do ! '' guess again : many of them focus on exciting enemy variety , diverse surroundings and a gradual increase in challenge which this game sorely lacks . The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks and artificial challenges . I found sharks you have to swim away from , crabs you can stomp on top of , and weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you 're trying to make your way across high paths without falling . These enemies only appear like 10 % of the time- the rest of your surroundings are n't very threatening.Let 's see all the things you have to collect . Honeycomb pieces , jiggy pieces ( mandatory to open entrances to new locations and you need to obtain a certain number of them per world ) , 100 musical notes which is a total ripoff of Super Mario 64 with the 100 coins needed to get a star , mumbo tokens used to cast spells , and jinjo tokens used to win vehicle parts . You can turn into animals and insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity , but otherwise nothing to get really excited about . Often you have to climb trees to reach the items on top and it gets boring after a while , believe me.Oh and the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you 're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it 's much harder than it needs to be . I will never understand why Nintendo refuses to fix water portions in 3D platform gaming . It 's mind-boggling . They did n't even fix them in Super Mario Galaxy 2 , a game released a good 10 years after Banjo-Kazooie . The characters are all forgettable , including the ponytail-sporting female bear and Banjo himself . Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch.Whereas the Mario series can be enjoyed by kids and adults respectively , Banjo-Kazooie is certainly intended solely for children and no other age group . It 's too shallow of a game overall to satisfy adult gamers . Banjo-Kazooie is like walking into the nicest looking restaurant in town and everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself `` Is it worth my time to return here again ? ''	-1
Not one of the best games . I would have rather played Mario just once . I only play it for about two minutes . I fall asleep afterward .	-1
When I looked for the game I was looking for this for a tear Play Station 3 . The view on this game I liked . When I received it was not discovered for version 3 , but 2.I am very upset	-1
I have played this game before and it is very fun ! That is why I came to Amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that I could go back in time and enjoy a classic game . However , I bought it from the seller & # 34 ; Warehouse Deals , Inc & # 34 ; and I did NOT get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them . Watch Out !	-1
This game is ok , but mostly mediocre . This is the best that the N64 had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil 2 ? Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark . The Sony playstation 1 had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage . This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be . The production of the game is basically weak , with the menu intro being pathetic , and the music repeating over and over and over on each board . The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running , but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission.Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated . I remember playing it with 4 other players all day for a couple days and never feeling into it . the quad split screen was a big nuisance . Thank goodness for online play today - the games today completely own goldeneye in every category , especially the funfactor.So yeah - there you go nintendrones - the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title . Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre - your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least . They have n't made anything decent since though	-1
I just wan na review out something no ones said yet.If you still ever play this game , it is a great game , it 's 5 stars , provided your into this sort of thing.But recently when i played the playstation version , i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the PC version and better version had.First off - There is no train . The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse.. sure , it may be useless to crash into another train , but it was entertaining . The PS version doesnt have a train.. but yet , it has the tracks for it , so go figure that one out.Next , lack of vehicles . The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town.And something no one can say wouldnt be better ... you can edit the PC version , not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself , but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools . You can not just add cars , you can add missions , put more cars into things , edit the exsisting map , or hell , make your own city from scratch.When I play this game , i like to ride around in Knight Rider , or maybe the General Lee , try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis ... gouranga ! Convinced the PC versions better ? Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking , huh ?	-1
mario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret places [ i think ] . I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i do n't like racing games . The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatified .	-1
I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE . JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL , PASS , AND WITH NO ITEM , THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED . HORRIBLE	-1
Rogue squadon is somewhat fun to play but the majority of the missions are hard to beat . the 3D enviroment is cool looking and on some levels there are places you can see that are straight out of the movie such as Jabba the hutt 's palace on Tattoine.The main problem i have with this game is on the Hoth and Deathstar mission . ( use password DEADDACK to get to them ) on the Hoth mission you wrap a cord around Imperial walkers to trip them which is tricky to do . As for the Deathstar mission , the scenery is wrong . In the movie Luke fires at the exhaust port at the end of the trench , in the game the target is on the ground . But that 's not what bothers me most though , After you hit your target it just says `` Mission Complete '' They should 've had a cinematic sequence where the Deathstar blows up . That does n't happen in the game which leaves you feeling angry and unsatisfied .	-1
Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it 's hard to believe I 'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best . The Legend of Zelda : Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment . Talk about a video game that not only does n't live up to the hype ( not even close ) but it does n't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype . This is a serious letdown of a video game . But again , please understand I 'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game . I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else . Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule , despite being presented as beautiful ( and realistic- do n't tell me Nintendo was n't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here ) it 's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness . Simply a means of getting from one area to another . A large , colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across . Nothing magical , medieval or interesting about *any* of this . It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house . Going into this game after a Link to the Past , you 'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies , pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles . Remember all those trees , rocks , grass and water sections from Link to the Past ? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked ? Ha , nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld . Oh sure the monsters come out at night ( in predictable spots ) but that 's it . As far as I can see , only one monster actually comes out ( named Stalchild ) . Terribly lacking . The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it 's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient . Again , where ARE all the enemies ? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good ? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I 'm really inside a castle now ? Give me a break guys . The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever . Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner , these castles are alarmingly empty , lifeless and unacceptable . But ... that 's apparently okay , because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels , right ? Not in my world baby . The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively . Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I do n't care about graphics in a video game , you got ta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing . This is just ... gross . Only the realistic-looking ( flawed ) overworld is a sight to behold ( which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess ) . Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons is n't much to admire . I do n't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings , trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64 's datedness . Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or , at the very least , forgiving . What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction , or having a game entirely too long so we 're forced to persevere these issues time and time again . In other words I 'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas . Sadly , it does n't . This is n't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have ( which I 'll mention below- keep reading ) . These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series . The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and can not be compared to any other game.Let 's discuss the dungeons , shall we ? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings , most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it 's almost a chore going through one generic room after another . Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead . When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you 're doing and where you 're going , it 's enough to make you think you 're playing with string puppets . Again , early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable . It 's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword . It 's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron 's for the first half , and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half . This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented . It does n't even feel or look like you 're going 7 years into the future as Link 's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he does n't appear to be much different from his younger self . Oh sure he 's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it 's very subtle . The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however . All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments , but melodic and memorable . Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting . The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game . The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and wo n't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches , or hopelessly generic `` I 'm stuck in a maze and I ca n't get out '' frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design . But ... these are n't any ordinary mazes . These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn , hence the flawed early 3D game design . A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be , or in other words , needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda 's so memorable . Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means , and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door . Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins . The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever . The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies , or rather , what little enemies you will stumble upon on your `` adventure '' through the temples , is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game . These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable . You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy . Why even have a sword ? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and , guess what ? *Now* the dungeons are exciting . A genius idea really . Here ? In Ocarina of Time ? It 's all about atmosphere . It 's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo 's most recent creation back in 1998 . But ... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day . What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design . Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable . That 's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it has n't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game ? Seriously ? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64 's limitations as a console that it 's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link . But even then , *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable . Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it 's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you 're running around . The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting . Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable . Ever ! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously , seriously . Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make , Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire , and Gibdos are boring . The ReDead 's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you 're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you 're stuck in a room with two of them . Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them , run behind them , and slice them with your sword . To be fair , some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it 's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there . The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat . And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees . They 're really not that important which is odd . This is the first Zelda game I 've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought . Not something to take real seriously . If you do n't feel like collecting them , then don't- no harm done . The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon . You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform . It takes FOREVER ( and no , this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you 're wondering ) . The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often . The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations , but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas . After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens , you get a beneficial reward . You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy ( usually found on walls ) . I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple . While the temple itself is really short and boring , it 's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight . You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch , and it 's really fun and creative . The hookshot 's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it 's annoying that it 's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game . Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot , using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while ( especially if you keep missing your target ) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you have n't noticed yet , the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable . I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way . Also , the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons ( mostly for warping from one place to another ) . Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times . It 's overdone . Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake . Do n't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times , if not more . I never really counted how many times I used it . It was a lot . It severely drags the gameplay , atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina . Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I 've ever seen . No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days . This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon 's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful . It 's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps , tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place . But ... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards . Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier . The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees . This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening . Another bonus point for Link to the Past . Oh and the Ganon fight ? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim 's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down . Remember how you fought Agahnim ? Yup , same exact strategy but in a 3D world . Sigh . The second part of the Ganon fight ( after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle ) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times . It 's really easy , all of it . However fighting him in one of the early dungeons ( Forest Temple ) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series . This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept . Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints . Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy . It 's better than most fishing games I 've played in other games I admit . Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however . Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them . That 's a rare compliment I can give . Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun . I do n't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm . If you fall behind even a *little* bit you 'll lose . Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you 're dodging fireballs . The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based . Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times . This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically , when compared to the 2D games , Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what 's available in Link to the Past . As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions . It 's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that 's really only able to handle so much . Ocarina of Time comes up way short . Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going . Avoiding being detected by guards is n't fun after the first time . Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people . The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon . Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters , these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen . The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them . At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times , and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda , trees and other semi-interesting characters does n't get the job done either . Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual ( that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here ) . I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating . The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here . Otherwise , Ganon 's presented uninterestingly . You 're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but ... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems , Ganon being a ruthless villain does n't ever materialize ( at least , he 's not as scary as he *should* be ) .Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist . That 's fair . It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now . By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories ( gameplay , graphics , replay value and excitement ) . I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey , nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day !	-1
Seriously , this ranks up with some of the worst games I have ever played . It is a complete insult to anyone who respects the RPG genre as this is nothing more than a linear , cutesy , puzzle game . You run around playing a little harmonica by pressing certain buttons in certain orders and the rest of the time you are moving boxes around , jumping from platform to platform , and killing enemies ( with an awful targeting system ) that respawn as soon as you leave the room.I can guarantee that about 95 % of all the 4 and 5 star votes are coming from children under the age of 15 as this is the type of game that would appeal to them . But if you are an older , more experienced gamer do yourself a favor and steer clear from this hideous example of a good title gone bad.If you 'll excuse me I am going to balance out my wobbly kitcken table with the cartridge .	-1
Seriously , it 's one of the worst games ever ! Terrible graphics , especially compared to the PS Triple 's , no voice acting , boring puzzles , and above all , it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game . Plus why is the main villian black ? That 's racist ! For a good Zelda game , I recommend Link : The Faces of Evil , The Wand of Gamelon , or Zelda 's Adventure .	-1
There 's many that love this so-called masterpiece , but the only thing I like about this boring/repetitive game is the great soundtrack . Sticking to the superior original .	-1
Miyamoto slacked off on this one.1.This is certainly not the best game ever . Not even the best game on Nintendo 64 . Super Mario 64 , and Perfect Dark both stomp this game into submission.2.This is not a role-playing game . Role-playing games have a lot of text and character involvement . This game has a script that is about two pages long , maybe less . What you say or do in this game really has no effect on the games out come.3.This is not the best Zelda game . The Legend Of Zelda , Links Awakening , and A Link To The Past are all much better games , especially for their time.4.This game is not 256 Mega Bytes . It is actually 256 Mega Bits , which is equal to 32 Mega Bytes . So sorry the game is n't nearly the size of a 650/700 Mega Byte CD-ROM.5.The game has no replay value , I played through it once , then about a year later , I attempted playing through it again , I could n't bare it , the game is just too boring . I played through Final Fantasy VII and VIII twice each , and those took alot longer than this to finish , they were both great both times through.I loved the good old Zelda games but this just does n't deserve the Zelda name , lets just hope that Zelda on the Game Cube does n't turn out the same way .	-1
Lara Croft games have NEVER been any good . I remember when the very first one came out 10 years ago . Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Lara 's pretty face . Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin ' market . The thing is , the games are boring and Lara Croft is n't very pretty.If polygon-breasted girls are your thing , go for it . But they are n't MY thing , and I know I 'm not the only one to think so . Lara Croft is n't good-looking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blocky-looking computer babe is n't going to automatically make a game any fun to play . I 'll give Lara Croft SOME credit . She was one of the originators of the `` running around half-naked female shooter/adventure '' type of video games . In fact , you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure , more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games half-naked chicks . Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that.Sometimes influence does n't matter when a game is really bad . This is one of those cases . The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke . I absolutely *groan* when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are , the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games , the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft ( which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game . Good luck- she NEVER jumps where you want her to ) and of course , mentioned above , Lara 's supposed beautiful face ( she 's NOT pretty , remember ? ) It also does n't help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful ( and appear frequently ) and , because of the jumping problem , very frustrating to complete . Trying to aim your gun at an emeny is n't exactly a walk in the park , either . The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point.By the time Tomb Raider 3 was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series . Now , these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games , but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it *drastically* , making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison.At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decent-looking background levels . I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Lara 's pretty face ALONE is n't going to get the job done anymore . I mean , at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good . Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course , and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight . But what 's THERE is okay to look at , at least.Tomb Raider 3 features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the above-mentioned jumping problem . She simply does n't jump the way you want her to . You 'd THINK the game company would 've dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game , but no , none of these new moves make the game any easier . The artifact-finding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it.BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games ( all these years I 've been watching OTHER people play them ) . Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation 2 , I see NO improvements have been made . Let the series END already .	-1
If you like the story then get this . For me , multiplayer is where it counts and I have more fun with Rage Wars . FRAG TAG IS AWESOME ! !	-1
Twisted Metal 3 is overrated - because it 's not normally considered the worst Playstation game . I ca n't believe how unfun this game is . The control is laughable . The gameplay is incredibly boring . The music is Rob Zombie , which is bad enough before you hear it 5,000 times in a row . The game also adds almost nothing new . Do n't even rent this one .	-1
The main reason that people hate this game is because it came right after Twisted Metal 2 and people were expecting A LOT of improvement , but the expectations were in vain . : ( The game is n't all THAT bad , I mean ... Mr. Grimm still cool , there is a new Viper car , you can use `` rain missiles '' as weapons , some of the characters and stories are VERY funny , the graphics were improved , the Rob Zombie intro song was AWESOME , and the London , Spaceship and Blimp stages were GREAT.NOW ! The reason that this game suck 's is because EVERYTHING in the game looks like fake plastic , the special effects are NOT shocking at all , you ca n't make ANY massive explosion or massive destruction , many characters look lame , if your car turns upside down you have to wait for 5 seconds for your car to stand up , and many stages are VERY small.P.S : This Twisted Metal sequel is terrible , but at least is NOT GARBAGE as Twisted Metal 4 ! ! ! That game was n't even a Twisted Metal game , that was more like `` The Circus War '' . X ( Adios .	-1
Having played the Twisted Metal series for a few years now , I can honestly say that Twisted Metal III , while having an initial gleam at first play , it wears itself out fairly quickly . The gleam I 'm speaking of is the slick graphics and the incredibly different game play . It tries to be something new , which it is , but it improves in all the wrong ways.Allow me to explain : Weapons Inventory . Instead of a max capacity of the total number of weapons in your inventory , you are limited to how many of each weapon you can have . For example , I can pick up 10 homing missiles but no more . The rest of my inventory has to be stocked with other useless weapons like Speed Missiles ( more on that in a bit ) . In previous TM installments , you could keep building your homing missile capacity , and carry only those , as long as you did n't exceed the max capacity . Annoying.New Weapons . Okay , so initially I thought the ( ( ( Rain Missile ) ) ) was the best thing since sliced bread . But really , the rain missile does n't do very much apart from visual appeal . The missile shoots into the air and you detonate it , and a ring of fire falls down like five mini-napalms . It does n't do the damage the napalm does , but only allows the cars to drive through so they start on fire ... at least until they turbo ( stop-drop-and-roll in TM maneuvers ) out of it 2 seconds later . Minimal damage done.The introduction of the ( ( ( Speed missile ) ) ) was the worst mistake of the weapon category . It 's a fast missile that has the strength of three machine gun bullets . If you can fire them fast , you can do some damage , but they 're so useless during combat that it really does n't even matter . ( ( ( Remotes ) ) ) are plenty but do much less damage than in TM2 . ( ( ( Freeze missiles ) ) ) ( the left-right-up maneuver ) do not hit enemies like they used to . It is much harder to freeze an enemy . This can be frustrating.Enemies . New characters are added , some are great , some not so great . Your enemies now have the A.I . that allows them to steal items from in front of you . If they need health , they will race you for it and take the health . This is especially frustrating when you are fighting Minion and you have one shot left to kill him and he quickly finds full health . *Cue controller hitting floor*The levels are not very large . Not much scenery and not much to discover . There 's a few hidden places you can find to explore , but for the most part it 's very limited.All in all , TM3 falls flat . The previous installments are much better both in game-play value , and in overall playability.If you can find this cheap , get it . Otherwise pass it up .	-1
Trust me , Do not buy this game . I am the local TM lover and know-all . I bought TM4 , TM2 , and TM3 ( sadly I ca n't find a copy of TM1 ) After i bought TM2 , I was looking forward to cool characters , cool battlegrounds , and semi-pixated graphics . I found none of these things . There are only 4 new characters , Club Kid , Auger , Flamethrower , and my favorite new driver , Flower Power . The levels , especially Washington DC , is a small open level , which is no fun . The North Pole is annoying , and I hate the boring London level . The graphics are cheesy , and 989 studios tried to make them look too real . The cars flip over with every tight turn you make , when another car hits you , or you drive onto a hill . This game is not realistic . This game should have 0 stars and is a disgrace to the TM title . I warn you , do not even look at this game . It is the worst . The car combat genre is in shame .	-1
To this very day I still can not understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much . Aside from the odd improvement here and there , the games have n't changed vastly ( I think Doom to Quake is vastly ) at all . I find controlling Lara very clumsey , the 3rd person view not help . Plus , Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting something 's head off from a distance is non-existent . I found myself fart around half the time . Where 's the fun in climbing up a rock face ? I 'm all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious . Oh , and Lara Croft is not fit because she 's not real and if she was she 'd fall forwards due to her massive mammaries . So stop ogling at your screen , you sad people !	-1
I recently tried playing this game , and by this point , my N64 is lucky it did n't get chucked out the window . The first few passes through the first few stages were fine , and pretty fun , but the rest of the game ends up being one long , annoying , tedious , impossible , and frustrating chore.To start off , the control just is n't good enough to pull off HALF the things you need to do in this game . There are instances where you must execute specific jumps to get you from point A to point B , but half the time , the controller is non-responsive . Especially when it comes to levels that put you high up , this usually means falling ... over and OVER again ! To add to this annoyance is the fact that there are no check points . If a level requires you to go to the top of a mountain , and you spend half an hour just getting up there and then you fall , you have to climb the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN ! So if you 're like me , and find your self wondering off cliffs every other try because of the awful camera work , you will be playing the same stages over and over with no payoff but one big headache ! Now let 's talk about the camera . Throughout most of the game , I found my self fighting IT more than I fought Bowser . It 's simply impossible to judge distances based on where the camera is facing at any given time . Pressing the C buttons will move it around , but you have to keep perfectly still in order to avoid suddenly gong sideways or backwards . If you are in a stage where there is a time limit or a complicated jump , this can be particularly fatal.Adding to this frustration is the fact that it is incredibly easy to over or under jump ! This would n't be as much of a problem if it were n't for all the levels which require you to get to `` the top '' of things . Again , if you fall once , that 's it , you start all over again . If the game designers were n't going to give you any continue points in these levels , why-o-why did they make it SO FRIGGIN ' EASY FOR YOU TO FALL ! ! ! ? ? ? There are plenty of levels and stages in this game , and lots to do in all of them . But by the time I cleared one stage , I really questioned whether or not I wanted to even GO to the next . Finally , after reaching a mere 52 stars , my answer is no.So that 's my two cents on this game , I ca n't beat it , I do n't want to beat it . I 'd rather go to a Morrissey concert with Kathy Griffin as the opening act than try to play it again . It would me MUCH less annoying than this game !	-1
I 'm pretty sick and tired of people calling Super Mario 64 a classic . It 's not . Just because it 's significant and influential in helping pave the way for future Mario titles does n't mean Super Mario 64 is deserving of its classic status , or that it 's any fun to actually play . Super Mario Galaxy came along and pretty much improved every single aspect of Super Mario 64 so you basically no longer have to play this game other than to get a dated taste of mid 90 's gaming history . The only other possible reason someone would play Super Mario 64 is because they desperately seek open world exploration , and this is basically the only Mario platformer that can at least attempt to satisfy gamers with that particular appetite . Not that I personally believe the game succeeds at the exploring aspect either.The biggest problem is that so much of the land you explore consists of emptiness . Oh sure you 'll see trees , ramps , castles , buildings , enemies such as goombas , chain chomps , badly and laughably animated thwomps lifting up and slamming down , pokeys , rolling boulders , and other things that have become a trademark of the Mario series , but the amount of items to find and collect is *extremely* limited to coins ( both yellow and red ones ) and the occasional power-up that enables Mario to either fly ( which admittedly is pretty fun ) or obtain the incredibly boring metal cap that makes Mario invincible . An alternative to the starman perhaps , with lousy side effects ( Mario ca n't jump as high or far while wearing the metal cap ) .When you 're not experiencing the endless disappointment that is running across empty and boring lands and basically doing nothing but wasting time , you 're jumping across a series of unspectacular and very ordinary-presented platforms over and *over* again . This stuff seriously resembles a beginners course for developing platforms . It 's extremely basic game design . The platforms are generic square-shaped tiles for you to jump across that quite often are all the same exact size . It gets monotonous almost immediately . Only unreasonable Nintendo fans would eat this stuff up , seriously . Anybody else would obviously be able to detect flawed , repetitive gameplay . The 2D Mario games move at such a swift pace that you do n't even have time to stop and notice the platforms ( unless you 're an extremely slow gamer ) . This is mainly because you do n't have to stop and situate Mario a certain way for the purpose of making the perfect jump which is what severely ruins Super Mario 64 's gameplay . And do n't EVEN say my skills are horrible when it 's obvious through countless youtube videos that several gamers have the same exact issue.While I 'm by no means someone who cares about the best graphics available , you got ta admit the ones here have dated horrendously with embarrassing blocky shapes pretty much occupying most areas of the game . The buildings , water and trees in particular are just awful for the eyes . Nothing appealing whatsoever about any of the graphics- even the bright inviting colors do n't lure me in but rather rub me the wrong way and force some of us older gamers to recall the unpleasant days of Mario Paint.You have to collect 120 stars in order to complete the game 100 % but guess what ? Many of the stars are flat out boring to collect due to being pathetically easy and basically being handed to you within minutes . What kind of challenge is that ? The one where you have to swim around and open treasure chests in a certain order is baby-ish , and the one where you swim around collecting 8 predictably located red coins inside a basic building near the beginning of the game is offensive . Or how about simply stomping a post into a ground to release a gate and thus , release the star ? Do n't even *think* about mentioning the ones where you walk up to Toad and he simply hands you the star . Granted , the game seems to always alternate easy star-collecting challenges with longer and more drawn out ones as a way to balance things out but that 's the problem- the stars are either too easy or too long . There is one star mission so awful it makes your inevitable death seem like something to anticipate- the one where you have to jump across a series of moving poles . You have to jump at *just* the right moment while making sure you 're positioned in the right spot . This takes forever and is dreadfully annoying.Also , what 's up with all the little baby games ? Grab a baby penguin and slide down a snowy hill ? Chase the bunny so he does n't hop away ? These are not suitable for anyone who recalls the challenging portions of previous 2D gaming such as Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World ( and yes , these bunny grabbing missions are flaws in Super Mario Galaxy too , in case you think I 'm intentionally favoring Super Mario Galaxy for no reason ) . At least the cannon-shooting parts are cool . It 's fun figuring out where to launch Mario so he can land safely on upper grounds.I ca n't help but feel the red star collecting is overrated . When you collect red stars in Yoshi 's Island , you feel like you 're given a really elaborate and perfectly executed assignment since you also have to collect flowers and stars to 100 % complete a stage . It 's a lot to do not to mention really darn exciting and satisfying once you 've acquired all these items , and constantly keeps your attention span in check while searching for them . Super Mario 64 basically takes that one red coin-collecting element of Yoshi 's Island and makes it a main priority here . You often have to collect 8 red coins per stage ( opposed to 20 in Yoshi 's Island ) to obtain one of the 120 stars . Ugh.But nothing NOTHING is worse than the fact you have to re-enter stages over and over again just to grab all the stars that are located throughout . To me this is unquestionably lazy game design . How can it be anything else ? Who in their right mind would actually *want* to keep going back to the same exact stage ad nauseam ? Super Mario World was guilty of this too granted but not NEARLY to this exaggerated extent . A terrible idea that gives a false impression a game has replay value but it 's exactly the opposite- once you go through the same stage a bunch of times and finally accomplish everything there is to offer , you wo n't want to repeat these same objectives ever again . So ... you probably wo n't want to play Super Mario 64 ever again . Even worse- when you often have to search for 100 coins to obtain a star . This can take up to 20 minutes and bore you the entire time . Being forced to collect 100 coins is a lazy way of assuring gamers do n't leave any stone unturned because you basically have to thoroughly search every nook and cranny of a stage to even *find* 100 of them.I also dislike how many of the classic enemies are n't included here such as the hammer brothers , buzzy beetles , bloopers , and cheep cheeps . Even the koopa troopa is nowhere to be seen ( well , other than that one race in the beginning ) . You can ride a koopa shell like a skateboard but that does n't count as an enemy appearance . He 's not a true enemy here . Why is that ? Why not include all the familiar and well-loved enemies that have become a trademark to the Mario series ? They ruin the pirahna plants by the way . Why is he sleeping ? Granted he comes alive when you get near , but it 's a really weird concept . At least Nintendo got the boos and haunted house right- a surprising and exciting maze-like high point of the game . It 's a lot of fun sorting through each room of the haunted house stages . *That's* how you design a memorable stage . Obviously if you were n't busy running around through several vast and average-designed empty fields of grass , there could have EASILY been room for the inclusion of more enemies . Hey I 'm all for open world exploration , but you have to actually fill in those areas with exciting , creative items that are both fun and rewarding to collect for the player , and enemies that present threatening encounters and a rush of excitement . Simply throwing Mario into a big 3D world because it 's his first grand 3D adventure truthfully is n't going to get the job done I 'm afraid . More needs to be done.Constantly having to rearrange the camera so you can see where you 're actually going is a nuisance . Nobody likes dealing with a camera while jumping around trying to play a video game , but granted , several games back in the mid to late 90 's were guilty of the same camera problems since developers were still getting their feet wet so to speak , and figuring out the best way to help players accurately and conveniently see what 's ahead . Still , you 'll lose more than a few lives due to bad camera angles in Super Mario 64 . I guarantee it . One thing I *do* like about this game is how fast Mario runs . It 's a fast-moving game , which helps going from point A to point B more convenient . Also some of the wall jumps and triple jumps are fun to execute . Reminds me of Super Metroid in that respect . Yoshi is teased in this game ( I wo n't spoil how ) but he 's not actually playable which does n't make sense . Why make an appearance if he 's not going to be playable ? The music is either extremely good ( the brilliant peaceful moodiness of the water theme and the intimidating and exciting heavy metal-like Bowser fights ) or downright horrendous ( everything else , which consists of annoying nursery rhyme children 's themes inappropriate and painfully skull-smashing for the rest of us ) . I ca n't STAND the theme songs that play in Whomp 's Fortress and Rainbow Ride- two unforgivable themes that make me want to smash my brains in whenever I play Super Mario Galaxy 2 where they return in all their overbearingly annoying glory . Rainbow Ride in particular reminds me of a county hayride where kids ride around on tractors ( not to mention the stage itself is extremely tedious and overlong ) . The snowy mountain stage with the Italian accordion music is sickening and out of place . Just mute the volume on your TV to make life easier for yourself . The boss fights are incredibly simplistic- grab Bowser 's tail , spin him around and toss him , or pick up/stomp other bosses . Basic , boring stuff.A few stages that are actually fun include Lethal Lava Land where the platforms convincingly feel like an upgrade into the 3D world from the original Super Mario Bros. castle levels ( not to mention better/more interesting use of platform jumping compared to the rest of the levels in SM64 ) , Shifting Sand Land since it 's packed with obstacles and enemies ( and reasonably challenging overall ) , and Tall Tall Mountain 's tricky climb to the top ( involving a vine climbing portion ) . In fact , to be fair , Tall Tall Mountain is one of the best levels ever in a 3D Mario game . It 's *that* good . Bowser 's castle levels are pretty solid as well , mostly due to the fast-paced nature of them.Several things feel tacky- the 1-ups and coins are small , dark , ugly looking , and clumsily made due to less than spectacular graphics and game design , and overall Super Mario 64 is just a really lackluster and highly overrated game . If not for influence , this game would have been forgotten and the superior Super Mario Galaxy series would have prevailed even more dominantly than they already do . Oh and do n't even mention the cake-eating storyline . It 's atrocious . The fact they brought it back for the Galaxy series makes me want to vomit .	-1
Let me just say that i think mario 64 is a okay game as far as gameplay and graphics goes but , every level get 's harder and harder it 's so hard it would take you months to beat it and by the time you do you would be white as a sheet from staying inside all the time and 50 % of your muscles would atrophy . also the ending really sucks it ends by princess toadstool saying let 's make a cake for mario then it 's over so do n't waste your time with this game .	-1
Even when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n64 old style 3d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds , espessially in pits . Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes . The graphics are terrible , the music is annoying and it 's just boaring .	-1
I 'll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out , with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity . I 'm more of an action person , not a sit-back-and-watch-my-city-grow person . Sure , Simcity 3000 is good for a while with it 's catchy graphics and innovative approach to buidling a city , but a few hours later , you 'll either want to fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor , depending upon whether the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year . I turned out to be one of the latter people . No matter how hard I tried , I could never get the income to come out positive . So , I did what any distraught and stuck person would do ... go online for cheat codes ! An hour later , I was bored . If you 're a thinker , by all means try Simcity 3000 out . But , if you 're a person that thinks actions speak louder than words , try Dungeon Keeper 2 , a game like Simcity 3000 , but not as complex ( and more active ! ) .	-1
I love Sim . games very much but I did not like this Sim . game . After I would have my little city all set up I would need to watch it like a hawk leaving me with almost no time to expand and improve on my little city . I have been told to give this game another try but I just can not find a reason to go back and try this game again .	-1
the only SHUMP on the 64 i figured i 'd check it out ... it plays like a genesis game with crude 3D backgrounds . not very interesting to look at . if you want SHUMP there 's only one system for you and it 's called the dreamcast . this one you can pass on .	-1
This Game Is n't Very Exciting.I Do n't Like This Game.It 's Boring .What You Do In This Game Is Try To Go Through Boring Levels That Do n't Look Very Detailed.I Warn You.You Wo n't Like This Game.I Warn You.Do n't Pick This Up.This Game Is Really Old And Just Such A Bad Game .	-1
This game was very poorly made ... it 's really boring , because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things . All the enemies are exactly the same , there 's never any health , and 100 health points are n't enough , because the health goes down too fast . The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog , and it all just draws in as you walk ahead , making it hard to see enemies . I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D , the game is very funny , and the weapons are hilarious ! But still , I would n't buy it . Rent at most .	-1
I only gave this game 2 stars because if you 're die-hard South Park fan , it 's possible that you might enjoy this game ... but I like South Park , and I HATED it . The controls are IMPOSSIBLE to use ( you have to use the C buttons most of the time ) , the gameplay is repetitive and boring ( all you do is walk around throwing snowballs at turkeys ) , and the multiplayer part is boring too . One pro is that the guns are pretty original & amp ; the South Park kids say some funny things , but the novelty wears off after a while . I bought this game when it first came out , for ... , and I sold it for $ 5 at a stoop sale ... I just wanted to get rid of it , it 's really that bad . If you really have to get it , at least rent it first .	-1
Konami took a bold step into 3-D with this Castlevania installment for the 64 . Unfortunately , it did n't live up to expectations , which part of it is because it was n't the same people ( believe it or not ) that did Symphony of the Night ( PSX ) . Read on to see why it 's a below average game : THE GOODFinally , Castlevania in 3-D ! Despite many shortcomings , the game does have some eerie music and a dark atmosphere , which are characteristic of a Castlevania game ( at least the newer releases ) . You can select between two characters ( Carrie and Reinhart ) that change the storyline somewhat.THE BADI was never a fan of the 64 controller and this is the one game where it hurt most . The controls and gameplay were difficult at best , and normally I have a decent tolerance level for controls ; Here 's where I absolutely loathed it . Getting your character to go where you want is quite a challenge for this game . Also , the storyline , aside from the two characters ' different ( yet similar ) paths , is really hollow at its core and does n't add anything new to the Castlevania legacy.OVERALLNot recommended . I advise renting the game only . ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A DIE-HARD N64 FAN . Otherwise , I strongly recommend skipping it . I 'm a big Castlevania fan and I feel that this game does not do the series justice . I noticed some people in their reviews that they liked this game over Bloodlines ( Genesis ) ; Why ? ! Bloodlines had far better gameplay and replay value than this ! Perhaps it 's because 90 % of gamers today prefer graphics over gameplay , when it 's GAMEPLAY that creates the game .	-1
game came on time and works . This game is pretty bad in my opinion I would stick to the 2d whipping action if your looking for fun . You choose from 2 pretty lame characters , camera angles are no good and the gameplay it 's self is not great . Get this game to add to your collection but other then that this game is a waste of energy .	-1
There 's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games . They 're on most systems , there are books , and even a movie . The story is a good one , but I found the game to not be so great . Graphics are alright , the sound is bad though . And game play is horrible . Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing , especially when you 're under attack and things are chaotic . The characters move unlike most games . You do n't go in the direction of the D-pad , rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button . It was poorly designed . But since the Playstation 2 is out , and better games as well as more Resident Evil , there 's no reason to pick up this game anymore . The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female . The game is involved , just not as much fun as it shoud be	-1
Was n't the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the all-time greatest Playstation games ? That 's what Sony thought would happen back in the day . After all , they promoted the game to death . Well look at that ... did n't happen ! And with good reason . The game is horrible . I ca n't believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or , especially , the Mario Bros. series.You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic , but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way . When you think about it , the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released , therefore Sony did n't even NEED a mascot . People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway ! Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist.You 'd think for a debut game ( a BIG debut , considering all the advertisements on TV commercials ) Sony would have made the game a *little* easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play . Instead , Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels ( impossible to complete AND find- I did n't even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet ! ) Even if you ignore the bonus levels , the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages ( such as the one where you 're crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks- a NIGHTMARE of a level ! ) All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away . A mascot debut game should n't have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game . Children will not like the nonstop frustration.I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot is n't remembered today the same way Mario and Sonic 's debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic , but featured in a 3D world . Think about it . Crash collects berries throughout the game ( Mario collects coins , Sonic collects rings ) . Crash has a spin attack ( Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crash 's existence ) . Sony just did n't have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different , and that 's why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot . When you already have the best ( Mario and Sonic ) you do n't need imitations.Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on ( not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation , however ) but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang . I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting , frustrating experience . Heck , just the fact that only 62 reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoot 's first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten . Add to the fact that right now in the year 2006 NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore . This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely , and not really miss out on anything .	-1
this game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either 2,3,4 .	-1
Naughty Dog and Sony released Crash Bandicoot , which rivaled the likes of Mario and Sonic . In the end , many gamers liked Crash 's non-stop action , but others simply just skipped it . Even though it was very promising , Crash 's gameplay did not really offer anything new , which featured elements you can find in a 16-bit platformer.You play as Crash , whose girlfriend is kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex . You basically just run through the levels from start to finish and fight bosses after each world . Even though the action is intense throughout , the gameplay becomes really tedious . Crash Bandicoot did nothing new for adventure games and it is n't really 3D since you 're restricted to one path . All you do is make your way through levels , dodging obstacles , avoiding enemies , and collect items and nothing more . The difficulty level is not exactly high either , and the challenge is severely lacking.Crash 's graphics are quite impressive for a PlayStation game , including well-textured environments and colorful characters . Effects like running water and mist and fog are great eye-candy . The visuals are the game 's only saving grace . Controlling the bandicoot can be a hassle since it does n't use analog . You 're forced to deal with sensitivity of the crosspad and at times will result in unwanted deaths.Aside from good graphics , you 're left with nothing but an average platformer equivalent to that of a 16-bit Sonic game in a polygonal world . While it may be 3D , Crash plays out too much like an old side-scrolling game of the past . I do n't know why would anyone want to play this game because Crash Bandicoot pales in comparison to other breakthrough adventure games at the time , like Sega 's NiGHTS and Nintendo 's Mario 64 .	-1
Augh ! I found the first few levels of Crash 1 harder than the 3rd world levels Crash 2 and 3 . It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next . This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or ... hell , I do n't know . I just had to repeat the level because it would n't let me continue.Also , there is no giant screen where you can save . You have to find the bonus platform , and make it all the way through the bonus part to save . Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus ? Sorry ! You 're just going to have to hope you do n't die or else you 'll have to repeat EVERYTHING . OVER . AGAIN.A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him . Be nice to your children . Buy them Crash 2 . Or 3 . Or games from the Spyro series , that would work too.If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it.. even though it 's dirt cheap to buy.. ( haha ) Put the money towards something BETTER .	-1
On hog ride . People has misplaced faces and they look like they took drugs . This game sucked . : ) Sonic is better ! ! !	-1
Ok , here are the reasons this game is BAD ! .1 . The graphics are n't very good and plus most of the levels look alike.2 . It 's frustrating , and there are millions of ways to die in one level.3 . You 'll wish you never had this game.4 . Most of it does n't make any sense and it 's un-imaginative.There . Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game ? Do n't get it .	-1
If you like orange bandicoots and video games , then get Crash Bandicoot , the stuff of dreams and legends . `` I am N.Gin you FOOL ! Face my destructive robots ! '' That is my fave quote . If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o ' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one , you shall find none other but a secret tele-port . You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense . Congrats .	-1
Everytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe 5 mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up I cant return the game I threw away the bag I wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointed .	-1
Overall , it 's a pretty good game . 1 star taken off because it does not feature the original soundtrack , and because of this many levels are silent or have different music . another star taken off because of load times , the graphics , lag ( come on , no amount of enemies should make a game like this lag ) , and the censoring of some levels . Also , no 2-player Co-op , only online which is stupid . If you simply MUST have it on PSX then you 'll enjoy it , if not then just buy the PC version .	-1
I bought it because it was cheaper than buying the original version which it is identical to except for item placements ...	-1
The Good : Decent story , tons of gore , great graphics and audio , new features are neatThe Bad : Abysmal combat , terrible control , extremely slow pace , laughable voice actingI tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond its major flaws . Flaws such as the abysmal combat system . You ca n't aim at anything ! The tank controls do n't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY , and with a lack of health and ammo you 'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window . The other flaw is the level design . Everything is so confusing and it 's so easy to get lost . The map does n't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.Another thing that does n't help is the game 's pace ... it 's sooooooo slow ! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish , menu are slow , text is not skippable . Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting . They actors sound like they 're fresh out of remedial drama , while the live action cut scenes are just as bad . The only good part about RE is the story , enemies , and the amount of gore there is . While DC offers vibration , uncensorship , and a few game play tweaks it 's not worth it . RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful . If you have n't played RE1 you 're not missing much at all .	-1
Although there are video games out there that can wow you , and then there are the duds . Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel . In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version , it really seems to be alright , but looks are always decieving . In the case of Nintendo 64 , there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel . This is n't really one of them.The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64 , seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel . The graphics are very strong , but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from , which is seven , not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game . Although the courses seem to be within detail , there are so many flaws , including th frame rate and the style of the game , especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C . Nevertheless , the game seem to be a little down and out , but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64 , it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64.It is kind of dissapointing that they could n't try to make some better video games with racing at the time , but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64 . If you 're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64 , I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64 , Rush 2 , or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World .	-1
I think it 's too late to give a review on this game , but here goes . This is the most perverted game ever made . When you think about it , it 's pretty disgusting . `` Aim for the open spot ! `` , `` I 'll do you fast , Peppy old pal . `` , `` Fox , get this guy off me ! '' `` I 've got a present for ya ! '' EEEEEEEEEUUU ! Should kids be playing these games ? Anyway , the gameplay is fun ... for 15 minutes . Then it 's bothersome , annoying , and dull . Your team mates have the worst A.I . ever , and they do n't get power-ups . The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short . Like , 30 minutes short . Also , the voice acting sucks.I hope Starfox Adventures will be good . This game should n't have started the whole Starfox thing . If so , it needed work .	-1
At first I didnt like this game , then I got into it . It 's like an electic boardgame . The one thing I hate is playing against the consol . Always play with four real people .	-1
This game is horrible . First , I bought this video & quot ; game & quot ; because I thought it was fun . Well in was n't . 1st , the graphics are poor . 2nd the computer 's difficulty level is so hard . If you play with one , two , or three people , you always lose . The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be , and it just degrades from the fun factor . So ignore the reviews that say it is so great . They are overexxagerating . My 8-year-old brother got bored with it in 3 hours .	-1
This game had the potential to be great , but the controls were very difficult to maneuver with , as your thumbs will become very sore after trying to move your character with the D-pad for however long you play the game . If you can find yourself a specialized D-Pad for fighting games , or one that can override the Dualshock analog limitations , than you just may be good to go , but you can easily take a lot of damage , and you ca n't save anywhere like you would be able to if you played any of the Doom games , or Quake . If you want something that will scare the jeepers out of you , then go ahead and play this , but if you want a comfortable game with horror elements , I think you are better off playing Doom 3 , Silent Hill , the original Quake or Resident Evil 1-3.These are my two cents .	-1
I bought this game back in December . I played it for about 2 solid hours . I come to realize that this is it . All the same levels are like this . So boring and so not like the movies , and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible . Not to mention the animation of the Aliens , they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure , moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage . The alien creatures are so predictable in this game , and not the least bit scary . The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling , walls , and floor is perfectly done , but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game . The PC game , ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this , and is true to the plot and movie action.Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game , I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it .	-1
I remember playing this game back around 1996 . I was nearly 12 years old when I first played this game and I thought , at the time , this was a really cool game . I really like the Alien movies ( mainly the first and second one ) and I was fairly excited to play any game based on my favorite movie.Now , as a grown up ( or maybe still a child at heart , lol ) , I came across this game again . Remembering all my childhood experiences with this game , I was fairly excited to relive it . Right after playing it for about 5 minutes , I started laughing at myself . I honestly do n't know what I saw in this game . The game is so horribly crafted that it 's really a surprise that they released this game at all . The graphics are ok ( given the time it was released ) , and the weapons are kinda cool . However , that 's all that 's good about this game.If you are buying this game to relive some childhood memories , I recommend not buying it because you 're going to ruin some good memories . Just keep it as memories , do n't relive it because you might see it differently .	-1
This game is so stupid like one of the revier 's said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door . And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before . This game is like doom , you know the one where you just see the weapon . Dont ' get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheat .	-1
The product arrived in its original case with game booklet . The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it . The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult . It takes some getting used to . The image was very dark , not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem . The in-game options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this . The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together . Overall i was not happy with the game itself . I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the product .	-1
KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES ! ! ! This game is old , and it shows . There is no Dual Shock capabilities , and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors . It really looks like it could be a cell phone game . The story is : there is no story . You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series ( the TRILOGY at the time , obviously ) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients . This game is n't very creative , or well designed , but it is classic . In the end , and as a fan of the Alien series , I must say DO NOT play this game . It will only alter your perception of the series .	-1
... In more ways then one , it trys to match the style and fun of Goldeneye , but fails miserably . Considering this game was made after Goldeneye , you would think it would at least have quality graphics , but no . Gameplay and control is horrible and frustrating , where it offers only one controller set up and one camera angle where you are stuck behind the character . The missions are vrey booring too . This game is very hard even on the `` possible '' setting and has glitches where you loose the missions at the end after doing everything your supposed to.Do yourself a favor and never play this horrible game .	-1
To sum it up , Sony did n't do that great of a job trying to find a way onto the ever growing RPG scene on the Playstation . It lacks a strong story , mostly . You run around reviving Genesis Trees to remove the evil mist that has transformed kind creatures to evil little monsters . That 's right an evil mist is your enemy . I as much a believer in the etherial realm of evil as most people but come on . You do n't actually expect me to fight mist . They try to tack on a final boss but he seems oddly removed from the evil from the mist so his presence makes little sense . The battles , though the engine is innovative , are much to long . A battle can last anywhere from 3 minutes to almost an hour . The main reason that the battles are so time consuming is because of the lengthy entering of the combat combos that your character uses . The game just stops being fun when you have been in the same dungeon for two hours because you are getting into too many battles . The dialouge is also very dry and foolishly written . After meeting the character Noa I knew that I wanted her to be killed by the mist . She is maddingly annoying , and she runs around like some mental midget on steriods . The other two characters have no personalities . This makes it hard to get involved with the game . The pluses . The aformentioned battle engine innovativeness . Also when you buy a new peice of armor or a weapon you actually see it on your character in battle and they actually use it . Their are some really odd looking weapons and armor . The bad part is that gold is very difficult to come across in this game . My words to you . Do not buy , do not rent , do not do anything with this game . It should be burned and its record removed from the planet . This game does not belong with anyone Playstation collection . Unless you are really hard up for some entertainment .	-1
Avarage rpg with long and boring combact system , less than avarage story , dull characters , poor dialogue and dull graphics . Dont ' waste your money in such weak product .	-1
I did not get anything from this product personally and I have n't enjoyed this one at all .	-1
Products offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand . Often they are unlicensed third party knock-off expansion packs . Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games . Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo . Ive warned you . You can save a few bucks and take your chances . Deviation from the actual product is n't even allowed on Amazon . Their very listings are a violation to begin with . Their feedback speaks for itself .	-1
I have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo 64 and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues . The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion Pak .	-1
I tried to like this game , I really did , but the controls are horrible and some of the worst I 've experienced when trying to shoot something . When playing I also wondered why it took developers so long to utilize the second analog stick and why it took so long for them to learn how to develop for the Playstation platform . While the story is well-done , it was hard to appreciate under the terrible gameplay . So I 'll understand if Syphon Filter fans hate me because of this review , but seriously the gameplay is terrible .	-1
This is an early military simulation type game , and pretty much obsolete , basically a mediocre pastiche of other stuff being done at the time . The graphics are supposed to be photo realistic but they are n't , the ideal in these types of games is that it should look like a helmet cam worn by a soldier in real life . Everything looks very matter of fact ... This is n't a beautiful game to behold . The psn version that I have glitches and freezes up often , I do n't know if that was a problem in the original or not but it probably was . The Gabe Logan 3D model is the worst that I 've seen in a ps1 game , he has a Sasquatch body with a Lego character face , and stands and walks like Sasha Mitchell . That has nothing to do with the limitations of the system but instead it 's a limitation of the artistic ability of the people working on the game . Controls are pretty close to as bad as it gets , very hard to steer your character , mostly worthless auto-lock targeting . There is some creativity to the level design , some okay variety , but there was better stuff being made back then . I stopped playing a level or two after the helicopter boss , because the enemies start wearing super flak jackets that take more than one clip , it turns into a head hunting game where you have to go into manual targeting mode and are left a sitting duck unable to move from the sucky controls .	-1
WAY too many positive reviews for such a crappy game . That 's what I think . Syphon Filter is atrocious . I received this game as a Christmas present ( gee , what a crappy gift ) back in the late 90 's . I thought to myself `` well , all the N64 players have Goldeneye , I can compete with them when I receive Syphon Filter for my Playstation ! '' How wrong I was.It 's not that the actual game is bad . I mean , walking around shooting people is fun , and it 's also fun to avoid being seen and make it to the end of the level without having to fire your weapon once ( and having to remain VERY quiet while doing so ) . The problem is that the difficulty is incredibly high and the storyline is about as interesting as watching the paint your baby brother smeared all over your television set dry.Without a certain special code it 's REALLY hard to get *anywhere* . The storyline is similar to one you 'd see in the TV show Jag . It 's just not interesting to me . Walking around shooting people is fun , but that 's all the game has going for it . Now imagine if that special code did n't exist where you can kill people in just one or two shots . The difficulty would be out of this world.I also hate the game for the bad memories connected to it . The Christmas I got the game , I had a few bad personal things happen . But looking back , Syphon Filter really is n't any good . It 's not surprising to me that the game is going for only a couple pennies right now used , and only a couple dollars to buy brand new . It 's not even worth THAT much !	-1
It 's a shame that the Sega Saturn did n't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console . You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something , but that 's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game ( and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too ! ) ? As far as the PlayStation version goes , you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM ( the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times ) . However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game ! If both players select the same characters , then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played : 2 vs. 2 tag-team ! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters . If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics . Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation ( another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM ! ) , this game is enjoyable enough if you are n't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much . I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait ( and hope ) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men : Children of The Atom , Marvel Super Heroes , X-Men vs. Street Fighter , this game , Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 . C'mon Capcom ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The game arrived early , which was nice . But when I played it , the thing would n't save . It played fine , but it 's hard to enjoy when you ca n't save . So I tried to remedy the situation by replacing the battery . However , it just made it worse . So I just decided to take the hit and toss the thing .	-1
i realize the vast majority of people love this game.A Link To The Past is great . I love that game , loved it when i was a kid , and love it today . And Im willing to concede that the original gameboy doesnt have the advantages of the Super Nintendo . Its understandable . However , even so , I still think the game has glaring flaws that I despise.For one , it feels ... cheap . I dont know how else to describe it , but something about this game feels unlike a genuine Zelda game . Between the plot , the fact that its so campy ( bow wow , the cheesy dialogue , the un-Zelda like setting , etc ) ... sorry but if someone told me it was a different franchise , i would believe it.Also , the item usage is just plain stupid . the fact that link has to equip his shield as an item to use it is ludicrous , especially considering there are virtually no opportunities to use the sword and shield together ; you will always be using some other item . The constantly changing items slightly bothered me in A Link To The Past , but in this game its even more annoying.The biggest problem I have with the game is this ; the overworld map . The areas are all so illogically layed out . To get to one area means going through too many others . Its not like a link to the past where everything was logically laid out ... it just somehow feels ... .too confusing . this game must have been maddening on regular gameboy.Something about this game just seems wrong . Sorry .	-1
This game is so oold you ca n't even get the graphics ! I suggets that if you did n't play this game but you all ready played ruby/sappire you will hate this game . I say wait for fire red and leaf green 2 come out it 's the same thing but the graphics are alot better .	-1
It 's a game . But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one extra star because you can do stuff , not just sit there and watch the lousey acting . & quot ; Qui gon , I have a bad feeling about dis & quot ; Well , it 's kinda fun , I guess . You get to whack things with yer light-saber which sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience are excellent in my opinion . Music even better . Gameplay OK. Graphics are not the best for now but very good for 1999 . You want a good Episode I game , try Racer .	-1
Boy , this game was a real disappointment . I truly expected better for this game , since it was based on a truly cool , badass movie . The main reason why it was n't so good is because of its difficulty ... this game was incredibly difficult ! Even with the Player 's Guide it was very difficult to beat ! The last time I played it was probably 2 to 3 years ago though , and back then I was n't as skilled as I am now at video game playing ... maybe I 'll give it a second chance . Still , its chances of not being sold or something are not really good.After all the reviews that I read , I thought that when I tried my buddy 's game `` Star Wars Episode I : Jedi Power Battles '' on my step-brother 's Dreamcast that it would [ stink ] completely ... but in fact it was the exact opposite . All the reviews I read kept saying how `` Star Wars Episode I : The Phantom Menace '' was way better than '' Star Wars Episode I : Jedi Power Battles '' ... boy were those reviews experiencing strong cases of irony . `` Jedi Power Battles '' was a lot more fun than `` The Phantom Menace '' , and it was at a good level of difficulty . Too bad I did n't beat it though , my step-brother does n't have a Memory Card for his Dreamcast . If you 're a HUGE fan of `` Star Wars '' , then do n't get this game ... you 'll end up destroying the game after you see how many pointless missions you have to go through and how many impossibly difficult leaders you have to face : 1 ) Jabba the Hut 's champion fighter , 2 ) a huge and hairy beast , 3 ) a thief who stole a part from Anakin 's podracer , 4 ) a Coruscant mercenary , 5 ) and ofcourse the incredibly powerful Darth Maul . Sure , it may SOUND easy , but wait till you hear this ... you do n't always play as Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi ; in quite a few levels you are forced to play as Captain Panaka and even ... gulp ... Queen Amidala ! Really , I 'm not kidding .	-1
I was hoping this was a racing game , but it 's an adventure game , so I am not very happy with it at this time .	-1
I just have to say one thing first : There clearly are not enough buttons on the N64 controller to make a decent variety of moves . Instead , in this game , there are about nine moves , most of them useless because they do so little damage . This alone makes this game so incredibly boring after two hours that I have to wonder what the creators were thinking when they made this game . Even multiplayer mode loses its appeal pretty quickly , because of the limited amount of moves . There are also a few too many items , and it really makes it less fair that you can use a big baseball bat or a lightsaber or a beamgun to help you win . Also , considering that the gameplay was n't good enough , the fighting environment takes a new approach at trying to add lots of detail and affecting play , but most of the battle grounds are far too plain for what it is trying to attempt . But I will say that the game has incredible graphics , each character and scene developed beautifully . I also like that in practice mode , you can change the speed of the characters movement so it seems like slow motion . You can make the characters go at normal speed , or one-fourth of it , making for a great amount of Matrix-like suspense . The two challenge rounds are also a challenge , maybe too great a challenge , especially with characters like Yoshi , who do n't get a jumping boost , but an egg to throw . The bottom line is , this game is simply a rental , because that is about the amount of time it will take you to get sick of this game . If there were more buttons on the N64 controller , and the game had more play modes , this game could have been pulled off very nicely , but for now , it 's just a short rental .	-1
THE GRAPHICS ARE N'T TOO GOOD , THE CARS LOOK GREAT BUT ARE LOADED WITH MORE HANDLING PROBLEMS THAN EVER BEFORE , AND THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS . LET 'S FACE IT , THE ONCE-GREAT RIDGE RACER SERIES IS NOW DEAD . AND THIS IS THE GAME THAT HELPED SEAL ITS FATE .	-1
I do n't see all the hype in this portable gaming device . The games graphics are so terrible ( So is Game Boy Advance ) . The only good Nintendo graphics is the brand new Nintendo DS which has Nintendo 64 graphics which is n't too shabby . But I really hate the Pocket and Color because it 's a waste of money . Why would you get something in black and white with terrible graphics and then get one with only some colors ( It 's not that good ) and plus the addition of bad graphics ... now that 's what I call a bad deal .	-1
The gameboy color was good but i really like the 1989 gameboy the grey one that takes 4 batteries	-1
not get clear about that game as nothing good , not work on code i try as nothing and is that fake or not kind code for this game ? i do n't understand	-1
Honestly , there 's nothing good about this game . The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for . The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation . If you like games with good graphics , do not get this game.The gameplay is n't that great , also . The N64 version is much better , because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic , and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles.I swear , play a demo or atleast rent the game , ( I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent ) and check out the graphics . Plus , in order to know the story of this game , you have to read the direction book . I ca n't remember it word by word , but it went something like this : `` Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth , when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of L.A. '' Okay , so the story sounds good ... but why was n't there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story ? And plus , all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard.I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously did n't have much money at the time , so they decided to make a mediocre game . This was bad . Believe me.If you want a game with good gameplay , excellent graphics , wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it , get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy.If you want a game with awful graphics , bad gameplay , no storyline sequences , and a Sega Genesis feel , then get this game.This game is not worth any money at all .	-1
I 've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time . I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes . Total Meltdown is the most frustrating FPS I have ever played . The speed is so fast it is hard to move . Looking up and down is a chore.You use L1 and L2 to look up and down . Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible . Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible . Sound is bad as well . The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook ( it is funny ) . The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations . Even the cutscenes are bad . Please try to avoid this game and save some cash .	-1
Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series . I use to own some of the Nukem Games ... I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks ... It was pretty sweet . The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station . The game play was kinda slow but still good . I do n't know if this is and edited copy of the game ... I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em ' cash..But they have stars ... Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color ... The one that matches there bra..The games violence is over the top . But still it 's a winner ... I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there is n't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence ... The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead . You ca n't do that in the PS1 version but that does n't really matter.Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them.I had fun with this game . It kinda pissed me off cause you did n't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it . Over all it 's a mediocer version.I do not recomend this version at at all ! Get the PC version ! Or the N64 ... I donno I just liked that version.It 's a great Duke Nukem Game ... Later ...	-1
Yes , people , this game sucks big time . This game came with the original Nintendo system back in late 1980s . I had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible . Most of the time you 'll jump off edges by accident . And who ... would pay ... to relive the nightmare of this game ? Apparent , 82 people who reviewed this game and my friend did .	-1
The quality was listed as & # 34 ; Good & # 34 ; It was on the poor side.Analog feels broken , and a feels buttons are sticky.But it did work 2/5	-1
Wow , Superman ! This game has earned the lowest review score I have ever given a game ( and I 've given some rather s***ty scores ) , and the second lowest score I have given a product I 've reviewed . I find it absolutely sickening when some of the people who reviewed this game ; like ShaqFu ( A guy who named himself after what many people would proclaim as the worst fighting game of all time and one of the worst games of all time , mind you ) , said that this game was a masterpiece and quote on quote , `` This is by far the best game on the N64 . '' WHAT ? ! You 're not serious are you ? This is definitely not the best game on the N64 , it is without a doubt the worst game to plague the N64 . That 's like the stupid people who say the that the God-awful Gamecube was way better than the PS2 and Xbox , it 's not an opinion , it 's the truth that those things suck . To show my love for the N64 , instead I will give you a list of my personal favorite N64 titles you should play instead of this:1 . Perfect Dark2 . Starfox 643 . Conker 's Bad Fur Day4 . Resident Evil 25 . Mario Kart 646 . Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater7 . Spider-Man8 . Star Wars Episode I Racer9 . Road Rash 6410.Pilotwings 6411.San Francisco Rush series12.Goldeneye 00713.Turok seriesetc. , etc. , etc.There , go play those instead . Those games are a million times better each than this game will ever be . Now let 's talk about the glorious Superman 64 in all of its greatness ! WHAT THE GAME IS : The story seems straight out of an award-winning movie . Superman 's friends have been kidnapped by Lex Luthor and thrown into a virtual metropolis . Superman must go save his friends and the world from the evil deeds of Lex . This game feels like a Pilotwings/Beat 'em up/Find the button game.GRAPHICS : The people who gave this game 5-star reviews said the graphics are amazing . Are they ? Why yes , if you think a game that looks like a PSone game made on a budget of $ 10 or it looks someone vomited Fruity Pebbles all over the TV screen , then yes it does look fantastic . Absolutely mind-blowing especially with the numerous glitches in the environments . The programming work done by Titus is stunning indeed . Superman can go through walls unexpectedly or can stuck in random places and will be unable to move for a brief period of time . Wow , Titus ! MUSIC : The musical score is truly amazing . It 's the kind of musical score that makes a person want to drown some kittens when they hear it . I want this composer 's hand then slap them across the face and tell them , `` Wow , way to suck ! `` SOUND : The sound effects seem like they were recorded in a basement . Everything is too quiet or it echoes . Another accomplished feat for the guys who made this game . Even something as simple as sound effects suck.GAMEPLAY : During my playthrough of the game this is how the missions went ; Fly through the rings ! Pick up those cars before those people get crushed ! Fly through more rings ! Pick up that police car and take it to the other side of the road ! Fly through more rings ! Beat those four thugs armed with guns ! Fly through more rings ! Use your ice breath to stop those tornadoes from sucking up those people ! Fly though more rings ! Go into a building ! Beat up robots and find a keycard ! Insert keycard then go to an elevator to another with even more robots to beat up ! Destroy those robots , open those doors , and rescue those people underground ! Go disarm bombs , and along the way beat up more robots , a tank , and a woman who has better skills than you do ! The repetition goes on and on and on . This game is very repetitive . Extremely repetitive to be exact . And very broken too . Overall , this game plays out like Pilotwings , except you break the controls , and the make the dated visuals even worse.OVERALL : If you enjoy life and do n't wish to pollute the classic N64 stay away from this horrible game . I 'm surprised Nintendo did n't do what Atari did with E.T . for the Atari 2600 . Destroy thousands of copies and bury them in New Mexico . Worst of all there 's a Nintendo Seal of Quality on the box . How did nobody stand up to say , `` This game sucks , '' that 's all it would have taken.THE GOOD : ( This category has been left blank for obvious reasons ) .THE BAD : Everything . Every single thing is bad about this game .	-1
If flying through rings with bad handling and a time limit is fun then buy this game . All you do is fly through rings and fight enemies on a time limit and with special abilites you have to find with limited amounts . It would be fun to fly around and cruise the city but with the time limit you would run out before you get anywhere . Even if this game was a buck it 's so bad it could n't even be a novelty . People who know this game might even make fun of you . Anyways I do n't think there will ever be a good superman game it 's sad .	-1
Fly threw rings and pick up cars ... this game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anus .	-1
Bad games happen all the time , but only the worst of the worst are talked about years after their release . Superman 64 is just one of those games . Receiving no positive reception when it was released in '99 , it is a laughing joke and quite a disgrace to the Man of Steel . This looks like a job for ... a hammer to smash the cartridge with.GRAPHICS : Bad , even for its time . Blocky characters compiled with glitches in movement and glitches in general . The town is full of 'kryptonite fog ' , which is just an excuse for the lack of perception in the town . Simply inexcusable.MUSIC : The same repetitive tunes , over and over and over and over ... STORY : How long did it take for Titus to think of this epic story . Pretty much , Lex Luthor traps Superman 's friends in a virtual world , and for some reason , Superman flies through rings and saves virtual people on his way to finding them.CONTROLS : I once recall someone on Gamefaqs saying that Superman controls like a 500 pound man on drugs . That 's an understatement . Taking off and flying requires lots of work , while Superman himself steers like a drunk driver.GAMEPLAY : Before starting a stage , you have to start a series of awful missions . For some reason , Superman flies through rings , rings , and more rings , and this is quite difficult with the godawful controls . After that , Superman does odd missions such as saving people from cars , beating shadows , or stopping tornadoes with his ice breath . Note that all of this is virtual , so why is he bothering to save them ? Then after that , he flies through more rings , does a mission , more rings , and eventually the level begins . The levels themselves are terrible as well , filled with glitches and the fact that Superman is super weak . He is the Man of Steel , yet an explosion is enough to kill him . After the level is completed , the whole cycle starts all over again . As with all Titus games , to fully complete it you must play on the hardest difficulty , which is just plain stupid.BUY : No ! Stay away at all costs and do n't let it corrupt your N64 . Well , if you are interested , get it on an emulator , because even paying a dollar for this game is asking too much .	-1
This is one of the worst games of all time . I remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it . When I was a kid , I did n't understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful . The control in this game is really bad , especially during the ring stages . You 'll just fly all over the place . The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly , but you have a time limit , so you do n't have time to move slowly . When I got to a point where I could fight , it was like a maze and had no idea where to go . The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only , and even then , they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrel .	-1
Nintendo power voted it the worst game everGamestop and spot hate itI was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store . I thought `` superman , I 'll have to try that '' . I have never seen a game more deserving of the following : THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER ! IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED ! ! ! IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE ! MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES ! IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS ! IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE ! IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED ! Somewhere far , far away , Superman weeps .	-1
I recieved this game for one of my birthday 's many years ago . At first I was excited ... but when I played it ... oh boy . The Graphics were horrible , too rough and generic . To make matters worse , they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.The missions were dull . Your first mission is to fly though magical rings . The Story is even worse , you have to save random civilians using various powers . The levels keep jumping , so your never in the same place.The multiplayer was kinda fun , but it gets dull fast . Basicly , it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points . other than that , this is probably the worst game I have ever played . Do n't buy this game ... rent it at most..or borrow it .	-1
I could go on and on , but look , it is really very simple . It 's hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly . They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it.So to all , always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff student 's idiotic post ( i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are cool ... White Trash that sums you up : ) have a nice dayAnd do n't forget , you hafta agree with me at all times , click on the YES button under my review , obey me , everything that has to do with good things of me	-1
This game does not , in fact , star Superman . It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman . Stuporman staggers like a drunken person , relies on power-ups for super powers , pulls punches so enemies beat him , likes random time limits ( including ones that lead to an instant game over ) , can pass through solid objects like they are n't even there , and can die from things that can not hurt the real man of steel in a million years , like ordinary bullets and explosions . He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman 's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak . All part of Lex Luthor 's evil plan ! If you love Superman , do n't buy this game , or you 'll be buying into a lie !	-1
When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited , then they delayed the release date , which usually means the game is going under even more improvements . When I bought Superman I sped all the way home , turned off my phone and sat in my chair . To my suprise , this game is not worth the plastic it 's made of . I do n't even have one good thing to say about it . I was extremely disappointed . Superman used to be cool .	-1
I did n't even play this game and I do n't own an N64 , but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people wo n't buy it since it 's supposed to be the WORST GAME EVER .	-1
In `` Kill Bill : Vol . 2 '' , David Carradine described Superman as follows , `` Not a very good comic ; not particularly well-drawn . '' Well , I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character , then the game must be cool too , right ? It 's been almost 10 years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system . It must be good , since we 're still talking about all these years later.Seriously , there 's a lot to like about SUPERMAN 64 . You wo n't need any sort of defect warranty , because the second you flip the POWER switch , it works every time . It 's refreshing to buy an electronic device , knowing that it 's electrical circuits will never fail you.Equally cool is that Superman flies in this game ... I like it when he flies . Every time I pop in this cartridge , I 'm even more eager to watch the Christopher Reeve movies ... all 4 of them.The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint . You see , there are bizarre , murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick would n't be able to visualize . For example , Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to , um ... a blurry contraption that kidnaps them ; or does it imprison them ? I personally could n't tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois , because it 's very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes . But is n't it neat to figure it out for yourself ? You see , because the graphics are so confusing and blurry , you get to keep playing again to unearth the game 's secrets . And do n't worry about completing SUPERMAN 64 in a short period of time , either . It 's a tough game , and there are few games that equal its challenge.What 's most remarkable is how the game also addresses Superman 's emotional state . I 'm sure Kal-El struggles to use his powers properly ; it 's not easy for a near-invincible alien to do the right thing 24/7 . Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully . You see , when Superman flies , he wo n't always do what the N64 Controller tells him to do . A free-spirited main character ... brilliant ! Lastly , Superman 's powers are present here . He has his eye-lasers and wind/freeze breath . That 's always neat , huh ? But what 's even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel -- - according to this game -- - has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists . He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky , and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis . How cool is that ? On the other side of this spectrum , there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditch ... ... you know , I still have n't figured out how to beat those sections of the game . I wonder , is there a higher power known only to Superman ? I ask , because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N64 entry . The most gifted scientists , researchers , cryptologists , artists , and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma.SUPERMAN 64 is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming ! *****THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL . I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BUY THIS GAME ! *****	-1
This game was soooo bad , I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from . I got it since I am a Superhero fan , but trust me , even if you are a diehard fan of Superman , resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free ! ! ! ! ! This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good.When i first turned the game on , the people in the first level looked like an oil painting . And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings ! ! ! Miss one ring and words show up that say , '' Lex wins '' and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldy 's laugh.I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at ! ! ! I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game ! ! ! ! 'sob '	-1
What what game I 'm describing . It 's old , it 's puzzling , and it 's a blockbuster game . It 's , you guessed it , Myst . And that is probably the easiest puzzle you 'll get concerning Myst , too . Since it is a popular game that was released a quite a long time ago , you 've probably heard of it by now . I 'll just say this one thing : If you 're deaf or impatient , AVOID . There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones ... heck , even if you 're NOT deaf , it 's still quite a puzzler ! But do n't fret ... you can beat this game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how , and it can be found in the many game walk-throughs of the Internet . After all , with the difficulty of THESE puzzles , rest assured , you 'll be looking for one !	-1
I can see why this game was so hyped in 1993 . CD-ROMs were cutting edge and the `` slideshow '' graphics are fairly good and so is the sound . However , the story is n't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely , irritatingly choppy.I do n't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help . There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.I do n't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it 's released before the necessary technology is truely ready.REALmyst ? ... I no longer care . Riven and Myst3 ? ... even more clue-less and annoying , I 'm sure .	-1
This game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of it 's length and puzzles , which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of Myst . While the environments were increadibly beautiful , they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay , which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles . The story is intruiging , yet the game 's ending fails to please the player , since , you 'll discover shortly after completing it , it could be completed in a matter of minutes.A good game for 10 to 20 dollars , but you should n't spend more than that on this weekend game .	-1
Once again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else.This CD-ROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket . I suppose little Tommy 's parents would n't give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copy .	-1
Others have commented on the richness of the sound score , the sumptuousness of the graphics , and the immersion the puzzles provide for you . All true . But I find people 's devotion to Riven and its predecessor a bit overblown.There are design faults here that should be pointed out . The 'slide-show ' effect when moving probably does allow sufficient computer memory for photo-realism while standing still , but it compromises the realism that the producers were otherwise attempting . Besides that , it 's simply annoying . Some have said that it adds a certain elegance to movement throughout the game , but I do n't like seeing my surroundings 'melt ' away as I move through them . Nor do I like sterile , empty environments . Oh sure , it all adds to the 'creepy ' vibe the producers were hoping for , but a universe which is largely uninhabited is mighty boring after a few hours . I wanted wayyyyy more interaction with people than I got here.I also wanted to understand why I was doing what I was doing . Oh I could solve the puzzles , given gobs of time and guesswork , but at the end I found the plot rather too spare for the amount of work invested . If I 'm going to spend weeks solving puzzles , I better understand more at the end of the story than at the beginning . I 'm not altogether sure that happens here . The universe here , for all of its graphical excellence , left me hungry for more . Clearly , this is an entertainment crafted by fine artists rather than fine writers . If you 're happy with that orientation , you 'll be overjoyed with the final product . But if , like me , you want a game to surround you with an active , vibrant plot revealed by characters of substance , Riven is n't much of an adventure .	-1
not worth 10 cents , graphics are very poor for nintendo 64 The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick . The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die . Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring . After level 2 there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it . A much better version of this is availible on the ps1 . definately dont waste any money on this game , it down right sucks	-1
Oh , here they come ! Can you hear it ? The wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an RPG ! I can certainly hear them , because I 've been listening to them for the past few years . I will admit , I was excited to play this game at first , seeing as I never played it before Christmas of 2008 ... but honestly , I wish I had never played it at all . Why ? Well , stick around , sit back , shut up and read.STORY : 2/10Atrocious . Simply atrocious . You start the game as an ex-SOLDIER named Cloud ( default name , seeing as you have the option to name your main character ) , who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE . Why these groups and names have big , capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me , seeing as they do n't stand for anything . Along the way , you 'll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what you 'll be doing in the current area you 're in , get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters , and finally come to the climax of the game , facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutes ... but not because it 's hard . It 's not . I have so many problems with this game 's story ... okay , I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD . You get a total of 9 characters in your party , and guess what ? Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever ! The only reason they exist is for party-filling , seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something to ... well , ANYTHING . Two of them you do n't even technically have to get in your party to begin with ! You can literally beat the entire game -- all 13-17 hours of it -- with the drooling retards you pick up along the way . The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story , and everywhere you turn , you can see something you can bitch about for hours . Party members included.GAMEPLAY : 1/10Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time . There 's seriously nothing revolutionary about this game . It 's the same boring , lazy turn-based system you 're used to , except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable . The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched , and every time you use an attack , skill , or spell , you 'll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass . Oh , and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materia ... well , I certainly hope you stocked up on food , drinks , and toilet paper ; you 'll be sitting there staring at the atrociously-long summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move.PRESENTATION : 0/10What are you talking about ? This game is CLEARLY not even finished . Do you know how many glitches , bugs , and excruciating errors I found while playing this game ? Hundreds . The sickest part ? I did n't go out of my way to find them . They came to me . The character models look ridiculous , nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game , the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchise 's name , and you 'll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two . Or ten . Not only that , but the game is WAY too easy . I literally played through the entire game -- story and all -- in less than 20 hours . In that time , I never once died or even lost a member of my party ( if you 're not counting Aeris , seeing as she dies in a cutscene ) . And hey , if you 're having trouble with something , just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls , gain infinite money and items , level your entire party up to 99 in a single fight , deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit , or even reset every single in-game switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats , items , and equipment you already have . But seriously , who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once ? This unfinished , broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time.SOUNDTRACK : 0/10What soundtrack ? It 's just a bunch of clicks , screeches , and otherwise infuriating sounds . It 's not music . It 's a collaboration of anger-inducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds , or your money back ! GUARANTEED ! OVERALL RATING : 1/10This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did . It 's especially lucky that Amazon.com 's ability to rate its products only comes in five stars . If it was a standard 1-10 rating , I 'd hack my computer to give it less than .5/10 , seeing as I ca n't stand this absolute travesty of a video game . It 's a downright abomination to the world , and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy , like myself . I 'm glad I did n't play this game until years after it came out . If I had played it back then , I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time . You ca n't rate a game based on how well it sold , and you ca n't rate a game depending on the graphics . Why ? Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review . I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it ; it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon . It 's not worth a penny out of your pocket .	-1
oh hey those pixelated shemales are gon na save the world over 701251709 hours of boring gameplay ! this game super mega dumb .	-1
Are you joking . This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion . Man , are you guys even trying anymore ? I looked at final fantasy x-2 and rented it and gosh , you cant even make a good game out of that.Man..bad graphics , horrible gameplay , sucky battle system , hard to understand , VERY difficult to get into it , too confusing , dumbxxx characters like cloud , hes the worst . ( except sephiroth ) , sometimes too long of cutscenes , boring cutscenes , you can barely see their eyes & amp ; mouth , etc . etc . etc . etc . times a million.I hate this game .	-1
everyone did love this game I just did n't like it I 'm not a huge turn base RPG fan if I where though this would be a fun game it was enjoyable but very long	-1
I 'd like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game . The main character , Cloud , is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games ( like Kingdom Hearts ) so I was really interested in trying it out . That , coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN , which quotes that FFVII is `` The RPG by which all others are to be measured , FFVII is a cinematic wonder '' had me thrilled to try this out . For some perspective , IGN quotes my favorite game of all time , Zelda Ocarina of Time , as `` IGN64 reviews the biggest game of the decade . Does Zelda 64 live up to the hype ? '' I never owned a PS until the PS2 & PS3 , so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for $ 9.99.Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game , I 'll provide a little bit about my gaming style/history before I go into the game review . I 'm a huge RPG fan , and I like a variety of games in that style ( turn-based , timer , real time strategy , action ) . I 've played a few FF games ( III , X , Tactics , Tactics II ) , and I liked them all , except for X , which I found to be a little too easy , albeit very pretty . I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games . I 've been into video games since I was 5 , and apart for a work-induced stint of abstinence in college , I still enjoy video games when time permits.As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself , it must get better . It 's just a slow start , surely the story picks up ? I pushed on for a few hours , going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job . I 'm glad I only spent $ 9.99 to try this game out , and not $ 100+.Graphics : I 'm not sure what IGN is talking about , but these graphic are terrible . Yes , I know the game is from 1997 , but Zelda OCT came out in 1998 and it 's graphics have held up to the test of time much better . Although the PS and N64 ( pre-graphics expansion ) are supposed to be comparable , a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross ( 1999 PS ) . The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch . Also , since it was being released on the PS network , Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics ( like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube ) instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs . Maybe it would look better on an old TV ? Who knows . The cut scenes have slightly better graphics , which are almost comparable to Zelda OCT 's in game graphics.Story : I was n't really impressed by it , although it it 's an interesting concept . I 've done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers wo n't have the story spoiled for them.GOOD/Unique : When you boil it down , you are basically fighting as an eco-terrorist , and that 's an interesting concept.BAD : The character integration into the story is very poor . When you look at all the character 's background stories , it does n't make sense that they are all working together . If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECO-terrorists it would fit better . Aside from the fact that they are all eco-terrorists who live in the same beat down community , they really have nothing in common.I did not like the characters I had been introduced to , before I quite playing . Cloud is incredibly angsty and self-centered in the beginning , and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant . His friendship with Tifa does n't make much sense to me either . Tifa is a sweet person , and portrayed as kind-hearted , yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally . Barret , um , can we say racist ? Barret , the only black person in the game , consistently beats his chest like a gorilla . Yes , let 's make the black person look and act like a gorilla.Gameplay : Mediocre.This is the most important part for some people , although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important . For me , if the story is bad , it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game . The game play here was average , it has a pretty typical timer set-up , nothing to write home about . I 'm not sure if this game invented timer play , if so Kudos to Square Enix . The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions , so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play . Once I figured out the game play though ( ~1hr of game time , most of which is scenes ) I quickly grew tired of this game.Summary : This game has average game play , terrible story , horrific graphics even for a late 90 's game , and pretty pathetic characters . I played for 3-4 hours and then gave up on it . My free time is limited , and I do n't waste time on games that are n't fun because `` they might get better . '' Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour 4 . All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game , and I 'm quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites.UPDATE : Barrett - when Cloud is introduced to headquarters , Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing . However , his overall portrayal may not be that racist , as I only played for 4 hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game.Despite the comments and emails I 've gotten about this review , I still leave it as 1-star . Without the nostalgia goggles I did n't enjoy the story , the graphics , the gameplay , or the characters .	-1
For years now , gamers have said that this is one of the greatest games ever made.I just do n't understand why they think that is.Even for it 's time , it was pretty dull and boring in my opinion.I remember dropping 50 bucks on this game when it first came out back in 1997 , and being very dissapointed with it.The main problems I have with this game are the graphics ( except the cinematics ) , the gameplay and some other elements.One of the main things that I hated about FF7 is , there is absolutley NO speech in this game at all.You have to read everything that the characters are saying.It gets very iratating VERY fast.All you do is read , read , read ... and read some more.The combat system is way beyond confusing.It 's all about they hit you , then you hit them , then they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill you.The only good thing I can say about this game , is the cineamatics are beautiful.They are very nice to watch , but the characters and surrounding areas are very blocky looking ... Overall , I give FF7 a two .	-1
When I first bought my PS2 , I got FF10 , FF9 , and FF7 . That was back in 2002 . FF10 & FF9 I liked . Good stories & loveable characters . But FF7 was a drag.Then I saw all the positive reviews ( `` best game ever '' ) , so I decided to give FF7 a second playing in 2004 , to impress me . But I still did not like it . IMHO the major flaw is that FF7 has too many `` dry '' sections where you fight-fight-fight and almost nothing happens storywise ( example - climbing the 100-floor building of your enemy -or- the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress ) . In some sections , literally hours pass by with no story ... it feels like a step backwards to the near-nonexistent stories of the original nintendo..Also the Battle Engine - totally unbalanced . A good RPG will provide balance between physical & magical attacks , so they are near-equal . A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills & weaknesses ( like real people-some are fighters ; others are healers ) . Not so FF7 : - it 's all magic ... physical attacks are worthless ( about 1/4 the damage ) - and the characters are completely interchangeable . You can equip Fire3 to your man & Heal3 to your girl . And then the next battle , completely flip it around , so the man is the healer & the girl is the killer . And then flip it again ! No individuality . Each character is identical . Plus *instant learning* and instant forgetting ... not realistic at all..Also , the story , while good , is poorly executed . It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planet 's `` health '' - very simple concept - but the writer dances around & adds un-necessary complication . He takes 2+2 = 4 and turns it into 1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4 . That 's why so many gamers go , `` Huh ? What just happened ? '' It was a good story , but a lousy script.Overall , FF7 is one of the weakest games in the FF series ( inferior to the other PS1 game-FF9 , super nintendo games FF4 , FF5 , FF6 , even inferior to FF10 .	-1
I got the PC version of this game and its A far cry from the others in the NFS series . The graphics are horrid , the cars are weird not more normal cars like the ferraris or jaguars in the other need for speeds . The cars are hard to control , its way to easy to spin out and crash . The menu controls are hard to use to , for instance most of the options dont have A pull-down menu you have to cycle through all the options . If you want great racing get Need for Speed 3 , High Stakes , or Porsche Unleashed .	-1
If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT . I beat the game as I got it once I discovered `` the formula '' ... I 'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundownPros1 ) Characters are unique and fun with personality , i.e . personal story , ending etc ( missing from PS2 ) 2 ) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive3 ) The moves and effects are radical ( King Capcom shines here ) 4 ) Fast action5 ) Cool Japanese voicesCons1 ) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game ! ! 2 ) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula ! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula ! ! OverallOverall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game . The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed . Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast , read my review !	-1
The Resident Evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mid-90 's . It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception . It 's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult , rather , it 's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.Why do some zombies take more bullets than others ? Why do zombies respawn in some areas ? What 's up with all the backtracking in this game ? You 're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE ? These are some of the questions you 'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica . Has the series evolved ? If you get past the improved graphics , the answer is NO . The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1 , albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode ( you burn through bullets faster this way ) . A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required , which may have been good back when the series was young , but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable ! The game has a rather cartoonish look to it ... could have looked more realistic but then again , the Dreamcast is n't exactly a graphics powerhouse . My suggestion ... do n't buy it . Granted , I 've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV , but trust me , this is a BORING game ! Get Shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better story !	-1
If you like the original Resident Evil you will probably like this one for the most part . However , I liked the original Resident Evil , but found : Code Veronica extremely annoying.The annoying part has nothing to do with the game itself . The puzzles are a bit bothersome at times , but nothing to complain about . The graphics are n't bad and the story line works pretty well.The BIG problem I have with the game is the play control . The editorial comment says & quot ; less than perfect controls & quot ; , well that is an understatement . You have to hold down the right trigger to use your weapons , this makes firing while running and firing while retreating overly complex . Moreover , you have to go into the menu screen every time you want to pick up or use an item . There just had to be a better way.Most of the time I would say that the play control only diminishes the fun of the game , but does n't ruin it . However , in this instance it does . The control sucks the fun out of the game just as the zombies do the blood out of your neck , while you are fumbling around with the controller . The game is n't very difficult , but the play control makes the game more work then it is worth .	-1
Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake ! The game looks great and sounds great , but its too easy . The game that is supposed to be the game for & quot ; die hard fighting fans & quot ; is basically a walk in the park . The game is a button masher ! I played the game and found that & quot ; turtling up & quot ; and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines . No God fearing person should touch this & quot ; demon sword wielding & quot ; game ( I began to discover the different plots after I played it ) . I 'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game . What sick minds came up with this anyway ? If the game had a better plot ( one that involved some thought ) then it would be a classic , but as it stands ... no .	-1
Plodding first-person shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses . One-player missions are tedious . Only redeemingfeature is to play the two-player game with other & quot ; South Park & quot ; fans , and then only if you 've gotten the codes to unlock favorite characters.Even with friends , you 'll tire of it in a day .	-1
People , i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game.This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window.The games has most of the characters ( whoopie ... ) which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring.I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay.If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is.Avoid this nerf dung at all costs .	-1
I played this on the N64 when I was a kid and it was funny and hilarious . The problem with that is ... This is n't the N64 . This Playstation version sucks ! There 's only about half the weapons and half the maps or the N64 version . This is more like a demo !	-1
I simply find the game ordinary and boring . I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.Man I was dissapointed ! There is nothing new in the game . It is simply an ordinary shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.Admitted : There are a few funny features in the game , the cow-shooting gun , Mr. Hanky the christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short while.My advise is : Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for something else .	-1
WWF Attitude , although a good game do n't get me twisted , was not worth it on the Playstation because of the incredible loading time . ... Seriously , if you picked Owen Hart , Gangrel , Road Dogg or even Kane or the Undertaker , you had to wait atleast 2 sometimes exceeds of 3-4 minutes just to get a match started . And if you picked a hardcore or cage match , sometimes , you had to wait even longer.The trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason . Granted yes what you got on the Playstation version rather than the N64 version was better . PSone had more sounds , more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes . Because of PSone 's memory capability , the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the 64.I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version , the game itself was faster than N64 's version but still , anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game . The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it , you 're golden and you do n't have to worry about a thing.For the game itself I will give a 4 star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time I give WWF Attitude a zero . ...	-1
THIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED . THANK GOD FOR THQ . IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD . DO N'T RENT THIS GAME , DO N'T BUY THIS GAME , DO N'T EVEN ASK FOR IT . THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS , THE VOICE OVERS SUCK , CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS . EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS . DO N'T BUY IT .	-1
Although I most confess that I did enjoy this game at first ( At first , meaning from beginning to end ) , I was happy with big areas to explore , and really enjoyed the Nemesis ( although it was no more different that that bald stalking guy of the inverted RE2 ) hunting you down , I most say this game is a fraud in what concerns story line structure , which on its own right , is the main mover of any story-based game.I 'm going to simulate here the general structure RE3 ( and RE2 and RE , although this is acceptable in the original game ) follows : & quot ; So , how did these creatures end up here ? let 's search the whole place while we try to get out of here . Look out ! ( Lots of guns , blood and guts follow ) Wow Jill , that was close ! Hey , he was supposed to be our friend ! He turns out to be a traitor ! Hey look , a secret lab within the main place , ( House , Police Station , City or any other place of your fancy ) let 's check it out ! Oh no , this is the truth behind the monsters ! We most stop Umbrella . Darn ! This place is about to explode , let us get out of here ! Look out , a big mean monster ! ( More guns , blood and guts follow ) Yeah ! We did it ! Our heroes escape a few seconds before the whole place blows up . Fin & quot ; Wow , we have a new Resident Evil game here ! My point here is : This game features the same story line structure of the past two games , only this time we get to play before and after RE2 . That dirty trick was Capcom 's strategy to make the game 's storyline a little bit different and engrossing.I ca n't comment on Code Veronica , for I have n't played it yet , but I think I will do so when it gets out for the PS2 , but for what I can see , the RE series is going down the drainage . I will consider Resident Evil 4 depending on many aspects . I might be playing this game ( along with RE2 ) again when I get me a PS2 , but surely , I wo n't touch it again in the near future.There is more to horror gaming than just guns , blood , guts and linear story line .	-1
Resident evil 2 , may i say , is one of the best games of all time . So was re1 , re0 , and re code veronica . But not resident evil 3 . First of all , whats with the difficulty mode ? ! ! U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with , or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough . But the worst part is the tyrant . It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore . It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly ! He 's hard to kill and always comes back . Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast . It takes away from the fun of the game . Forget this game and try resident evil 2 or one of the others ... .. you will thank me later .	-1
This is definetly a misleading title , it 's more like Resident Evil 2.5 . I mean looking at the improvment between RE1 and RE2 , this thing is more like a side story . In fact it should have been the third disc in RE2 , then there would be Jill , Claire , Leon . I did enjoy nemesis , he certinely scared the heck out of me every now and then , plus you have that added preasure while playing the game that hes stalking your every move . But I mean come on , the story takes place at the same place at the same time , when I firsted played the game I was like & quot ; Have n't I played this before ? & quot ; The worst thing was the lack of story , after completeing both Claire and Leon discs in RE2 , I was expecting more secrets & amp ; lies with the whole umbrella conspisy , and a rule of a trilogy is going back to the begining ( Jill ) and finding out something that was n't true in the first place , but I did n't get diddly squat . And the whole thing just got repetitive without the story to drive me to find out what happens in the end . I really wish I had a Dreamcast so I could enjoy Code Veronica , the true Resident Evil 3 .	-1
What the Resi series of games does , it does well - OTT Hollywood-style scares and genetically-mutated things that go Bump In The Night . RE 3 is no different , providing more of the same for fans who love it . It also boasts one or two gameplay improvements , but somehow ca n't quite get back to the glory days of the first 2 games in the series.The plot follows the heroine from the first game , Jill , 24 hours before and after the devastating outbreak of the T-Virus in RE 2 . A novel concept , and one which Capcom surely intended to exploit fully . The inclusion of the Nemesis character , a Frankenstein-like monster who relentlessly pursues you from start to finish , is also a nice twist , adding much-neede dtension to the game whenever he makes an appearance . The menus and controls are also tweaked , most notably the inclusion of the 'Turn ' and 'Dodge ' features , which , if learned properly , add hugely to the gameplay.Graphically RE 3 is as good as RE 2 . It 's as detailed , and lush as before . The intro is strangely disappointing , being lo-res and choppily animated - the PlayStation 1 's power is being overused . The sound is good , though , and the gameplay is the best possible version of an imperfect control system.The problems with RE 3 lie mainly in the game 's production . It 's nigh-on impossible to keep track of yourself for the first thirty minutes or so , and the map for this portion of the game is difficult to spot . The baddies are souped-up versions from the previous games and are actually too difficult to kill initially . You waste precious ammo and health packs before you realise that you can take multiple paths . Also , Nemesis , though an excellent inclusion , is again too intense for the early stages of the game , and more often than not you 'll find yourself cursing Capcom while waiting for your game to reload after he 's dispatched you . Again.As the game continues , you realise that the baddies have an unfair advantage over you , and you will end up running past the majority of them . The satisfaction of knowing a Zombie is cornered just is n't there anymore . You also miss out on some beautiful backdrops and vitally important clues becuase you 're too busy avoiding some ridiculously over-populated area.A vast , sprawling game that does yield some rewards for die-hard fans , RE 3 is not a good way to introduce yourself to the series because of its unforgiving difficulty . The storyline may also confuse newcomers . If you 're a fan who does n't mind being confused and frustrated , then check it out . If not , wait for something better , like Code : Veronica , or anything in the Silent Hill series .	-1
Back in 1996 , Capcom introduced both Japanese and Americans gamers a brand-new world of videogaming . Despite the rather awkward name of & quot ; Resident Evil & quot ; , which is just plain out laughable , the title has become a household name . This movie-like , horror series can be written down as a new genre of gaming , horror . Yeah , very few games caused gamers to devastatingly sob ( Aeries ' funeral in Final Fantasy VII ) , some games built mystery or suspense ( Gray Fox 's desperate attack and impressive dialogue in Metal Gear Solid ) , but Resident Evil led the player to leap in fright or frantically jitter . Capcom inserted blood-thirsty zombies as the adversary , and the player 's fear as the biggest opposition . In a sense , it is a movie . Useless to say , Resident Evil was among the titanic series that landed on the Sony PlayStation . The original game presented an amazing surface . However it suffered from terrible voice acting and a somewhat dull story . Capcom extremely went hard at work for their sequel . Powerful hype erupted when Resident Evil 2 was announced . Anxious gamers could n't wait to get their grubby paws on a copy . Resident Evil 2 altered the gaming industry . Other home console companies decided to cash in while the genre was sizzling hot . Konami cashed in with Silent Hill . Survival/Adventure games went mainstream . After RE2 respectfully lived , a third installment was introduced , this time hype was scarce . It came out too quickly and sources claimed the interface was going to be identical as the other two . Fearing the worst , the third installment seemed to be a horrible move for Capcom . And is . From the experience of the two Resident Evil games , the player may expect the & quot ; scare moments. & quot ; While playing on a big screen t.v. , with surround sound , the volume almost reverberating the room , and a sudden pack of grunting zombies crashing out a window , I felt no fear . Amateurs to the Resident Evil series may have a chill ride their spine , but original fans will expect each scare attempt . Though few changes have been added , RE3 fails to take a leap over the original Resident Evil 2 . In other words just imagine playing Resident Evil 2 but with more rooms and more puzzle solving . RE2 is the strongest and most remembered in the series . When catching a glimpse of RE3 , excitement was absent . RE3 seems it brought the entire series in shame . The story must take a new direction ! Like taking a role of an umbrella agent , or the T-Virus spreading somewhere else than Racoon City . Nemesis , a ferocious , mean , bazooka- equipped devil who hunts the player , proves to be a pathetic antagonist and challenge . The minigames granted after beating the game bring little life at the game 's abrupt end . The slogan , & quot ; if the Suspense does n't kill you , then something else will , & quot ; lives truly in the second game .	-1
This was one of the first games i remember playing on the Playstation . So i wanted to replay it and i was very frustrated . I never finished the game back then and it was a big pain finishing it this time around . a lot of backtracking and poor inventory setup . I still think its one of the few titles for the playstation that you should give a try . I ordered it used and it came on time and i had no problem with the CD during gameplay .	-1
I bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system . It 's graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play . But the chances are that it will now be a dying system . With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow . While more and more PSX2 get into peoples homes the same can not be said for the DC . There maybe 70+ games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease . A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become . Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line . The local video stores around me have dropped Dc . Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale . The DC section had been replaced with PSX2 games . Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX2 and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind . Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry . The current price is very very good . But it is consol taking it 's last breaths . Was the PSX2 heaps better . I do n't think so . Not from what I saw . I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours . But it 's day is gone . The future is the PSX2 . A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar console 's . Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the future .	-1
Finally , Sega releases a video game system that rises above mediocrity ! Sega is famous for all kinds of failed ( and embarrassing ) video game consoles they brought to the world , but this time they actually `` kind of '' got it right with the Dreamcast.Unfortunately , Sega made a gigantic mistake that almost immediately brought down any chance of the Dreamcast becoming a success . They chose to release the Dreamcast in late 1999 . Gaming fans vividly remember what happened to the Sega Saturn just a couple years before , and people were n't going to be fooled again . This was now or never for Sega . If the Dreamcast failed , Sega would be gone from the hardware market forever.The release date for the Dreamcast was getting closer and closer . It was in September of 1999 . People were still very happy with their Playstation One because 1999 was one of Sony 's highlights for spectacular and revolutionary gaming . That was n't the only thing going on . Sony fans were also anticipating the release of the Playstation 2 , which was guaranteed to become the dominant console thanks to the relentless power and popularity the Playstation One was responsible for . It was during this time Sony was far and away the most powerful company in the video game business . Sega saw trouble ahead but continued to move forward with the expected Dreamcast release date.Nintendo was also very much alive and in the big picture with the Gamecube . Nintendo was content on making sure their fans would NOT be disappointed with the Gamecube the way they were with the N64 . Nintendo fans are loyal . *Nothing* can knock out Nintendo . Nintendo recognized their mistake with the N64 and knew they could make it right again . They knew they could give the Playstation 2 a run for its money ( and looking back , Nintendo did just that ) .And so , the release date for the Dreamcast arrived . With Nintendo and Sony on top of their game , what would happen ? What would happen to Sega ? The Dreamcast would hit the market and ... nothing . No sound . No noise . So little was said about the Dreamcast on the release date that it was like Sega had died right then and there . An eerie silence for a company that gave the world Sonic the Hedgehog.The Dreamcast failed because there were already more than enough successful gaming consoles on the market in 1999 , and people did n't want the Dreamcast to interfere with the superior , soon-to-be-released Sony and Nintendo gaming systems . Sega also failed because of their long , frustrating history of ripping people off with unsatisfactory video game systems ( such as the Sega CD and Sega Saturn ) . Sega would fool people into thinking they had something extraordinary in the works ... only to end up not supporting it . They had trouble supporting the video game consoles they created and would often leave people with failed attempts and false hopes . Sega would always fall asleep on the job . This would happen time and time again , with Sega hoping the brain-dead masses would buy their average , incomplete gaming consoles . It 's like the people who worked for Sega would always say `` let 's start something and not finish it '' .When Sega failed YET AGAIN with the Saturn , people finally could n't TAKE anymore . Anyone who was still a Sega fan by that point pretty much lost all hope . Sega was now the enemy and they had to go . A gaming console needs a giant selection of games , and unfortunately Sega only understood that ONE TIME in their lackluster history ( with the Genesis ) . Every other console they released only had a few classics to choose from among a bunch of average games.In the case of the Dreamcast , Sega tried to support it but it was too late . Sony had defeated them . Sony had defeated BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast with the overpowering success of the Playstation One . Hard to believe but it 's true : the Playstation One knocked out BOTH the Saturn and the Dreamcast off the market , making both of those consoles nothing more than a disappointing memory for Sega fans.In 1999 , Sega knew they would n't be able to compete with the Playstation 2 , so they finally did the right thing in early 2001 by announcing that they would never again make another video game console . Sega was DONE . They admitted defeat . That , my friends , made milions and millions of people very happy . No more junk on the market . That announcement was the best thing that could have happened , and if you happened to glance outside that day you would have noticed the sun smiling down on everyone.That meant no more arrogant Sega promotion . I used to hate the way Sega would always promote their games by putting down Nintendo and Sony . Now I can laugh at it . Sega really thought they could trick people into buying their crappy games by constantly making fun of Nintendo and Sony . Did n't work . Nintendo and Sony fans are too smart and considerate for that immature nonsense . I bet everyone responsible for the Playstation 's creation were laughing in piles of money over the `` fly , play thing , fly '' commercial that Sega created in an attempt to make Sony look second-rate . Ha ! That ugly , gray-colored box destroyed both the Saturn and the Dreamcast , and I hope Sega fans never forget it.It 's almost 2007 and people are STILL talking about the Gamecube and Playstation 2 . Why ? Because they are successful video game consoles . People will look back and REMEMBER them as successful consoles . No one remembers that the Dreamcast tried to compete with them at one point . People forgot the Dreamcast even EXISTED when the year 2002 came around . Sega 's video game consoles immediately became dated and forgettable once companies stopped making games for them . If Sega had put less energy into putting down the competition and more energy into offering their customers *complete* and enjoyable gaming consoles , maybe they 'd still be around today . As it stands , they deserved to watch Nintendo and Sony destroy them . Nintendo and Sony did n't have to stoop to dirty tactics to win over fans and the world is now a better place.With the release of Nintendo 's new revolutionary Wii system coming to America this November , along with the Playstation 3 , we do n't have to laugh at Sega 's silly attempt to compete only to end up being the laughing stock of the world . Goodbye Sega .	-1
Sega finally got it right with the Dreamcast despite the Nintendo knock off controllers . This was Sega 's last effort in the console wars but we all know how that turned out . By Sega , makes so good games on Nintendo .	-1
I bought the dreamcast with high hopes.Mostly because of Street fighter and sonic games.The only good games are Sonic Adventure 2 and Dead or Alive 2.Sega has made systems that all have failed.Like the recent Saturn.For the first couple of days its good.Cons : Very LoudNot may places to rent gamesNot many gamesNot many demo disksPros : Good GraphicsEasy ControlsEasy to hook upEasy to hall aroundOverall the dreamcast stinks.If your looking for a system with fair graphics , lots of games , good games , easy control i 'd buy the playstation .	-1
Sega does not even deserve a one star . The only good games for Sega is Sonic te Hedgehog . Sega announced the are making a deal with Nintendo to send Sonic to Nintendo . Sega has decided to give up to the competition . Finally . They will now only make games . I am happy for that . I am a Nintendo Fan . Zelda and Mario and I will be glad to see Soninc coming to Nintendo . Dreamcast starting in February will drop ... . At the end of the year goodbye Sega . Now our only compettioor is that damn Playstation and the Xbox will compete . But Nintendo Rules	-1
i thought this would be a good console , i was very very dissapointed ! it has very few good games , and the graphics arent all that i expected from it , i sold my DC and now i am waiting for the x box .	-1
Let 's sum up what is great about Dreamcast : Sensational graphics ( equal to PS2 ) , great sound , good controller design and an excellent , although not outstanding , software line up.Now , what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low -- -- -- Sega Corporation ! ! ! If you have n't heard the announcement yet , Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console . This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low . I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn . Once the Saturn production was stopped , only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX ( the same programming API as Windows for the PC ) I was very excited , because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast . There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come ( Urban Chaos , Rainbow Six ) were bad.Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies . I believe that Sega owes it 's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform . My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years . My Dreamcast lasted six months . Goodbye Sega purchases forever .	-1
This controller has to be one of the worst out on the market . It has a horrible design , is made of cheap plastic , and to make matters worse , it 's also highly priced . Do n't even think about using it for games like Marvel Vs. Capcom , because even casual play will break this controller . If you 're serious about games , find an import controller made by another company . Do n't even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America , they are all just as bad , if not worse .	-1
You know , sitting behind a computer screen , I 'm glad no one can see the look of disappointment that appeared on my very face the minute I began playing Tekken 3 . I am incredibly disappointed that after reading so many positive reviews claiming Tekken 3 to not only be a significant improvement over the previous two Tekken games , but also tagged `` the ultimate tournament fighter '' that the actual game would turn out to be *so* underwhelming.Tekken 3 really surprised me . But do n't take that as a compliment . I went into Tekken 3 with hardly any experience with fighting games whatsoever . I took a break for 10 years with tournament fighters after all those lousy 2D Mortal Kombat games brought me to tears . Back then I figured `` okay , either I do n't like fighting games or maybe I just do n't like the Mortal Kombat series '' . This was when Mortal Kombat 2 and 3 were popular on the Super NES and Genesis.A lot can change with a human being in 10 years . We grow older , we decide we want to learn about life and wonder where we came from , and we develop an apprecation for the things we have and the people who are in our lives . To put it simply , we 're thankful to be alive and feel good . But in some situations , things can remain EXACTLY the same . All those extreme feelings of hatred returned to me immediately after only 5 minutes with Tekken 3 . It was the exact same feeling of hopelessness I encountered with the Mortal Kombat series.I really have no idea what went wrong . No , not with the game , I mean , what went wrong with ME . Seeing as how I love watching people fight and kick butt on TV shows and movies , I figured it was only natural that the fighting style in the world of video games would appeal to me . Appeal to me a LOT . That was my assumption . But apparently it STILL has n't happened . Tekken 3 was supposed to help me wash away all the bad memories of playing old Mortal Kombat games and give me a fresh start and hopefully help me develop an appreciation for the ever-popular genre of games known as `` tournament fighters '' . Nope . It 's really disappointing to me to find out that Tekken 3 is just as bad as the rest of the fighters I 've played , and basically the same thing but with improved graphics , for that matter . All fighting games feel the same to me . It does n't even matter if they are 2D or 3D fighters.Tekken 3 , despite all the positive reviews , does NOT appeal to me whatsoever . The fighting is really clunky , and it seems each fighter delivers very basic and boring moves to each other . It 's not interesting or inspiring at ALL to me . It 's boring to watch , and even more boring to play . Why is it so much fun when they fight this way in movies but *not* interesting when it 's time to do the same thing in a video game ? I have no idea . If you want to pull off the really impressive looking moves in Tekken 3 , you have to press a bunch of buttons on the controller in a really complicated way in order to complete a move that COULD have been made *much* easier with a very simple and quick sequence of buttons . Strong emphasis on the word `` simple '' . Many moves actually require you to press the Circle button , and then jump over to the Square button . How is someone supposed to easily master this ? Going from Circle to Square is NOT easy.You see , for each of the ten characters in the game , they have major power moves that are very important to master because these are the moves that are supposed to cause the most damage to an opponent . However , many of these moves are incredibly difficult and sophisticated to pull off , and this is a *really* bad thing because the company responsible for this game apparently does n't understand the importance of making a fighting game easy to master for everyone , of all ages . That way , young and old people alike can appreciate the Tekken style.It really bothers me how ALL of the developers who release fighting games assume the player is automatically completely aware how to play the game . They assume this *every single time* they release a fighting game . Developers assume everyone who plays these kind of games will be able to understand them instantly . We 're supposed to be gifted players when it comes to understanding how to successfully pull off any number of lengthy and devestating combos to our opponents . We 're supposed to have enough time to press really awkward button combinations on the Playstation controller during a fast-paced and intense fighting match . Not just combos either- regular moves too . We 're supposed to have enough patience to continue trying the same fight over and over as we die a million times and the frustration factor increases significantly , and we realize just how IMPOSSIBLE these kind of games are.Well , I have news for every developer out there : many of us have a really difficult time with games like this . Not everyone who plays fighting games should automatically be expected to be a skilled player . Not all of us hang out at local arcades wasting tons of quarters as we try and perfect our skills . Some of us are , you know , average `` normal '' gamers who just like to have fun . The developers of tournament fighters NEVER could understand this , and years later , they still ca n't understand what it 's like to have fun . We should n't have to be a genius to play a fighting game . Not all of us can press the EXACT moves at the EXACT moment and win fights . Maybe one day a tournament fighter will be invented for a gaming console that will be specifically designed to be playable for people who struggle with them . Maybe one day ... Other things I do n't like about Tekken 3 . Despite having excellent graphics , the music is a bunch of horrible , repetitive techno sounds that hardly make me feel compelled to continue playing the game . Oh , and by the way , even though the graphics are really a notch above the rest , there 's absolutely no reason to jump with joy when looking at them . Since the fighting is just as basic and uninspiring as that of , oh I do n't know , Killer Instinct ( another terrible game ) you quickly stop caring about how the game looks . In fact , I 'd say the fighting engine is EXACTLY like that old Super Nintendo game Killer Instinct . Extremely uninteresting . When someone throws a punch , it 's so boring to watch that you just do n't care about it . That 's what Tekken 3 is all about . Having a fighting engine that 's so boring you do n't even care if you win or lose.I 'm disappointed . That 's the only thing I can say at the moment . Maybe one day an easy tournament fighter will hit the market where the main purpose of the game is to have the computer opponents move along at a reasonable pace for all the normal people out there who constantly struggle with fighting games . A game that will give people the much needed time and patience to put a move on their opponent . A game where you are n't expected to hurry up just to deliver a simple move . Somehow , despite hundreds of tournament fighters that will eventually hit stores , I doubt this will ever happen . I will never buy another tournament fighter again . Ever .	-1
If you want a basic hack and slash dungeon game , where the puzzles do n't require much thought , then this game is for you . If , however , you 're looking for a game with character development and a good story line with intricate details and subplots , then you probably wo n't enjoy this game very much . I 've played all of the Might and Magic games , except for the first two , and even the earlier M & amp ; M games were better than this.The quests and storyline are very cliche ' . Most of the skills you can train in are n't very useful . I have a fighter with 7th level repair and she still ca n't repair anything without breaking it . Trade and armsmaster are probably the most useful skills , as well as learning , which helps you level faster . One plus is that when you level , you can up your stats even if you ca n't afford to train.A huge improvement would be if we could edit our own levels and quests , but the game does n't even include that.The 3D-graphics are n't too bad , once you get over the hilarious way the characters look ( imagine a Barbie or Ken doll crossed with Japanese animation , and you 'll get the idea . ) Another plus is the hack and slash portions of the game are addictive . If only the plot was better .	-1
I 've played a lot of games in the past few years , and Dark Stone has to be one of the most boring games in the world . When it was new it did have it 's halfway decent ( although a little too cartoonish ) graphics . But now that the game is a few years old , it can not even claim that.A bad attempt at a slightly more complicated Diablo , this game just does n't cut it .	-1
I do n't mind if the graphics are n't completely state of the art , but this was ridiculous . Not only were the graphics terrible , but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible . I ran this game on a P3-733Mhz with a DDR GeFORCE256 video card and could not enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you would receive depending upon where in the track you were . Terrible . Even at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish . I-76 , which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS4 . I am unbelievably dissapointed .	-1
To be quite honest , I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I 've ever played . The narrative sequences are ridiculously long , the graphics are mediocre , and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed . I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it , and I was terribly disappointed .	-1
I really love platform games . I guess it is because I love to explore and make my way through those cool-looking worlds . And I have to tell you , Sonic Adventure 's worlds look great . This was the very first 128 bit game I had played and boy , was I excited . The game really disappointed and annoyed me however.After playing through the game a bit , you will start to realize that after the fun action stages , you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cut-scenes ( that you ca n't skip ) that will drive you mad . Most of them involve sonic and Robotnik threatening each other , or just characters talking . Also , the characters will pause between almost every sentence . It takes forever for them to finish what they are saying , and you wo n't really care most of the time . Boring . If you make it through the cut-scenes , then you wander through the adventure stages , looking for the next action stage . Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like & quot ; Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet ? & quot ; When you find another action stage , things will get a bit better , but only for a while . Some of the cool things you can do are snowboard , speed through a futuristic highway . Cool . But , then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices ( especially tails . ) If you are a real platfor fan , skip this one and get Rayman 2 . It may not be super-fast , but it sure is n't boring . And it has better worlds and graphics .	-1
Sonic Adventure is a game that tries to do way too much . There are six characters and only one ( sonic ) is decent . Most of the game is boring and the rest is usually to broken to be any fun.The Sonic level 's , which should have been the entire game , are plagued with a broken camera ( it was on crack , sometimes it would focus inside a wall ) and bugs . The boss battles are way to easy , and when you started to pick up speed I felt like the game was playing itself ( I tried to fail on the whale level and it was impossible ) . Plus the sonic story is super short . I did n't really like the other game stories.In the Tails levels you just replay the same levels as sonic but you can fly . The camera and bugs are even worse here.The E-102 Gamma levels are a super generic shoot-em up game.In Knuckles level 's you search for gems in a map and is very tiresome.In Amy 's level you pretty much just walk around and hit enemies with a hammer , it gets old very fast.I save the worst for last Big the cat . His levels are just a fishing mini-game . There 's nothing special at all , just a boring fishing game , way to go sonic team.Most of Sonic adventure you play boring sub characters , and when you do get to play as sonic , it 's too short and plagued with too bug to be any fun . This is by far the most overpraised Dreamcast game out there .	-1
With all the great reviews , I thought I would give it a try . Yeah , it 's dated , but I expected that . Some dated games are fun ... I just did n't think this was one of them . I played it for about 5 hours on `` normal '' , which was enough time to learn the controls and understand the game play . The map is difficult to read/understand . The psychic abilities are okay , but switching to them takes a little time ... enough time for the zombies or monkeys to kill you . I found the interface a bit clunky . I just could n't get excited about this game or the story/narration . I thought it was tedious , not fun.I was able to get this working on Windows XP Home SP3 , but it took a little effort.If you need help , go to youtube and search for this video : hHg1cXfTUBcHe does a good job of explaining how to do it.Here it is in a nutshell : install the gamefind , download , and install SystemShock2_patch.exein the installation folder , rename sshock2.exe to sshock2.oldfind and download SystemShock2_xp_2000_fix.zipcopy the exe from the above zip file to the installation folderin the installation folderopen shock.cfg with notepadat the end of that file , on a separate line , add this : safe_texture_managersave and exit the fileWindows XP boot.ini changes ( BE CAREFUL ! ) go to control panel , system , advanced , startup and recovery , settingsclick editadd the following line under the [ operating system ] section : multi ( 0 ) disk ( 0 ) rdisk ( 0 ) partition ( 1 ) \WINDOWS= '' Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game '' /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /numproc=1save the boot.ini filerebootwhen prompted , select the `` Microsoft Windows XP - System Shock 2 Game '' optionWindows boots like usualplay the gameAfter you play the game through to its ending , be sure to remove the `` numproc=1 '' line that you added to boot.ini.Visit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections	-1
I 've always been a Thief fan , especially Thief 1 . I 'd read about this game over the years , but never played it because I was busy playing other games . This game was developed by the same folks who made Thief , so I figured it had to be great.I rate it with one star because I can not install it on an SD card and play it on my netbook which lacks a CD drive . Even after doing a full install , the game refuses to start without a disk in the non-existant drive . This is inexcusable because I *paid* for this game , while those who obtain it through other means are able to do the above.Once again , I ( the honest customer ) get shafted . I regret buying this game and I will never ever touch another EA-published product again . Thanks guys ! To all the gamers , ask yourself this question : How will you play all of these games that require a CD in the drive to run when modern computers eventually stop using optical media ? Oh , but I forgot , nobody is supposed to be playing games from a decade ago . We 're all supposed to get the shiny title of the month !	-1
Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying . I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous . Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding , regenerating zombies . You aint got ta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I would n't be bothered . If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time . But I sure would n't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon .	-1
This game was bought and rather farfetched . I hoped it would work and It does n't play story mode at all . So I 'm stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session . A shame .	-1
Do n't pay a penny for this , folks . Move on to an EA game . There is very little in the way of actual physics calculations between players in this game , every interaction is merely a scripted animation . RBs are stopped in full stride by shoestring tackles . WRs run their routes at half speed while the DBs shadow them *IN FRONT* of their routes . Offensive line programming is horrible . Guards and tackles blow assignments on EVERY play , doubling up on a DT and allowing LBs to come free and tackle the RB at the handoff . There is no player momentum , a flaw I 've noticed in a number of Sega Sports games , meaning any player can stop in mid-stride and immediately run full stride in the opposite direction . Sit back and watch the computer play : 3and out , 3 and out , 3 and out ... This was an incomplete game that should not have been released . So what if it looks pretty ? It plays like crap .	-1
I was very disappointed in this PC game . It was boring . Everything about the game was chance . You have little control over what happens . Game time is short and it is very likely you did not win anyway . It was a waste of my time . If you really think you need this game - buy it used or at least a new one cheap .	-1
Costing as much as fifty dollars new at the time , I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in 1999 or so when I played my N64 a lot.The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break . The first stupid thing it does is in its use , you put the Gameshark into the slot , then stick the game up on top of it . As with many cartridge game systems , it seems you need to wiggle it about , and position it just right just for it to work . I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gameshark 's life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lop-sided , because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way , like it 's supposed to.Of all the functions it has , half of them do n't even work . The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games , and at worst , caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark . I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code , and ended up filling up my entire Gameshark 's memory with useless information . Almost none of the pre-set games and codes worked , names were screwed up with random characters and letters , and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game.The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious joke -- -both VHS 's had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT ! If you still remember how VHS 's work , this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT ! I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS , packaged it with the Gameshark , sent it back for a refund , and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else ! Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run . It does n't ruin your game permanently , but it ruins itself just fine . There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped working .	-1
A fun shoot 'm up , no less , and regrettably , no more . Fans of the board game , the series , or even the role- playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment . The game has few options besides & quot ; click and shoot & quot ; . Still , I spent a fun few hrs playing it ( and a lotta dlrs buying it ) .I hope we 'll get a better , more extensive version soon .	-1
This controller is an okay replacement for the original SNES controllers , but not as good . The reason why this controller is not as good as the original SNES controllers is because the buttons are not as sensitive to button presses unlike the original which have very sensitive buttons ; the buttons after using them for several months or a little bit more start to sink down more inside the controller because the springs are not as strong as the ones in the original controllers are . In addition , they are made cheaper than the original controllers and are not as durable , so they will not last as long . My recommendation is to not buy these controllers and get refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers on ( ... ) or the exact replica version because they use the same exact materials to make those controllers as Nintendo does for their controllers . The only difference is the exact replica 's do not have the Nintendo logo on it . I got two refurbished original Super Nintendo controllers from that website and they work excellently and they will last for many years . And another thing about the New Port controllers , the first time you use them , the D-Pad buttons are rather stiff and eventually lossen up after using them for a while and become easier to use . A last warning about the controller , the down function on the D-Pad does not work very good , unlike on the original Super Nintendo cotrollers , the down function on the D-Pad works excellently .	-1
I know what you 're thinking ... I need another controller . The generic ca n't be that bad , I might not like it , but I 'll be able to play.No , you will not . You wll hate every minute of this.As others have said , the buttons are actually ok , but the d-pad will drive you insane . Rage quit-inducing . Do n't bother , go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual , old SNES controller . The price will be well worth it . I 've pretty much thrown this in the garbage , but I ca n't seem to bring myself to it for some reason , but it deserves it .	-1
With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation controllers ( but minus the analog sticks of the & quot ; Dual Shock & quot ; controller ) , this controller 's obvious benefit is to owners of & quot ; Connectix Virtual Game Station & quot ; , the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh emulator . It 's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME , the emulator of classic arcade video games.The one place Gravis makes a change is very much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by a single pivoting directional-pad . As too often happens with designs like this , the D-pad pushes two switches at once , and ALWAYS comes through as a diagonal ( eg , right + up , when you thought you were just pushing right ) . The frequent inability to enter a true right , left , up , or down is annoying in some games , particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG , and deadly in others ( PSX & quot ; Asteroids & quot ; is unplayable when rotating your ship sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace , since that 's what & quot ; up & quot ; does ) .Also of note is the fact that this controller works only with games written to use Apple 's & quot ; InputSprockets & quot ; . That 's true of most late 90 's / early 2000 's games , but not of some earlier titles ( & quot ; Descent & quot ; , which used to be bundled with Mac Performas , comes to mind ) , and it 's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming Mac OS X.That said , driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free on my two iMacs and my iBook . USB plug-and-play almost always works without a snap , though I 've found it 's better to plug it in once the Finder is up instead of during the boot cycle.If you play lots of Mac games ( and by the way ... HOW ? ! ) , this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard alone , but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation .	-1
This will get the job done on most games , however if you want to play games like Street Fighter or any other game that requires directional based special moves , you can forget it.Software on the site allows you to program special move buttons.The buttons are terrible . They 'mush ' down . They are not springy as they should be .	-1
On the face of things , & quot ; X-Wing Alliance & quot ; has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the Star Wars franchise . The characters are engaging , with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material to start a small movie . Conveniently , there *is* actually a small movie which opens the game off with a real narrative bang . It makes one wish that Lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was making _The Phantom Menace_.Unfortunately , after this high point , the game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the plot -- painfully slowly . Oh , there are cool points along the way . The cut scenes are interesting , and the sound environment throughout the missions is superb . But the in-play graphics engine is fairly ordinary by LucasArts ' own standards . The missions themselves are endless variations on the same themes . And the game 's conclusion is less than satisfactory.But there 's another side to the game -- multiplayer action -- and for this the game deserves some praise . As a vehicle for capturing the gaming possibilities of the Net , & quot ; X-wing & quot ; is worth the purchase price . There 's a large , loyal player base for the whole & quot ; X-wing & quot ; series , so you 'll never be alone on the Net.Still , there are better options to get what you want out of a Star Wars game . & quot ; Rogue Squadron & quot ; is an infinitely better single-player space game . And the upcoming & quot ; Force Commander & quot ; promises to be something of a new standard in multiplayer action . By comparison , & quot ; X-wing Alliance & quot ; merely feels like a solid update to an aging series .	-1
This is a very dissapointing system . Slow loading , Bad graphics , and terrible games . But it has a good controller .	-1
As usual Interact accessories dissapoint . This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks . The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you hand ... .not good at all . Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance ! AVOID AT ALL COST . Get the official Sega Jump pak instead	-1
This thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play . It is at times comical . It makes your controller rattle , you hear shaking noises , and feel like you are having some sort of seizure.This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion . It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES . Remember him ? Neither does anybody else ... It is an interesting idea , but it does n't really enhance the games . Just because the controller shakes in your hands does n't mean you feel like part of the game . In fact , with all the shaking , it might even disrupt your game play . You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot , at least that enhances your gaming experience . I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and have n't used it since . Do n't waste your money on it . That is the best advice I can give .	-1
Sure it was fun for the first hour then it died . I could never get the kids to stop vandalism . Riding the rollercoasters were n't fun at all . You want a theme park game get Rollercoaster tycoon . Rollercoaster tycoon not Rollercoaster tycoon 2 , but I wo n't get into that . Where can I get a refund ... . ?	-1
I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital , RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World ( as its called in the UK ) would go one step further.Basically this is a kiddies game . Its NOTHING like Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do . There are fun rides and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you dont have the same amount of control as in RCT.Its nice to look at ( although I did n't like the 3D style ) and you need a good spec machine otherwise expect jerkovision ( or if you build too many rides ) . Theres only 4 parks/scenarios ! unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack ) . My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has taken a whole new view point into Sim games . This is n't a true Sim game - I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a Sim game . Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT . It also loses marks for having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the MS-Office Paperclip one ! ( Luckily you can turn him off ! ) I stopped playing it after a week . So will true Sim Fans . Bring on another RCT add on pack !	-1
Sim ThemePark was not what I saw coming . Right when I got it , I popped it into the CD-Rom on the computer . I was so excited ! But then , the downside comes along . The installation takes forever . I had to try again to make it work . Then , it takes forever just to get into the game . And when I finally got into the game , the colors were all screwed up . Okay , so I messed with some hardware on the computer , but even after my mom fixed it , they still would n't work right ! ! And whenever I go into the game , it gets stuck right after I click & quot ; quit & quot ; . So I have to restart the computer completely . Since the day I first got this , this game has not seen the CD-Rom . At all . I am looking into Roller Coaster Tycoon , and am hoping that it will work much better than this . Thank you for reading my review !	-1
I thought this game looked like it would be great -- but it turned out that it was boring , irritating , not to mention that it has bugs- my computer is almost brand new , and this game would crash every five minutes . A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon , and I became addicted to it- I LOVE it ! If you are interested in this game , I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead , it 's a lot more fun , and it does n't have bugs- do n't waste your money on Sim ThemePark !	-1
This is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the 2nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it do n't waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but i 've never been able to use it since its so messed up	-1
I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment . I probably would have liked it more if I had n't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon ( even though I 'm not really a fan of that game , it 's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park ) . I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from , which made this a very short lasting game . Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides ! Talk about cheap.Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars , I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon . Actually , this game is pretty good for all ages , it 's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids , about I guess 6-12 . If you want a game for older gamers , try Rollercoaster Tycoon . ( I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting ) .	-1
Well there 's a lot of ways this game could have been fun , IF only they had tried to put more into it , ok it says on the front box that you can chose from 4 different types of parks , In reality all the parks are the same , just different animation , they all have a feris wheel , flying bird thing , ect ... The little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely inoying , and yet they make it so that you HAVE to have him to play the game , other wise you 'll not be able to get to problems in time . I mean are programers IDIOTS ? Do they think that a little cannonball making bad jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we really want to have as an advisor ? And why do they animate the kids and everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking ? In almost every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as possible , why ? Its not funny , it demotes the animators intelegence . Anyways the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own roller coasters , and you can turn the little cannonball guy off ! Although it will be harder to manage without him .	-1
first in the series by blizzard . not something I would play nowadays but this was a very interesting rpg back in the day when I had been a gamer .	-1
Hope you like backtracking cause you 'll be doing that allot in this one . I bought this game at a yard sale for a buck $ and I still think I got ripped off . This game has no strategy , none . The controls suck , whatever happened to up , down , left , right ? Guess the developers at Blizard entertainment thought that is just way to convenient . I have no clue on how this game got so many good reviews over the years . This game is for anyone under the age of 14 to like it . You ca n't just fight a boss head on , ( like they do in games that were actually worth playing ) , no you have to run behind a door or somethin ' and cast a spell until he 's dead . ... Yeah , I know , as if a boss does n't know on how to open a freakin ' door . Another thing that got me was when your backtracking outside some kid just outside of this underground church that goes ten stories down . The kid has some info on a place or a location or somethin ' , he charges outrageous prices , like if you want a sword or somethin ' , it 's $ 4689 . WTF ! Ya know a nickle use to go a long way in the 1920 's , this is like 1400 's , Whats he fixin ' to buy , a castle ? I do n't what my dollar back , I want the 8 hours I wasted my life on playing it . So do n't buy this game , no matter how little of a price they want it .	-1
I REALLY DID NOT LIKE THIS GAME AT ALL ! IT WAS WAY TOO FANTASY-BASED ! DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF YOU LIKE GAMES THAT ARE EVEN SLIGHTLY REALISTIC !	-1
In the exact sense of the word , the game cheated me . The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date . What 's the problem ? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the innovation and tie it onto the & quot ; and all was well & quot ; ending.The graphics are amazing , although there is way too much green , and you spent less time in original-looking levels than in the & quot ; normal & quot ; ones . Nevertheless , from the beginning , they look quite surreal and amazingly life-like . More than that - they are aesthetic . The main character is pretty much non-existent , snce he has no lines , and his only role in the game is to capture monsters . The battle engine offers far too few choices , since upgrading your character 's equipment is nonsense ( he rarely enters actual combat ) , and you ca n't equip your monsters . Therefore , the game 's central and only concept is to go through level after level , capturing and merging monsters . There 's nothing more to the game . Oh , yes , there are several original parts ( you earn money by selling the captured monsters ) , but they are too few .	-1
Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played . Sure , terran marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are frustrating . You have to right click ( why not the usual left-click ? ) to select units and you cant deselect them . Building times are extremely long- and so are the units . Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow ( on a Pentium II 400 , voodoo3 , 96mb RAM ) . I have only got up to the third terran mission then finally gave up . And whats up by only controlling 12 units at a time ? The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on screen.Starcraft 's ingame graphics are n't that good , FMV qualty is terrible and Battle.net gives you a pain in the a** because of its slow server and few options . Westwood online gives the player more options and is also faster . All in all , i say the command and conquer series is better - go play tiberian sun or red alert or any other C & amp ; C game - SC isnt worth your time or money .	-1
{ YAWN } Very boring disapointing game . Terrible gameplay , graphics , bla bla bla . The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate . At least the music is kinda good . I do n't recommend this for any god damn gamer . = [ ...	-1
I recieved this older game quickly . But I was still playing the new Tomb Raider on PS3 and did not install it on y PC for a couple of weeks . I could not get this agme to work properly on my new computer . It loaded fine and background music worked but the graphics were .. hmm .. stone age looking . No matter how I tried to reconfigure my graphic card it would not adjust to be playable graphics . I deleted it from my computer . I gave it to my son to try and load on his slightly older system , but he has n't tried to play yet because he is playing his new games . I will update and post what he says about his experience with it .	-1
The game will not load on my Mac . The box says its supposed to . This was a very big disappointment . I was trying to get out of the shooter games .	-1
Hey , maybe I 'm doing something wrong but , I have n't been able to get this game to do much of anything ... the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse ... I did n't play very long though , so it 's not fair to say it truly [ stinks ] ... Maybe I 'll try it again and see if I missed something ...	-1
Even when this game first came out , it was fairly mediocre . Let 's move on , shall we ? There are many , many games that topple Half Life and Counter Strike released since 1998.Contrary to what the Amazon editorial had to say about this game , Half Life is not the bloodiest ( Soldier of Fortune ) , is not the smartest ( No One Lives Forever ) , and is not the scariest ( System Shock 2 or Clive Barker 's Undying ) .Half Life is a hypefest .	-1
I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games ( `` Sins of the Father '' and `` The Beast Within '' ) . They were creepy , well-researched , and had great atmosphere.Well , `` Blood of the Sacred , Blood of the Damned '' had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires ! Neat ! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.To give you an example of what I mean , one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another . A perfectly good motor scooter ( I think ; it 's been a while ) is available . But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy . He has to have a big motorcycle . So that 's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride.Let me get this straight . He 's a detective trying to solve a case , but he 's going to waste time finding a cooler ride ? That was the point where I threw the game out the window , so I ca n't comment on how it ends , unfortunately . The voice acting was pretty lame ; I do n't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent , but he can't.Now that [ the price has dropped ] , it 's worth trying if you 're really into Gabriel Knight . Otherwise , there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap . Try one of them .	-1
On paper Hellfire seems like a great idea . Take a really good game , add a couple additional levels , quests , items and monsters , put in a couple of new classes , and bam : instant winner.Sadly that does n't pan out in practice . Part of it is that the Hellfire design feels largely uninspired and lacks the cohesiveness , balance and ingenuity that went into original Diablo . In fact there are only two really good features in Hellfire . The first is the `` Jog '' toggle that allows your character to run in Tristram . Too bad it does n't function in the dungeons . The second is the `` Search '' spell that helps you locate items on the ground . Unfortunately it 's a spell , so you have to spend mana on it . Blizzard rolled up both these features in Diablo II in much improved form . As it stands they end up not benefiting Diablo very much.The rest of the additions are just mediocre or worse . The new character class is fun , but kinda unbalanced , and does n't really add a lot of depth . Lots of stuff feels tacked on and has an inconsistent art style that does n't match Diablo 's polish . There are n't really a lot of new quests . One ( of the two ) new area is downright annoying . Some of the best features can only be enabled by editing a special file outside the game.The worst part of Hellfire is that playing it means making a tradeoff . It is not a seamless expansion to Diablo - it 's almost like a separate game . Your Diablo characters are n't portable between Hellfire and the original game , so you have to roll new ones . And while Diablo went on to gain five more patches after Hellfire 's release - Sierra only patched their game once ... so Hellfire players have to contend with bugs long-fixed in Diablo . In addition to those bugs , Hellfire brings a set of its own , which never got resolved . Hellfire players ca n't ( without hacking the game ) play multiplayer . This expansion is not playable on Battle.net . The music in new areas is lacking , and because it is n't read from the CD , the game glitches whenever an item is picked up . The drop system is bugged out the wazoo , to where finding some of the new unique items is actually impossible.I would really recommend this one only to die-hard Diablo fans . Those without it are not missing out on anything . Sierra tried to pull it off but they just could n't match that Blizzard standard set by the original game , and the new features are n't worth fighting the bugs and irritants brought on by this expansion .	-1
The expansion was outsourced to Sierra Online and the quality from Diablo I was not maintained.The expansion does not really add anything : monsters seem out of touch , music , ending are nothing compared to the original . Skip this and go straight from Diablo to Diablo II which is another pure marvel .	-1
This is a joke of a game . Let 's see , a campaign can be finished in an hour . The AI makes you conclude that enemy fighter pilots have a deep vindictive nature ( is mine the only plane in the sky ? ) . All in all , this game is like a new level of computer chess -- boring as hell , and yet somehow intelligently scripted [ SCRIPTED ] !	-1
If a game does n't hook me within the first half-hour then I 'm just not going to see it through to the end . Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires : In Space to me and the slow , confusing gameplay really got on my nerves . I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments , but I simply could not get into it.Usually , I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it . I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go . Call me shallow , but it did n't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes .	-1
Well , I must say that I was really disappointed by this game ! I got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable . Having played for interminable hours with the original Civilization game I had great expectations from this title . In the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels ever ! The MAYOR SHORTFALLS ARE : 1- Game speed . By the time you reach the space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world , and will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age . Since the speed is so fast , by the time you have an army of , let 's say musketeers , you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb . THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING ! 2- Units : Fewer than its predecessors and less realistic . 3- The space age : It is only confusing and does n't really help to make the game interesting . 4- Unconventional units : You have now lawyers and eco-warriors that work something like the spies in the original game . In the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing ! It would have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the game and add a few varibles afterwards ( i.e . : political movements and private enterprise ) . 5- Customization : It is now impossible to customize the game , like create new units as it was possible in CIV 2 . I hate that ! 6- Maps : Lacks a map of earth ! It used to be the only map I played on in CIV 2 ! IMPROVEMENTS 1- Graphics : Way better than the predecessors . Too bad that the other features in the game did n't get quite to the same level ! 2- Soundtrack : Improved somehow . 3- Combat : A tactical display now allows you to actually play battles . Nice idea to start with , but it is somehow badly put to work and has some incredible bugs ( like archers that shoot down stealth bombers ! ) .My suggestion ? Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2 !	-1
Why did n't I just read the packaging and put it down . No , I had to go and buy it . I played Civ II once , Alpha Centauri two or three times , and now Call to Power ... well , I did n't make it through the tutorial.One word ... ZZZZZZZZZZZ !	-1
This game calls its civilizations & quot ; races & quot ; and has slavery as a prominet part of the game , but there is the abolition eventually . It does not feel like a successor to Civilization II . The wonders of the world are all new , as is the technology tree . The interface is new , and you can not use a keyboard to move units . I did not care much for its supposedly improved graphics over Civilization II , I did not see that much improvement , and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anyway.There are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them . The cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere , converting cities and eating into your empire 's resources . The lawyer hides just as you are about to move a military unit to kill him . Building cities in space and under water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two original Civilizations . But playing at lower levels , this wo n't be interesting , becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction ; at higher levels , the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and characters to persevere with marine and space existence . The only real improvement over Civilization II is that governments are more stable during war . In Civ II , if you wanted to wage a serious war , you had to install monarchy or fundamentalism , or your government would collapse . Bottom line : maybe it 's because I am older , but I did not enjoy this game as much as Civilization II . What comes out of & quot ; Call to Power & quot ; screams for help to bring more original and well-crafted games to the market .	-1
Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software , but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play . In AC the Believers will appear on your borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace again . Forget about the fun of managing a nation : this is a non-stop Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water . ( Some players might like this , but I find it tedious . ) There 's no point in trying to negotiate with other factions because they 'll just turn right around and violate your territory or declare war . Then after you have spent decades trying to build up your industry , when your output reaches a certain level the planet itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms . *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the planet itself defeats you , and there 's not much sense of satisfaction in that . Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly . You will spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you will playing . I really wanted to like this game , but after a while its defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome . Let 's hope that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and challenging than beating one .	-1
Awful ! A real disapointment . This game is confusing and boring much like civilization 2 . The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was . I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then . I was sooo dissapointed . It takes forever to play , the battles are cheesy and a waste of time . If you are considering buying this game , I reccomend you try it before you buy it . Belive me it 's not even worth $ 5 . I 've always been dissapointed with Sid Meier 's games . So I think I 'll stop trying them . If your considering this game , try Imperium Galactica 2 . It 's awsome . No comparison . I hope you found this reveiw helpful .	-1
I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel . It 's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes , but what 's worse is that you would n't want to ! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game . Where are all the catchy tunes ? I ca n't remember one line from this game , whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper 's songs memorized . It 's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite : & quot ; Sunny in my life , she 's like a dice , I ca n't tell which way to turn 'till I spice ! & quot ; Skip UmJammer and get Parappa .	-1
I would rent this game . It takes no skills what so ever to beat it . Maybe it just came naturally to me , or maybe I 'm just to critical but this game is not worth buying . In my opinion this game would only appeal the the 8-11 age range and even then would they only play it once or twice .	-1
I have most of the major flight sims and now I have this and have only worked with it a bit but I find it a little too overcomplicated , it 's taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat tested.The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I 've ever seen , the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead.If you are really a B17 nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then you 'll like the sim .	-1
It does n't make any sense . How can this game be considered a classic ? It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it `` best game of all-time '' or `` best Castlevania game you 'll ever play '' .I do n't think so . If you want a `` real '' Castlevania game , go play Castlevania 64 for the N64 . That 's how a Castlevania game should be done . Not like Symphony Of The Night , which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems.Do n't believe me ? You will soon enough . First and foremost , Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb . You see , the game begins with you playing as Richter , and you 're back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula . This is ridiculous . I do n't want to play THAT game , I want to play Symphony Of The Night . You do n't have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros. 3 . So you should n't have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game . What the hell is wrong with Konami ? This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.After that 's over , the REAL game begins , but unfortunately that 's not true . It does n't begin yet . Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle ( which you unfortunately have no control over ) . Once he 's inside and the gate closes , you can now play as him , but wait a minute . There 's no music playing in the background . A game ca n't really start if there 's no music , because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.Luckily , my worst fear did n't come true ( that Konami forgot to put music in the game ) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in . It 's about time ! You had me worried there ! But then more problems arise . In the same little area where the music kicks in , you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you , and many times you never see these zombies coming until it 's too late and you take a hit . Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria . She 's extremely attractive , and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons . And that 's a big problem . The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it 's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest . After a Maria encounter , you ca n't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face , those big beautiful eyes , that smooth relaxing voice , and so then what happens after that is , when you are in the middle of a serious battle , you almost always die because you ca n't stop thinking about Maria 's beautiful face.Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games . I should n't have to say it , but I think it 's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman , because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere . They should n't have made her look so pretty . Because of this , only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure . Had she been less attractive , guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.You 're probably thinking by now `` Alright , talk about the actual GAME ! '' Okay , I will , but you wo n't like what I have to say . It 's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic . Basically , it all boils down to one thing . The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow , weak and almost useless . Yes , I 'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador . Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game . But because they did , we have no choice but to put up with them , and I have no choice but to complain . These two weapons really drag the game down.I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game . Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you , which if you ask me , lacks creativity . Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight , but no , they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them , forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen . Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence , we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse , we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we 're not careful . A little bit of blood is fine , but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful . It 's enough to terrorize you . So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you wo n't have to attack them , though in many places , avoiding enemies wo n't be easy.Finally , the biggest problem . The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down , so it 's not really a new castle . Now that 's what I call clumsy . Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place , it feels like I 'm watching a porno blood fest . Not a pretty thought , is it ? So as you can see , many problems prevent this game from being a classic . Do n't even think about buying it .	-1
WTF is this crap , this is metroid not castlevainia ... ... this sucks . PS stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hair .	-1
This game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring . It may have been a great game six years ago , but by today 's standards this one is a definite loser . Save your money .	-1
I grew up playing this game as a kid , so after buying this game in this day and age I really tried hard to like it . I really did , but I just couldn't.I remember playing this on DOS with the joystick . The graphics are a little better then I remembered it and the playstation control is a lot easier to handle than a joystick . The level design is also very retro and original . You simply do n't get such dark , dysptopianish , techno inspired level design like this anymore . Speaking of techno , the soundtrack allthough very short is simply the best soundtrack of the entire Wipeout franchise . Messhja being the best song in my opinion.Now where this game sadly suffers is the gameplay.Anti-Grav racing has gotten faster as time moves on and as a result the original Wipeout simply has n't aged that well . You simply move too slow in this game . So slow that your thumb will actually start to feel sore after two races . I ca n't even play this game with the X button as the thrust anymore . I have to use the Triangle button , but that is not even the worst aspect of this game . The worst is that fact that your ship loses all of its speed every single time you miss a turn or bump into an enemy ship and that 's another problem . Nothing is more annoying in this game then having to pass another ship and have that ship bump into you slowing you down . A more minor issue I have with this game is all the weapon effects just look boring and uninspired looking . If I 'm shooting rockets or missles I want to see a lot more than just a small cloud of dust . I want to see some sorta projectile and explosion.Overall I only recemend playing this game if you never experienced the later Wipeouts especially Wipeout Fusion . Once you play Fusion this game becomes pretty much unplayable .	-1
i saw the TV comercial for this game and it looked pretty cool but when i got it for christmas it got very boring i mean all u do is try to get to the other end of the level with ur ball and collect cards so there is n't much to this game i would n't reccomend this game 2 many people	-1
Ok so i get the idea that you are a glove rolling on a ball . Hmmmm . Ok well here goes . If you liked this game , you are an IDIOT ! HELLO GUYS YOU ARE A GLOVE ! WHAT THE HECK IVE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH AN IDIOTIC CHARACTER ! A GLOVE ! FOR GOODNESS SAKES , IVE HEARD THAT ORIGINALITY IS GOOD , BUT THIS ? ok i will stop yelling . But jeeze guys cant you see that only some kind of fool would actually enjoy playing as a glove that can balance on a ball ? Well I can . So I 'm out , enough said .	-1
This game can be described in a few simple words , boring , repeaditive , bad , pointless .	-1
Well , it wo n't work at all . I put it in my console , and nothing . I looked it over carefully to make sure I did n't buy some ... knock off , but it even has etched trademarks , ext . It does n't recognize the disk at all . So I went to the Activision site to see if I could find some help on this game . And this is what they said ... ProblemDoes not load and play.SolutionActivision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its Dreamcast title Blue Stinger . The manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores , but will result in start-up failure on certain Dreamcast systems.If you experience this problem , we encourage you to call 1-888-402-8951 and The Blue Stinger Hotline will send you a new disc free of charge .

We would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience , but are confident that once this problem is corrected , you will have an outstanding gaming experience with Blue Stinger and the Dreamcast hardware.So , I just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem , or will have this problem in the future . So far I have only got their answering machine . Let 's see if they are still supporting this title and call me back : o ) CraigUPDATE : Talked to someone from Activision . He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there : o ) Guess it 's been awhile since it was out . Anyway , they replaced it as promised . But , the games really [ stinks ] ! ! ! Do n't bother . It 's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up , so I do n't remember what it was that I did n't like about the game . But , I do remember that I knew this was a really bad game in about ten minutes of playing it . Was n't even worth my time getting it replaced .	-1
I have played few games that were as funny as this one . Why ? Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games , get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue , music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams , game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you 've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands . This game does n't do Sega any justice and do n't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game , they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game , Deep Fear , was art compared to this . I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models , inconsistent soundtrack , awkward dialogue , non-existent atmosphere , incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I 've ever played on a DreamCast game . Your characters run so slow you 'd think they had weights tied to their ankles , but their steps look so played out it 's almost like they 're waddling away from danger ! You 'll kill monsters who , despite being four legged monstrosities , will literally sprinkle you with gold coins ! The overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening ! You want a farce ? You 've got nothing but farce in Blue Stinger .	-1
People saying this a perfect game are either skateboarders are just crazy . This game is so outdated graphics are horrible , gameplay is decent at best . there is no reason this should have higher then 3 stars and for that reason I am giving it a 1 , so people will know it 's not a 4 or 5 out of 5 star game .	-1
Loser ! The cars in this game do n't leave behind any dust , they bite the dust ! It 's no wonder that Activision did n't dare tie this game directly into Interstate '76 . There is just no comparison to the classic game . I would love to compare this game but since Activision is n't doing that I wo n't either . Let 's go down the list of Graphics , Control , Game Play , Sound/Music , and Fun Factor . That will give or take one star for each category.Graphics : Where does one start on the graphics ? As far as the level of detail and the amount of destruction available , it is indeed a very good game . Games of this nature tend to over simplified with little or no detail in the buildings and surrounding terrain . Activision programmers spent a lot of time on the details in the game , I wish they spent the same amount of time on the game 's engine . The game engine plays like a first generation game . There is such an incredible amount of popping , crazing , stretching , and disappearing polygons , any good programmer should have never allowed this kind of thing to even leave his development PC . For those out of the loop I 'll define the problems.Popping- Terrain popping up out of no where . Programmers usually solve this with careful use of fog . Yes folks , that is the true use of fog . However fog in this game is under utilized . Almost like it was thrown in at the last minute.Crazing/Stretching- This tends to be very similar . Various walls or architecture seems to twist or stretch into bizarre angles . If you have the game drive the car directly up against a vertical wall and you 'll see it . The level with the lighthouse is a prime example.Disappearing polygons- This is a serious no no in games . Drive to the edge of any arena until the car & quot ; bounces & quot ; if you can get the proper slope of land ( about a 45 degree angle . ) and the camera swings low enough , parts of the ground will disappear and be replaced by a livid blue ( or red depending on the generation of PSX console or some other factor ) .Control : Unfortunately , this game ca n't decide on Arcadian controls or Real World controls , so it attempts to do a half and half deal . The car 's accelerates and steers like it 's running through molasses , unless of course it floats , then it feels like it 's skimming around on ice . In fact , control 's so bad that I tend to get and use the hovercraft mode or the boat mode more often than not . The only major saving grace is that the controls are 100 % configurable . I myself do n't like the default uses for the buttons . Especially for my style of play which involves using my thumb to press two or three buttons at the same time . ( Old School Mario Style if you will . ) Gameplay : Game play is frustrating at best . ( Why is the & quot ; Arcade & quot ; mode listed before & quot ; Quest & quot ; mode ? ) The various modes of the game should be fun , but really , are more of a frustrating exercise in patience . Past experience tells me that arcade mode is a great way to & quot ; practice & quot ; the details of the game . In this case , it actually is set up that way . Hints and tips are handed to you before each battle . Cars can be limited in number and difficulty . And goals are clearly defined . However , actually doing all of this takes a bit of work . The number of & quot ; configuration & quot ; screens one must churn through is heart breaking . Whatever happened to a & quot ; simple & quot ; game session ? And the enemies seem to be overly ruthless . Whereas quest mode seems to be the easiest of the modes , having blasted through 4 of the drivers in the first few hours of playing . I really did n't have much patience to even try the survival mode.Sound/Music : I try not to review music or sound in games but in this case it will be the only whole star for this game . The music is indeed sweet to listen to . The tunes are strangely familiar , but I ca n't place my finger on it . It also appears that there is one song for each of the characters to play . The book lists 15 characters and I believe there are 15 songs . It 's quite fun to try and match the songs to the characters . The music would have been a blast if they used real world 70 's music but alas , the licensing would be too much . The only annoying sound effect is those stinkin ' UFO 's . Kind of makes me want to turn the CD into a UFO.Fun Factor : Fun Factor ca n't get much lower . The only fun things here is the quest mode and two player mode . It 's always nice to play ANY game with two players , especially one that lets us rag on it like it 's Elevator Action ( Waaay back in the NES days . ) The quest mode is nice for those late night no-brainer sessions where your brain is too fried to think about anything else.Sorry if this review is just as jumbled as the game itself . Watching the game world twist and spin in sickening ways scrambled my poor brain . The results ? Half a star for graphics but bad engine . No stars for the controls . No stars for game play . One star for music and sound . And half a star for the fun factor . That 's all . Hope Activision 's third attempt is n't a . . . dump .	-1
I do n't think I 've ever been as angry with any software as I was with Messiah . After an hour of dying around every corner or in certain parts on the FIRST level , I immediately uninstalled it and returned it . It is my policy that any game that just about FORCES you to cheat is a bad game . Yes , the graphics in this game are good , and yes , the possession ability is an innovative thing , but all of that is WORTHLESS when you get killed so easily . 1-3 hits is all it takes , and when your host dies , expect Bob to die nanoseconds later . Even if you 're a crackshot and can kill a person without making a sound , reinforcements appear almost instantly and kill you just as quickly . The message here is that combat is best avoided ... so why am I constantly thrusted into it ? And the AI ? Superb , yet stupid at the same time . I accidentally went into combat mode with my fists at one time , and armed guards from across the ( very large ) room suddenly started shooting me ! Also , when I possessed a commander , a COMMANDER , for crying out loud , my own soldiers shot me anyway , AND I WAS N'T IN COMBAT MODE ! So I figure either A ) They have a & quot ; jealous & quot ; behavior , or B ) They 're stupid . Also , the possession ability is an innovation , but you 'll get so frustrated that you 'll hardly give it a second thought when you uninstall it . I do n't even want to think about the later levels that have you going against demons ! My conclusion is ... if you 're tired of the usual & quot ; shoot , run , repeat & quot ; games , and you 're desperate for a change in 3D shooters ... stick with & quot ; Thief : The Dark Project. & quot ; Let this game die in piece .	-1
Messiah is a third person game . Set in the future you play an angel called Bob sent from god to save the world from the bad humans . The angel is very small and weak , It can be easily killed , but it can posses any charecter it wants and take control of the charecter , Only after becoming someone it can carry weapons . The graphics and sound are average , charecter animation are not very impressive . Messiah 's problems is that it is quite difficult , To posses someone you need to fly behind him and jump into his back and that is very hard to do so because of the third person camera angle . The game is quite short too .	-1
This expansion pack ( EP ) was a complete wast of my time , and money . It adds a couple new magical weapons and armor , some new spells and a couple new areas to explore . There is no plot to the the EP , just some NPC saying & quot ; Oh I lost my son in Durlags Tower . . . . & quot ; and stuff like that . The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate , and increased Experience points to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level . By the way , it is just one more disk that you have to flip through if you decide to replay Baldurs Gate . In conclusion do n't buy this EP , it is n't worth it , unless any new EP 's come out that require it .	-1
i do n't know why others rate this so highly - the graphics are OK , i love the fact that you can play with friends ( although in the end are different schedules ruined this ) and i like importing my own pictures . But the controls for this game are absolutely frustrating ! Some minor gripes : the manual does n't have enough info , combat used to be a MAJOR pain until i stumbled over the pause commands ( and had to play with them to figure out which ones to set ) , having the main character enter a store makes life frustrating for other LAN players , the plot does n't seem multiplayer friendly ( you lose all those NPCs which are important to the story - the party is so small ) , the maps do n't make a ton of sense , group movement can be really annoying and my number one complaint : you ca n't use arrow keys to move your character ! i know , it sounds minor , but the view screen is only large enough to show a few tiles , so you have to scroll the screen , click a destination point , by which time your guy has already walked there so you scroll some more , repeat - it gets so that you never actually see your character because you 're so busy setting way points for him to walk . At a minimum , if you have to play this carpal-tunnel torture of moving your characters leg by leg , you should at least be able to make the screen center on the character - the little guy just walks off the screen and you do n't know where he went . At a minimum , let me see more of the map at one time - i have a 19 & quot ; monitor and prefer looking at what 's happening rather than the large pretty pictures some artist drew.The plot 's OK , the D & amp ; D system is pretty sophisticated , there 's some real polish in places and we 've needed a good RPG for a while ( i LOVED Fallout , which had lousy , but still vastly superior , map and movement controls ) , so i got the game the very first day it was released ( xmas eve ) , and my roommates and i played it for 2 weeks , but eventually i got so sick of the control scheme that i just erased the frustrating thing	-1
I enjoy RPG games . Really , I do . But for some reason , I could n't get into this one as much as I thought I could . But I 've looked at all the reviews on this board , and most are raving about it . But what I 'm also wondering is if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers , and/or Dungeon & amp ; Dragons fans.I personally do not play D & amp ; D , so I 'm not a die-hard . But I did enjoy Diablo , Everquest , Might and Magic 7 , and Age of Wonders , so I 'm not against & quot ; dungeon-crawl & quot ; /fantasy type games as you may think I am . I did like the & quot ; pause & quot ; option in Baldur 's Gate , so you can give commands to each of your party 's members without getting thrashed in the meantime , but I did n't care for the graphics . But to some , that 's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay -- I guess I just did n't . I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline . But if you prefer a non-linear storyline , and sometimes feeling semi-lost in a rather large world to explore , that 's all the more reason for you to get this game.I also get a tired of too much repitition . Every battle I set my formation up , pause , issue relatively the same commands , and execute . ( In Everquest , I only went up to Level 12 and quit , thinking , what 's the point ? ) So the combat is repetitive , but in Baldur 's defense , it does have a storyline and an ending , unlike Everquest . But it is time consuming . But if you can afford the time , and you like RPG 's , then you 'll love this title , otherwise , spend your gaming money elsewhere .	-1
Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels . I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is . Yes , I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I do n't see how to win this game . I was very very disappointed .	-1
I bought this game for my 7 year old son , expecting it to be a good one . The graphics are average ( better graphics can be found with Spyro , year of the dragon ) , and the levels are very frustrating , I found myself throwing the controller away several times trying to help my son get through the levels , even though I consider myself a good gamer . I finally recommended my son to play Spyro the dragon instead to avoid anymore frustrations . I wo n't recommend anyone to get this game .	-1
Okay . This game ... If you think this game is good , play Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 2 and see what you think after that . This game lacks good graphics and does n't have enough tricks to keep you awake . I mean , come on ! One lip trick ? ! Tony Hawk 's Pro Skater 2 has plenty of lip tricks , grab tricks , flip tricks , and specials . Plus , on Pro Skater 2 you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button . If you are a true Tony Hawk fan , do n't get this game . It will upset you to much .	-1
